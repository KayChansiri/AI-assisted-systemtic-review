'My Hope Is . . . ': A Hope-Based Typology of Homeless Youth,"Zhang, Neil S.; Schonberg, Jeffrey; Syme, S. Leonard; Auerswald, Colette L.","Many youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are surprisingly hopeful. We propose a typology of the hopes for the future (HFTF) of YEH, based on a qualitative study employing grounded theory. YEH fell into four categories: (a) nonmainstream HFTF youth who wished to escape the mainstream, (b) mainstream HFTF youth who wished to integrate into the mainstream, (c) marijuana-economy HFTF youth who aspired to escape homelessness by entering the marijuana economy, and (d) no HFTF youth who did not or could not envision the future. Our finding that some YEH transition between different HFTF suggests a modifiable point of intervention. We share novel findings regarding how the perceived trajectories of some YEH may have been influenced by the evolving legal status of marijuana. Our emic approach to constructing a typology may inform the design of more acceptable/effective interventions. We suggest implications, including ethical quandaries, raised by our findings.",2020,,Youth & Society,52,8,1523-1543,"SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Nonvocational Outcomes from a Randomized Controlled Trial of Two Employment Interventions for Homeless Youth,"Ferguson, Kristin M.","Purpose: This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy between the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS) with homeless youth with mental illness to assess their impact on nonvocational outcomes. Method: Seventy-two homeless youth were recruited from one agency and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received four SEI components, and IPS participants received eight IPS components. Data were collected on mental health, housing, and social support outcomes at baseline and one follow-up period. Results: Findings from mixed analysis of variance indicate that both SEI and IPS participants displayed statistically significant changes in their self-esteem, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems, inattention problems, living in a shelter, and living in a private residence. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the comparative efficacy and short-term nonvocational outcomes of SEI and IPS with homeless youth with mental illness. Assessment of long-term outcomes of both interventions is warranted.

"Social Connectedness, Self-Efficacy, and Mental Health Outcomes among Homeless Youth: Prioritizing Approaches to Service Provision in a Time of Limited Agency Resources","Begun, Stephanie; Bender, Kimberly A.; Brown, Samantha M.; Barman-Adhikari, Anamika; Ferguson, Kristin","Homeless youth frequently meet diagnosis criteria for depressive and/or substance use disorder(s). Although prior research has established that both social connectedness and self-efficacy buffer vulnerable youth's adverse health outcomes, few studies have compared the potential of these protective factors on homeless youth's mental well-being. The current study analyzes comparative effects of social connectedness and self-efficacy on meeting criteria for major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, and the co-occurrence of both disorders among a sample of 601 service-seeking homeless youth in Austin, Denver, and Los Angeles. Hierarchical logistic regressions indicate that while both social connectedness and self-efficacy constructs are valuable protective factors, social connectedness may offer greater utility, particularly in buffering against more complex mental health outcomes, such as the co-occurrence of depressive and substance use disorders. Accordingly, resource-strapped homeless youth service providers and researchers may benefit from tailoring mental health intervention strategies to further emphasize social connectedness in future efforts.",2018,,Youth & Society,50,7,989-1014,"SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Recruitment and Retention of Homeless Youth in a Substance Use and HIV-Risk Reduction Program,"Garvey, Rick; Pedersen, Eric R.; D'Amico, Elizabeth J.; Ewing, Brett A.; Tucker, Joan S.","Conducting intervention studies with homeless populations can be difficult, particularly in terms of retaining participants across multiple sessions and locating them for subsequent follow-up assessments. Homeless youth are even more challenging to engage due to substance use, mental health problems, wariness of authority figures, and frequent relocations. This article describes methods used to successfully recruit a sample of 200 homeless youth from two drop-in centers in Los Angeles, engage them in a four-session substance use and sexual risk reduction program (79% of youth attended multiple sessions), and retain 91% of the full sample at a three-month follow-up assessment. Our experience indicates that utilizing structured project materials and having a small dedicated staff are essential to recruitment and retention efforts for intervention studies with homeless youth. Using these and other nontraditional methods are likely necessary to engage this at-risk yet hard-to-reach population.",2018,,Field Methods,30,1,22-36,"SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Increasing Identification of Homeless Students: An Experimental Evaluation of Increased Communication Incorporating Behavioral Insights,"Shephard, Daniel D.; Hall, Crystal C.; Lamberton, Cait","Over 1.5 million students in the United States experience homelessness. These students are entitled to educational support through the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. However, many homeless students are not identified and therefore never receive this support. Across 1,732 local education agencies in New Jersey, New Mexico, and New York, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of increased email communication incorporating behavioral insights targeting homeless liaison staff in order to increase the identification of homeless students. The intervention had an impact on the mean number of identified homeless students among the treatment local education agencies (3.62, 90% CI [0.32, 6.92], p = 0.07). The impact remained when outliers with high leverage were removed (1.51 CI [0.24, 2.79], p = 0.05). Within this sample, our analysis indicates that more than 3,000 additional homeless students were identified with a low-cost, low-intensity, behavioral intervention during the second semester.",2021,,Educational Researcher,50,4,239-248,"SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Using survey methods, school counselors reported their knowledge, perceived competence, advocacy, and actions related to supporting students experiencing homelessness in their college preparation. The results suggested that training and the number of students experiencing homelessness on counselors' caseloads were significantly related to their knowledge and competence. Knowledge, competence, and advocacy all impacted the number of interventions utilized by participants.

Addressing Mental Health and Trauma-Related Needs of Sheltered Children and Families with Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT),Jamie A. Spiegel; Paulo A. Graziano; Emily Arcia; Shana K. Cox; Muriel Ayala; Nicole A. Carnero; Noelle L. O'Mara; Sundari Foundation,"Children and adolescents (""youth"") experiencing homelessness are at a disproportionately high risk of exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTE). However, limited evidence exists as to what interventions are effective when implemented with this high-risk population. The purpose of this study was to (1) document the mental health and trauma-related needs of sheltered youth and their mothers, and (2) examine the feasibility/effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) administered within the context of a homeless shelter. Three hundred and twenty-one youth (M[subscript age] = 10.06 years, SD = 3.24 years, 56.4% male, 70.1% Black/African American, 34.6% Hispanic/Latinx) and their mothers were recruited from a homeless shelter and provided 10 weeks of TF-CBT, with the option for up to eight additional weeks of therapy based on clinical need. Families completed pre- and post-intervention assessments. Results demonstrated clinically elevated pre-intervention PTSD symptoms and rates of exposure to PTE in sheltered youth well above those previously reported in the general population. TF-CBT resulted in substantial reductions in both maternal and self-reported severity of youth PTSD symptomology, which were largely attributable to reductions in re-experiencing and arousal. Effectiveness of TF-CBT varied by age and the number of exposures to PTE. Overall, these findings illustrate the importance of assessing and addressing the mental health and trauma-related needs of sheltered youth and the feasibility and efficacy of embedding an evidence-based trauma-focused treatment protocol within a shelter environment. Additional implications of these findings are discussed.",2022,,Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research,49,5,881-898,"Springer. Available from: Springer Nature.

Toward a New Beginning: Exploring the Instructional Dynamics of Expansive Learning with Workers in a Youth Supported Housing Unit,"Prokopis, Dimitrios; Sannino, Annalisa; Mykkänen, Arttu","Purpose: This study aims at presenting an analysis of a Change Laboratory conducted with the personnel of a youth supported housing unit for clients with a history or at risk of homelessness. The analysis is centered on how the workers' expansive learning process was supported ensuring that they would be in the lead of their workplace transformation process. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected in six Change Laboratory sessions facilitated by interventionist-researchers and were analyzed with a specific method of discourse analysis devised for tracing expansive learning at work, the method of analysis of expansive learning actions and deviation from instructional intentions. The purpose of this method of analysis is to present in a detailed and structured manner how workplace expansive learning unfolds. Findings: The results of the analysis indicate that the contribution of the practitioners participating in this Change Laboratory was such that the undertaken transformation resulting from the expansive learning process was actually owned by them. These results contribute to ongoing discussions on workplace expansive learning, which question the extent to which the Change Laboratory is truly a participatory intervention method in which the participating practitioners' agency becomes visible without the interventionists necessarily dominating. Originality/value: This study addresses existing gaps in the literature on workplace expansive learning, by opening up a novel perspective for detailed empirical enquiries that demonstrate the role workers may play in supported expansive learning processes and ensuing transformations of their workplaces.",2022,,Journal of Workplace Learning,34,7,628-642,"Emerald Publishing Limited.

Pathways of Running Away among Belgian Youth,"Glowacz, Fabienne; Léonard, Julie; Courtain, Audrey","Runaway behaviors among teenagers have been studied for some 40 years. Still, because runaway and homeless youths have often been confounded, little is known about what really defines a runaway adolescent. This study targets three objectives in a mixed-method design relying on data from official files and interviews: the descriptions of teenagers reported as missing (e.g., age, sex, runaway duration and reiteration, place left behind, type of caller reporting the child as missing, motivation for closing the file) and the understanding of runaway pathways and dynamics. These studies can contribute to prevention and intervention programs by providing new perspectives on how runaway experiences should be understood in light of the adolescent process.",2020,,Youth & Society,52,2,143-165,"SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

'I Need to Get My Culture Back': Youth and Provider Perspectives on Integrating Culturally Based Approaches into Sexual and Reproductive Health Programs for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Youth Experiencing Homelessness,Charlene Kuo; Michelle Jasczynski; Jee Hun Yoo; Jennifer L. Robinson; Katelyn Reynolds; Lisa Anoruo; Kayla Bae; Lana Sue Ka'opua; Rebecca Chavez; Jacqueline Tellei; Elizabeth M. Aparicio,"There is growing interest in decolonizing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and embedding cultural practices into social and medical services in Hawai'i. Wahine (""woman"") Talk is a multilevel, comprehensive SRH program for female youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) led by community health, social work, and medical providers. This study examines youth and program provider perspectives of culturally based approaches that may strengthen SRH programs. The study team conducted three focus groups and ten in-depth interviews with participating youth and program providers after the program's conclusion. Youth participants were aged 14 to 22 years (M = 18.1) and of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander ancestry. Interview transcripts were analyzed using structured thematic analysis. The youth described feeling estranged from their ancestral cultures and suggested incorporating multiple cultural practices to enhance their connection to community, body, and land into SRH programming for YEH. They identified several ?aina (""land"")--based approaches, hands-on learning, hula, and language as possible practices to weave into the program. While youth felt estranged from their ancestral cultures, they discussed Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander health perspectives where ?aina and relationships are considered life-sustaining. Youth and program staff stressed incorporating culture respectfully, caring for the whole person, and providing trauma-informed care. Future policy, practice, and research should consider protecting and integrating Native Hawaiian conceptions of health into SRH policy and practice and include youths' cultural identities in SRH intervention development.",2023,,Prevention Science,24,2,209-221,"Springer.

Mental disorders in former street-working boys,"Taib, N.I.; Arinell, H.; Öster, C.; Ramklint, M.","The continuity of mental disorders in street-working children is rarely studied. This study therefore investigated homotypic continuity, recurrence of the same disorder, and heterotypic continuity, when a new disorder follows on the previous, of mental disorders from childhood to adulthood in street-working boys from Duhok City, Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Mental disorders were assessed by structured diagnostic interviews in 40 street-working boys in 2004–2005 and again in 2021, when the participants’ mean ages were 12.1 (SD 1.8) and 29.7 (SD 2.3), respectively. Mental disorders were common; 24 participants (60%) satisfied the criteria for at least one diagnosis at baseline and 28 (70%) at follow-up. Comorbidity increased from 1.2 (SD 1.4) disorders initially to 2.5 (SD 1.8) at follow-up. Only anxiety disorders showed homotypic continuity. Depressive disorders exhibited the greatest increase over time whereas externalizing disorders exhibited a decreasing tendency. The number of mental disorders in adulthood was related to the number of mental disorders in childhood but not to the number of childhood traumas experienced, having previously worked for more than two hours per day, having worked for over two years on the streets, or having at least one dead parent as a child. Parental ratings on the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) from childhood were also unrelated to the number of adult disorders. More longitudinal studies with bigger samples of both genders are needed to fully evaluate the continuity of mental disorders in street-working children and to determine whether the number of mental disorders in childhood is a stronger predictor of being mentally disordered in adult life than psychosocial risk factors or experiences of internalizing or externalizing symptoms in childhood. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,Eur.

Exploring Mental Health Services for Youth Experiencing Homelessness in East Asian Pacific Regions: A Systematic Scoping Review,"Ermita, K.C.; Rosenthal, D.M.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) in East Asian Pacific (EAP) regions represent one of the most at-risk populations due to cultural and geographical factors. Effective mental health interventions, primarily researched in Western contexts, may not fully apply to YEH in EAP. Their lack of stable shelter, disrupted social networks, and limited access to mental health services elevate their susceptibility to adverse mental health, making urgent interventions essential to address their needs. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore and systematically search the types of mental health services and interventions available for YEH in EAP and their impact on overall quality of life and wellbeing. Methods: Electronic databases (e.g., Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus) were systematically searched (publication dates between 1 January 1990 and 13 May 2023), as well as additional online resources specific to homelessness. Articles were screened, and a critical appraisal assessed the quality of the included studies. Results: Eight studies with different interventions were identified in Indonesia (n = 2), Malaysia (n = 1), South Korea (n = 3), and the Philippines (n = 1). These were thematically clustered into six categories: art, cognitive behavioural therapy, life skills education, resilience enhancement, family strengthening, and government interventions/services. Conclusions: This review highlights effective mental health interventions’ positive impact on YEH mental health outcomes and quality of life in EAP, stressing the urgent need to implement socio-culturally sensitive services. Future research should address knowledge gaps through comprehensive studies covering diverse EAP regions and populations, prioritising socio-culturally specific psychological measures. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Child.,11,7,,,10.3390/children11070864,,#46,Ermita 2024,,
A Novel Framework for Guiding Psychotherapy for Youth Who Have Experienced Homelessness,"Hamel, K.; Vitopoulos, N.; McDonald, K.; Kidd, S.","Youth who have experienced homelessness are impacted by disproportionately high levels of mental health symptoms, which contribute to vastly decreased well-being and early mortality. Despite a salient need for mental health support, several recent reviews have shown that few, if any, interventions currently applied to this group appear to improve mental health consistently. Furthermore, community mental services present many barriers to access for this population, given the impacts of social determinants of health on youths’ ability to engage in the available supports, the ongoing instability faced by many of these youths, and the lack of applicability of existing services to youth. A challenge exists for clinicians who work with this population of youth and wish to provide effective supports, given these obstacles and an inadequate evidence base on which to inform treatment. The purpose of this article is to propose a framework for care to inform psychotherapeutic treatment for clinicians providing mental health supports to youth with experiences of homelessness. This framework is cross-modality, transdiagnostic, and research-informed and seeks to provide a structure with which to frame treatment that acknowledges and responds to the various obstacles that practitioners frequently encounter in working with this population. The framework is accompanied by illustrative case studies to demonstrate how this framework may be applied using different treatment modalities. The hope in sharing this framework is to promote more intentional and effective interventions with this chronically underserved population of youth and also to increase the self-efficacy of those practitioners who are doing this important work. © 2024 American Psychological Association",2024,,Prof. Psychol.

Substance use typologies among young people experiencing homelessness in seven cities across the United States: A latent class analysis,"Brown, S.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Garcia, K.; Chassman, S.; Hsu, H.-T.; Petering, R.; Santa Maria, D.; Narendorf, S.; Shelton, J.; Bender, K.; Ferguson, K.","Background: Substance use and other health-risk risk factors, including mental health, trauma, and sexual-risk behaviors, often co-occur among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). The present study aimed to identify subgroups of YEH based on polysubstance use and the linkages to sociodemographic and health-risk characteristics. Methods: From June 2016 to July 2017, 1,426 YEH (aged 18–26 years) were recruited from seven cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, New York City, St. Louis, San Jose). Participants provided information via a self-administered electronic survey on substance use, mental health, trauma, sexual risk behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics. The majority of YEH identified as Black (37.3%), cisgender (92.8%), and heterosexual (69.2%). On average, YEH were 20.9 years (SD = 2.1). This study employed latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of YEH according to their substance use. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify sociodemographic and health-risk characteristics associated with class-membership. Results: Four latent classes of YEH substance use were identified: (1) high polysubstance use; (2) moderate stimulant and high marijuana, alcohol, and prescription drug use; (3) high marijuana, alcohol, and prescription drug use; (4) low/moderate marijuana and alcohol use. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated that geographic location, gender, race/ethnicity, mental health, trauma history, and sexual risk behaviors were significant correlates of substance use class membership among YEH. Conclusions: These findings offer important implications for the prevention and treatment of substance use among YEH. Screening protocols should consider co-occurring risk factors such as traumatic experiences, sexual risk behaviors, and mental health history as indicators of polysubstance use. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Addict.

‘Bridge-builders’ and ‘boundary spanners’: a qualitative study of youth workers’ perceptions of their roles and practices with vulnerable young people in school-based settings,"Corney, T.; Gorman, J.; Woods, B.; Benedict, N.; Law, A.","This paper presents a qualitative study of 22 youth workers’ perceptions of their roles and practices in seven school-based settings in a large post-industrial city in regional Australia. Youth workers are often engaged in school-based settings working with vulnerable young people, yet knowledge of how workers perceive and conceptualize their role and practice in these settings remains limited. Through focus group interviews, youth workers were asked how they engage, and work with vulnerable students, how they conceptualize their roles and the bodies of knowledge to which those practices and roles pertain. We find that youth work in school-based settings requires the dynamic and non-linear application of the practices of youth accompaniment, family support and youth-centred advocacy, underpinned by respect for the dignity, autonomy and agency of the young person. We argue that the complex application of these practices positions youth workers as ‘bridge-builders’ and ‘boundary-spanners’. Bridge-builders assist young people to connect and engage with support services. Boundary-spanners build relationships across service providers to network different organizations and professionals for better collaboration and support of young people. These findings have implications for youth policy and practice in the area of youth work with vulnerable young people in school-based settings. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Unaccompanied Unstable Housing Among Racially, Ethnically, Sexually, and Gender Diverse Youth: Intersecting Identities Bearing the Greatest Burden","Houghtaling, L.M.; Simon, K.; Gower, A.L.; McCurdy, A.; Rider, G.N.; Russell, S.T.; Eisenberg, M.E.","Disparities in youth homelessness by racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender identities are well documented, though this literature lacks specificity regarding intersectional social identities of youth who are most likely to experience homelessness. Population-based cross-sectional data on youth from the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey (N=80,456) were used to examine the relationship between parent caring and intersections of minoritized identities that experience the highest prevalence of two distinct types of unaccompanied unstable housing with expanded categories of sexual and gender identities. Exhaustive chi-square automatic interaction detection models revealed that low parent caring was the most common predictor of unaccompanied homelessness and running away, but there was important variation among youth of color at the intersection of sexual and gender identities. The findings reveal a more complex story of disparities in unaccompanied unstable housing among youth with multiple marginalized social identities and highlight the need to create culturally informed prevention and intervention strategies for parents of LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning) youth of color. The implications for prevention and intervention among subgroups with the highest prevalence are discussed in the context of interlocking systems of power and oppression. © 2024 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice",2024,,Am.

The aim of this study was to describe the lifestyle of street adolescents (sexual practices and drug use), to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses, and to describe their HBV immunization profile in Togo. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lomé (Togo) in July 2021. Street adolescents aged between 13 and 19 years were included. A questionnaire was used to document lifestyle. ELISA tests were performed for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core and surface antibodies (anti-HBc, anti-HBs), and antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Results: A total of 299 adolescents (5.4% female) with a median age of 15 years (IQR: 14–17) were included. Of these, 70.6% (211/299) were sexually active and 70.6% (149/211) had not used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Drug use was reported by 42.1% of the adolescents. The most used substances were cannabis (39.0%), cocaine (36.6%), glue solvents (19.5%), and tramadol (11.4%). However, cocaine use may have been overestimated due to information bias. Current HBV infection (HBsAg+) was detected in 3.7% (95%CI: 1.9–6.5) of the adolescents. Isolated anti-HBc + was present in 5.3%. All three HBV markers (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc) were negative in 71.6% of adolescents. Anti-HCV was detected in 4.7% of adolescents. Conclusion: Nearly one in 10 street adolescents has markers for HBV contact/current infection, and approximately 72% of street adolescents may still be infected with HBV, as they have no HBV markers. HCV is also circulating in this population. Given the reported high-risk sexual practices and high levels of drug use, there is an urgent need to develop integrated strategies to prevent infections, including HBV, and drug dependence in this population. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,BMC Public Health,24,1,,,10.1186/s12889-024-19415-8,,#59,Sadio 2024,,
Is residential care a risk factor for teenage pregnancy? A study on the experiences of young women's discharge and transition from residential care in Trinidad and Tobago,"Roberts, P.","Some English-speaking Caribbean nations continue to maintain large residential homes for children and youth who need out-of-home care. My doctoral study with alumni from a number of these homes reported that their overall experiences were positive. However, transition and discharge were less favourable, with women suffering more hardships than men. These hardships included homelessness, which often led to sexual exploitation for women. A number of young women became pregnant within a year of discharge from the home (which normally happened at the age of 16 or 18). An unplanned pregnancy can have immediate and lasting consequences for a young woman's health, education, and income-earning potential. It often alters the course of her entire life. This study provides information from a sample of 15 young adult women in Trinidad and Tobago on the risk factor of living in a residential care facility and unplanned teenage pregnancy.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 259 male street children (aged 10 –21 years old). We collected the data through questionnaire interviews, history taking, physical examination, and specimen collection for STI and HIV testing. Results: 5.8% (n = 15) STI cases were discovered, consisting of Hepatitis B (n = 6), Hepatitis C (n = 1), HIV (n = 2), Chlamydia (n = 3), Syphilis (n = 1), and Gonorrhea (n = 1). Buskers (44.4%) and other occupations like helping parents sell their wares, parking lot attendants, shoe shiners, or gathering (44.8%) dominated the sociodemographic characteristics. Condomless sex predominated risky sexual behavior, despite some subjects already having good knowledge. Conclusion: Sociodemographic characteristics and the KAP of street children in Indonesia are varied. The association between the KAP level and STI cases in street children is challenging to describe. Further studies covering more areas in Indonesia are required. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,Int. J. STD AIDS,35,2,112-121,,10.1177/09564624231202058,,#64,Nilasari 2024,,
Navigating and negotiating “outness” among 2S/LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness,"Goodyear, T.; Knight, R.; Fast, D.; Oliffe, J.L.; Jensen, M.; Kia, H.; Jenkins, E.","There are important implications associated with coming and being out for Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer, and other sexual and gender minority (2S/LGBTQ+) people. “Outness” is indeed imbued with risks, particularly in contexts of visibility and structural precarity. This community-based study used photovoice methods, including data from 61 semi-structured interviews with 32 2S/LGBTQ+ youth (ages 17-29), to examine how they navigate and negotiate outness in connection with homelessness. Our reflexive thematic analysis was guided by theoretical perspectives related to gender and queer performativity, hegemonic masculinities, and strategic outness. We developed four themes: (i) being out in/of harm's way, (ii) norming outness, (iii) concealing outness, and (iv) masc-ing up. Across these thematic findings, we characterize the stakes of coming out and being outed with respect to trajectories and experiences of homelessness for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth. Moreover, we examine youths’ dynamics of managing outness to broker access to services and housing and mitigate anti-2S/LGBTQ+ and gender-based discrimination and violence risks. Findings detail how youth negotiate the tensions between what they perceive and experience as possible with respect to outness in the context of homelessness and pursuing belonging, safety, material security, and housing. Recognizing these efforts while addressing long-standing inequities in homelessness for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth is a necessary pursuit. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Child. Youth Serv.

Assessing the association between safety perceptions and communication about sex and drugs among Black adolescents exposed to adversity,"Smith, B.D.; Spencer, B.H.; Nur-Singletary, Z.; Adane, N.; Moser, N.; Powell, T.","The present study examined the association between safety perceptions and communication with a trusted adult about sex and drugs among Black adolescents exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and the role of gender as a potential moderator in this association. Data were drawn from a small, randomized control pilot test of an adapted evidence-based intervention conducted from 2022 to 2023 in Baltimore, Maryland. The sample included 57 Black adolescents who had been exposed to ACEs (Mage = 15.14 years, SD = 0.81l; 47.4% female, 52.6% male). Information about safety perceptions, health communication, health behaviors, and demographic characteristics was measured using an electronic survey at baseline. Group differences by gender emerged among ACEs and substance use behaviors. Safety perceptions were significantly associated with communication with a trusted adult, B = 0.31, SE = 0.24, p =.039. As youth felt more unsafe, their communication with a trusted adult about sex and drugs increased; this association did not differ by gender. Health communication was also associated with ACEs. Black adolescents living with a parent with mental health challenges reported increased communication, B = 0.60, SE = 0.20, p =.005, whereas youth experiencing homelessness had reduced health communication, B = -0.63, SE = 0.24, p =.012. A lack of perceived safety significantly impacts health communication; however, having trusted adults outside of the home, school, and neighborhood can serve as a protective factor in reducing substance use and sexual risk-taking among this population. © 2024 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.",2024,,J.

Leveraging Culturally-Relevant Urban Social Housing to Address Indigenous Youth Homelessness and Transitions Out of Government Care,"Morton, D.; Conlon, Q.; Delorme, Q.; Pierce, A.; Rieu, J.; Terrain, R.; Hatala, A.","Indigenous children and youth are overrepresented in settler-colonial child protection systems globally. They experience higher rates of homelessness and housing precarity when leaving care and searching for family and a place to call home. Missing from Canadian policy and research discussions is the role social housing can play to address these realities by providing a social safety net for permanent low-barrier housing. In this article, we highlight a community-based Solutions Lab that analyzed discursive policy constructions of ‘youth transition’ and explored the implications of austerity-driven social housing reform in a mid-sized metropolitan Canadian city.

Environmental Risks Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness: The Need for Justice,"Slesnick, T.D.; Slesnick, N.","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face unique environmental injustices. Although the current environmental justice literature has recognized the impact of environmental risks on adults experiencing homelessness, there is a significant gap in understanding the distinct challenges faced by unaccompanied youth aged 14–24 years. Compared with adults, YEH are particularly vulnerable to health risks and the long-term consequences of homelessness. In this article, we argue that the environmental risks faced by YEH—such as inequitable access to clean air, food, water, and sanitation—will lead to adverse long-term health and quality-of-life outcomes. In addition, most YEH avoid services that might be available to them due to administrative, transportation, and financial barriers as well as a lack of trust, likely compounding their risks. This further underscores the need for environmental justice interventions to address the unique challenges faced by YEH. Some solutions for adults experiencing homelessness have been proposed, including public fountains and easily accessible restroom facilities, but solutions and their implementation for YEH remain unstudied. Future research and policy efforts that engage YEH as agents of social change are likely essential for the success of any potential solution. That is, the use of Community-Based Participatory Action Research principles can be useful in future efforts to understand and reduce health inequities. Recognizing the unique environmental injustices experienced by YEH is a first step toward creating a more equitable and inclusive approach to environmental policy and societal intervention that ensures the well-being of this vulnerable population. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2024,,Environ.

Extended foster care and homelessness: Assessing the impact of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act on rates of homelessness among youth,"Spindle-Jackson, A.; Byrne, T.; Collins, M.E.","Youth aging out of foster care experience high rates of homelessness during young adulthood. This study assessed the impact of states’ extension of foster care through age 21 under the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 on state-level rates of homelessness among all youth ages 18–24, which we used as a proxy to assess impact on the legislation's target population. To do so, we leveraged data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Census Bureau and several other publicly available data sources to construct a novel state-level panel dataset that allowed us to capture changes in rates of homelessness among youth ages 18–24 and extended foster care policies in all 50 states for the eight-year period from 2013 to 2020. Employing a difference-in-difference approach, we found evidence of an anticipated lagged effect of extended foster care, wherein the implementation of extended foster care is associated with a 23 % reduction in the total rate of youth homelessness four years later. This effect persists in years five to six after states adopt this policy change. We found no evidence of a similar effect of extended foster care on rates of homelessness among persons not between the ages of 18–24. Our findings provide important evidence about the impact of the Fostering Connections Act and suggest that extending the age of foster care eligibility may create important safety nets and pathways that support a reduction in rates of homelessness among former foster youth. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Child.

"A feasibility (pilot) mixed methods study of an innovative non-pharmacological breath-based yoga and social-emotional intervention program in an at-risk youth sample in London, Canada","Vasudev, A.; Ionson, E.; Sathiaselan, J.; Thatipalli, A.; Chauhan, A.; Hassan, C.; Sukhera, J.; Speechley, M.; Forchuk, C.","Background: Various service provision models for youth at risk of homelessness have been researched and implemented, including access to housing and physical and mental health resources. However, even with these interventions, we remain unaware of how best to manage symptoms of depression and anxiety and the rate of drug use in these populations primarily because of a lack of feasibility data. Methods: This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods study in London, Canada, that examined the feasibility of implementing a biopsychosocial intervention, SKY Schools, in at-risk youth aged between 16 and 25 (n = 49). The study also recorded qualitative responses about the program’s usefulness from the perspective of the service users. The SKY Schools intervention consisted of social-emotional learning combined with Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, a standardized yoga-based breathing exercise routine. The intervention program was divided into two phases: an active learning phase and a reinforcement phase. The following feasibility outcome measures were collected: (1) the number of potential participants approached per month, (2) number (proportion) who were successfully screened, (3) the proportion of screened participants who enrolled, (4) the rate of retention in the study, (5) rate of adherence to study protocol, (6) proportion of planned ratings that were completed, (7) intervention cost per case, (8) completeness of final data for analysis, (9) length of time to collect all data, (10) quality of all collected data, (11) determining if partnering community organizations were willing to conduct the study as per study protocol, (12) determining if there were any capacity issues with partners providing intervention and investigators being able to perform the tasks that they were committed to doing, (13) determining if there were any problems of entering the data into a computer, (14) preliminary data about the safety of the intervention, and (15) preliminary estimate of treatment effects. Results: All feasibility outcome measures were collectible. In the city of London, Canada it was feasible to conduct a pilot study in this population of youth at risk of homelessness. Foremost among the findings was a high retention rate (61.2%) and overall positive qualitative feedback with a number of potential suggestions to improve the delivery and quality of the intervention. However, we had a significantly low recruitment rate (0.27 participants per week) suggesting that multiple sites will be needed to achieve an adequate sample size for a subsequent definitive trial. Conclusions: Future researchers may consider the findings of this feasibility study when designing a randomized control trial to further assess the efficacy and tolerability of SKY Schools.

"Mapping community-based youth mental health services in Tasmania, Australia","Savaglio, M.; Yap, M.; Vincent, A.; Skouteris, H.","Background. Tasmania has the most rurally and remotely dispersed population of young people in Australia with high rates of youth experiencing mental ill health and socioeconomic disadvantage. Standard descriptions of mental healthcare provision are necessary for evidence-informed mental healthcare policy, planning and implementation. This systematic scoping study aimed to: (1) map and describe the characteristics of community-based youth mental health services (including substance-use) for young people in Tasmania, Australia and (2) identify gaps in service accessibility and provision. Methods. A list of eligible services was developed through a systematic search and consultation with key stakeholders. Data were collected from a representative from each eligible service via an interview or online survey. A standardised framework was used to classify, describe and map services. Thematic analysis was used to analyse service providers’ perceived gaps to service access and provision. Results. Twenty-eight community-based mental health services for youth were identified, predominantly located in the major city of Tasmania’s three service regions. Service gaps include the ‘missing middle’, lack of integrated supports and limited service capacity. Conclusions. The findings highlight the limited availability, accessibility and capacity of youth mental health services across Tasmania. Recommendations focus on increasing accessibility of rural/regional supports, provision of assertive outreach, psychosocial support, integrated care and strengthening the rural mental health workforce. These findings may inform the (re)design/ (re)development of community-based youth mental health services in Tasmania. The findings may also guide evidence-informed mental health service planning, decision-making, development and implementation of integrated models of youth mental health care across Australia. © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Psychological capital variables as protective factors in indigenous youth experiencing homelessness,"Rew, L.; Kelley, M.; Preston, A.","Indigenous youth in the United States are at high-risk for experiencing homelessness related to adverse childhood experiences such as parental substance use and low educational attainment. Such experiences may lead to adverse physical and mental health issues; these youth also have positive attributes of psychological capita (hope, self-efficacy, resilience, optimism) that are related to health outcomes. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to describe demographic attributes and psychological capital in Indigenous youth experiencing homelessness (IYEH) who participated in a longitudinal intervention study related to safe sex behaviors and life satisfaction. From a total of 602, Indigenous participants (n = 111; mean age 21.25 ± 1.82 years) were recruited from drop-in centers in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio. Data were collected immediately after the intervention and at 3- and 6-month intervals. For this analysis, only data collected at the final time-point were used. Valid scales with Cronbach alphas of 0.75–0.92 (Hope, Resilience, Optimism, Self-efficacy for Substance Refusal, Self-efficacy for Safer Sex, Safe Sex Behaviors, Social Connectedness, and Life Satisfaction) were used. The majority of the IYEH reported smoking, drinking, and using drugs. Psychological capital variables of hope, self-efficacy for negotiating safer sex, resilience, and optimism were significantly related to one another, but not to safe sex behaviors or intention to use condoms. Resilience and optimism were significantly related to social connectedness but not to other psychological capital variables. Life satisfaction was significantly associated with hope, resilience, and optimism. Findings have implications for further theory and research development. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2024,,Arch.

Despite finding a high prevalence rate of inhalant abuse, our work suggests an absence of supporting structures and emphasizes the need to revisit our understanding and interpretation of substance-using behavior of street-involved youth. Instead of explaining inhalant-abusing behavior as emerging from pathological deficiencies in individuals or households, we stress the need to critically examine the exploitative environment they are embedded in. In doing so, we join efforts to decolonize conventional ways of understanding “deviant” behavior. © 2024 Society for Research on Adolescence.",2024,,J. Res.

Structural vulnerabilities and over-criminalization of LGBTQ + youth in the California justice system,"Kynn, J.; Boyke, H.; McCarthy, S.; Gzesh, A.S.","Purpose: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ + ) youth are overly represented in the juvenile justice system, which stems from their structural vulnerability. LGBTQ + youths’ structural vulnerability, the societal criminalization of LGBTQ + individuals’ sexual and gender expression, and over-policing place these youth at greater risk of being charged with prostitution and related offenses. In turn, this study examines the relationship between youths’ gender identity, sexual orientation, structural vulnerability, and over-criminalization with the likelihood of being charged with prostitution or related charges, controlling for race/ethnicity and age. In doing so, the study offers insight to the mechanisms producing LGBTQ + youths’ structural vulnerability. Methods: This study draws on the Criminalization of LGBQ/GNCT Youth data, which contains data on youth incarcerated in 46 of the 48 juvenile detention facilities in California in 2014 (N = 4,033). The data include information regarding youths’ sexuality, gender identity, race/ethnicity, child welfare system involvement, homelessness, and charges leading to detention. Results: LGTBQ + youth had significantly higher odds of being incarcerated for prostitution and related charges than cisgender and straight youth. Experiencing family rejection and being detained more than once was significantly related to the odds of being incarcerated for prostitution and related charges. Conclusion: LGBTQ + youth have significantly higher odds of being incarcerated for prostitution related offenses, which illuminates the nature of their structural vulnerability that place these youth at risk for justice involvement.

"Locational citizenship, exclusion and inclusion. The case of street children in Ethiopia","Adefris, D.; Gatbel, K.; Moss, S.M.","Public space is a possible site for grounding a social psychology of citizenship. Locational citizenship speaks to the right to have a place in public space. Certain groups are however often excluded. Drawing on individual interviews and focus group discussions with street children in Gambella Town, Ethiopia, this study explores how street children talk about their lives on the street. The results demonstrate the children's lack of inclusion in locational citizenship, and how public space becomes contested space when different groups use these places in ways that clash. The children also speak to processes of inclusion, both among groups of street children, and kindness from individual adults in their environment. These children's their stories of both exclusion and inclusion are crucial to the developing social psychology of citizenship. The study emphasizes exclusion and inclusion as processes, and the children's active handling of their street life. We also problematizes the division between private and public space when the former is often no longer an available space for these children. © 2023 The Authors.

While an increasing number of empirical interventions have sought to address the high burden of psychopathology in this population, findings remain mixed regarding intervention effectiveness. In this systematic review of behavioral health interventions for TAY-EH, we sought to examine the structural framework in which these interventions take place and how these structures include or exclude certain populations of youth. We also examined implementation practices to identify how interventions involving youth and community stakeholders effectively engage these populations. Based on PRISMA guidelines, searches of Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were conducted, including English language literature published before October 2022. Eligible studies reported on interventions for adolescent or young adult populations ages 13–25 years experiencing homelessness. The initial search yielded 3850 citations; 353 underwent full text review and 48 met inclusion criteria, of which there were 33 unique studies. Studies revealed a need for greater geographic distribution of empirically based interventions, as well as interventions targeting TAY-EH in rural settings. Studies varied greatly regarding their operationalizations of homelessness and their method of intervention implementation, but generally indicated a need for increased direct-street outreach in participant recruitment and improved incorporation of youth feedback into intervention design. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine the representation of various groups of TAY-EH in the literature on substance use and mental health interventions.

Discovering sources of resilience among homeless LGBTQ+ youth in out-of-home care in Israel: An ecological framework,"Mazursky, N.","Background: LGBTQ+ youth in out-of-home care experience multiple stressors due to being a minority group, in out-of-home care, and rejected by their families. Therefore, they tend to be vulnerable. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the sources of the resilience of homeless LGBTQ+ youth in out-of-home care in the Israeli context. The research question was: What are the experiences, perceptions, and constructions of “resilience” among LGBTQ+ youth who aged out of out-of-home care for homeless LGBTQ+ youth in Israel? Methods: The study employed a critical constructivist grounded theory approach. Thirty-one in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with LGBTQ+ youth aged 16 to 32 (average age of 21.5) and analyzed. Results: The data analysis presents the sources of resilience according to four levels. (1) The individual level refers to self-acceptance, faith and hope, and creativity and productiveness. (2) The interpersonal level refers to friends and peer groups, educational institutions, employment environments, professionals, and LGBTQ+ out-of-home care services. (3) The macro level refers to public visibility of the LGBTQ+ community and financial support. (4) Finally, the chrono level refers to the development of rights and recognition over time. Conclusions: An ecological model was implemented to conceptualize resilience among LGBTQ+ youth in out-of-home care in Israel. This multidimensional model was used to construct resilience sources that could assist in overcoming adversities among these youth.

Housing experiences of new mental health service users: specific characteristics and developmental issues,"Roy, L.; Baki, A.A.; Crocker, A.; Benedictis, L.D.; Latimer, É.; Thibeault, E.; Bérubé, F.-A.; Roy, M.-A.","Objectives Access to stable, safe, and affordable housing is an important determinant of health and community integration among people living with mental illness. Previous studies on housing stability, housing satisfaction and residential preferences among people living with mental illness have primarily been conducted among those with extensive service use experiences. First-time mental health service users, and youth in particular, are likely to present with distinct housing needs. The current study aimed to explore the housing experiences of new mental health service users, as well as the perceived obstacles and facilitators to their residential stability. Methods Projet AMONT is a longitudinal mixed-methods cohort study on the residential trajectories of service users in the 36 months after their initial contact with psychiatric services. The qualitative component consisted in a qualitative descriptive study. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with fourteen individuals at the beginning of their service use trajectory. Findings The thematic analysis uncovered how the emergence of mental illness and initial contacts with psychiatric services are associated with transformations in the area of housing and, for many, with housing instability. This instability might occur in continuity with adverse early life trajectories, or through the disruption caused by the emergence of mental illness. Informal social support emerged as the main protective factor against housing instability. Housing satisfaction was associated with multiple and sometimes conflicting needs regarding privacy, safety, social interactions, response to basic needs, performance of activities of daily living, and community integration. The specific developmental issues of youth at the beginning of their service use trajectories influence housing stability and satisfaction. Their housing then becomes a reflection of and laboratory for identity exploration and consolidation. Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of adopting a homelessness prevention lens among people living with a first episode of mental illness, particularly youth with adverse early life trajectories. Many existing approaches could be implemented or strengthened: cross-sector partnerships with all actors present in the trajectories of people with emerging mental illness; family approaches in early intervention, peer support, and screening for unstable housing situations. Adapting practices to the specific developmental characteristics of youth seem to be a key for homelessness prevention for this population. © 2024, Revue Santé Mentale au Quebec.

Rethinking narratives about youth experiencing homelessness: The influence of self-determined motivation and peer relations on coping,"Napoleon, J.-S.; Weva, V.K.; Evans, D.W.; Namdari, R.; Francois, T.; Sherman, J.; Morisseau, N.; Lafontant, E.; Atkinson, K.; Miller, S.; Kidd, S.A.; Burack, J.A.","Using the cognitive appraisal theory of coping and the self-determination theory of motivation, we examined the shared variance of motivational orientations, attachment relationships, and gender on adaptive and maladaptive coping among youth experiencing homelessness. Several scales including The Global Motivation Scale (assessing motivational orientations; i.e., autonomous and controlled motivation), the Brief Cope (adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies), and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (self-perceptions of relationships with mothers, fathers, and peers) were administered to 102 youth aged between 16 and 24 (Mage = 20, SD = 2.07) years recruited from an evening program for youth experiencing homelessness in Montreal, Canada. Autonomous motivation was positively associated with engagement in effective coping strategies, while controlled motivation was positively linked to maladaptive coping. Moderation analyses were used to examine whether gender and relationships with attachment figures moderated the relationship between motivation and coping. A significant main effect of peer attachment on adaptive coping emerged, in which greater peer attachment was related to more adaptive coping among the youth. No interaction effects resulted. Although no significant moderating effects were associated with essential relationships and gender, further research implementing a more nuanced approach to assessing the interaction between these constructs may be warranted. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of intervention programs for youth experiencing homelessness, that focus on enhancing autonomous motivation and utilizing peer support to optimize the use of adaptive coping strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

Family conflict as ontological (in)security for young people with experiences of homelessness,"Roche, S.; Barker, J.; Noble-Carr, D.","Experiences of family conflict are common in young people's accounts of homelessness, yet in-depth explorations and conceptualisations of these experiences remain sparse. Drawing on focus group discussions with 29 participants, this article explores the accounts of young people and carers and parents about the dynamics, interactions and characteristics of family conflict. Findings highlight the primacy of verbal insults, criticisms or threats, as well as acts of aggression and violence in young people's and parent's understandings of family conflict. Feelings of mistrust, instability and a lack of safety also pervade family conflict and are considered its most impactful elements. We contend that these impacts are best understood via the concept of ontological (in)security, whereby young people's sense of self, belonging and stability are undermined by family conflict. This provides important insights for developing practice in this space, where working to remove long-term patterns of family conflict, restoring young people's sense of self and belonging within their family, and supporting the stability and trust within a family may prove beneficial. © 2023 The Authors.

Mediation of Psychological Capital in Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Rew, L.; Slesnick, N.; Kesler, S.; Rhee, H.","Background Youth who experience homelessness engage in behaviors that place them at high risk for disease and injury. Despite their health risk behaviors, these youth display psychological capital, positive attributes of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism that motivate them to engage in health-promoting behaviors such as safer sex. However, this array of positive psychological attributes has not been studied in this vulnerable population. Objectives The specific aim of this analysis was to determine whether factors of psychological capital mediated the relationship between background risk factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, educational attainment, reason for being homeless, sexual abuse history, and HIV status) and outcomes of condom intention, safer sex behaviors, and life satisfaction among youth who participated in a longitudinal intervention study. Methods Using a Solomon four-group design, 602 youth were recruited from drop-in centers in two large cities (Columbus, Ohio, and Austin, Texas) to participate in a brief intervention that included outcomes of enhanced communication skills, goal setting, safer sex behaviors, drug refusal skills, and life satisfaction. Using an autoregressive, cross-lagged, longitudinal mediation model, we tested the direct and indirect effects of background factors, psychological capital, and intervention outcomes. Models were tested for the intervention group alone and the total sample. Results There were no significant direct or indirect effects of background factors on intervention outcomes among the intervention group, and the model fit was poor. There were also no significant mediating paths via factors of psychological capital and poor model fit for the combined group. Discussion Findings provide important information about intrinsic strengths of youth experiencing homelessness and psychological capital as a significant construct for understanding health behaviors among disadvantaged and underserved youth. The lack of significant mediation effects may have been due, in part, to the lack of a robust measure of psychological capital. Further study with various background factors and outcomes would contribute further to our understanding of how best to support this population.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The Mediating Role of Resilience and Living in Care on Psychosocial Outcomes,"Ungar, M.; Shahidi, M.; Jefferies, P.; Shojaee, M.; Clark, E.A.","Purpose: This study examined the mediating role of resilience and living in care experiences between risk exposure (victimization by community and adverse childhood experiences) and psychosocial outcomes (housing instability, delinquency, and post-traumatic stress reactions) for youth receiving child welfare and community services. Method: Two hundred and fifty-one youths (14–19 years old) who are receiving interventions from the Department of Community Services in Nova Scotia, Canada, were recruited. Multiple measures were administered to the youth. Results and conclusion: Resilience and experiences of living in care significantly mediated the relationship between risk factors and outcomes, with youth demographic characteristics influencing the pattern of these relationships. Findings suggested that resilience and living in care experiences could reduce the effects of risk factors on psychosocial outcomes. These findings demonstrate a role for Child Welfare agencies in promoting youth access to the resilience-enabling resources necessary to sustain well-being. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,Res. Soc.

Multisystemic factors predicting street migration of children in Kenya: A multilevel longitudinal study of families and villages,"Goodman, M.; Theron, L.; McPherson, H.; Seidel, S.; Raimer-Goodman, L.; Munene, K.; Gatwiri, C.","Background: Street-migration of children is a global problem with sparse multi-level or longitudinal data. Such data are required to inform robust street-migration prevention efforts. Objective: This study analyzes longitudinal cohort data to identify factors predicting street-migration of children – at caregiver- and village-levels. Participants and setting: Kenyan adult respondents (n = 575; 20 villages) actively participated in a community-based intervention, seeking to improve factors previously identified as contributing to street-migration by children. Methods: At two time points, respondents reported street-migration of children, and variables across economic, social, psychological, mental, parenting, and childhood experience domains. Primary study outcome was newly reported street-migration of children at T2 “incident street-migration”, compared to households that reported no street-migration at T1 or T2. For caregiver-level analyses, we assessed bivariate significance between variables (T1) and incident street-migration. Variables with significant bivariate associations were included in a hierarchical logistical regression model. For community-level analyses, we calculated the average values of variables at the village-level, after excluding values from respondents who indicated an incident street-migration case to reduce potential outlier influence. We then compared variables between the 5 villages with the highest incidence to the 15 villages with fewer incident cases. Results: In regression analyses, caregiver childhood experiences, psychological factors and parenting behaviors predicted future street-migration. Lower village-aggregated depression and higher village-aggregated collective efficacy and social curiosity appeared significantly protective. Conclusions: While parenting and economic strengthening approaches may be helpful, efforts to prevent street migration by children should also strengthen community-level mental health, collective efficacy, and communal harmony. © 2024",2024,,Child Abuse Negl.,154,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.106897,,#120,Goodman 2024,,
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders’ Identity and Housing Status: The Impact on Historical Trauma and Perceived Stress,"Palafu, T.; Carreira Ching, D.L.; Acosta, V.M.; Okamoto, S.K.; Okamura, K.H.","Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are overrepresented in Hawai‘i’s houseless population. Indigenous populations, such as NHPIs, may encounter experiences of historical trauma that impact their well-being. This original research project examines how NHPI identity and houselessness compound to affect the perceived stress and historical trauma of transition-aged youth. Fifty-one participants aged 18 to 24 (M = 21.37, SD = 1.93) completed a survey that included the historical traumatic events scale, historical loss scale, perceived stress scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Over half (n = 26, 51.0%) of the participants identified as NHPI. A two-way ANOVA indicated a non-significant effect of NHPI identity and housing status on perceived stress. However, housed participants scored significantly higher than participants experiencing houselessness on the historical traumatic events scale (p = 0.006).

Researching effective practices to reduce youth homelessness and disadvantage from a young person's perspective: A systematic review,"Rambaldini-Gooding, D.; Keevers, L.; Clay, N.; MacLeod, L.","Pathways into and the impact of homelessness on young people have been extensively explored. There is less emphasis on young people's perspectives of the interventions designed to assist them to avoid or exit homelessness. This study undertook a systematic review of the youth homelessness interventions literature that included the perspectives of young people experiencing these interventions. Our review identified five key approaches as useful in assisting young people to exit or avoid homelessness, namely (1) the centrality of relationships, (2) a youth-centred approach, (3) integrated and multi-disciplinary service provision, (4) a beyond housing approach and (5) strength-based therapeutic models/interventions. The review enhances the capacity of practitioners to provide supportive and contextually situated services to young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. However, further research is required to understand the bundles of interconnected practices within these approaches that are performed by workers and young people to address homelessness and risk. © 2024 The Authors.

Understanding Homelessness Among Young People to Improve Outcomes,"Milburn, N.G.; Rice, E.; Petry, L.","In the United States, an estimated 4.2 million young people experience homelessness during critical stages in their development—adolescence and emerging adulthood. While research on youth homelessness often emphasizes risk and vulnerability, the field must situate these issues within the developmental trajectories of adolescence and emerging adulthood to effectively prevent and end youth homelessness. This review uses the Risk Amplification and Abatement Model (RAAM) as a conceptual framework for contextualizing the landscape of youth homelessness research in the United States since 2010. An extension of ecological models of risk-taking, RAAM emphasizes both risk and resilience, positing that negative as well as positive socialization processes across interactions with family, peers, social services, and formal institutions affect key housing, health, and behavioral outcomes for youth experiencing homelessness. This review applies RAAM to our understanding of the causes and consequences of youth homelessness, recent interventions, and recommendations for future directions.

Characterizing Use of Supervised Consumption Services among Street-involved Youth and Young Adults in the Context of an Overdose Crisis,"Lee-Pii, K.; DeBeck, K.; Choi, J.; Sedgemore, K.-O.; Kerr, T.; Kennedy, M.C.","In response to an increase in overdose deaths, there was a rapid scale-up of supervised consumption services (SCS), including federally sanctioned SCS and low-barrier SCS known as overdose prevention sites (OPS), in Vancouver, Canada, beginning in December 2016. However, little is known about the use of such services among adolescents and young adults (AYA) in this context. We therefore sought to characterize factors associated with the use of federally sanctioned SCS and OPS among street-involved AYA who inject drugs in Vancouver during an overdose crisis. From December 2016 to March 2020, data were collected from a prospective cohort of street-involved AYA aged 14 to 26 at baseline. Using multivariable generalized estimating equation analyses, we identified factors associated with recent use of federally sanctioned SCS and OPS, respectively. Among 298 AYA who inject drugs, 172 (57.8%) and 149 (50.0%) reported using federally sanctioned SCS and OPS during the study period, respectively. In multivariable analyses, public injecting, negative police interactions, and residing or spending time ≥ weekly in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood were all positively associated with the use of federally sanctioned SCS and OPS, respectively. Additionally, ≥ daily unregulated opioid use and residential eviction were positively associated with federally sanctioned SCS use, while requiring help injecting was inversely associated. Self-identified female or non-binary gender was also positively associated with OPS use (all p < 0.05). Both federally sanctioned SCS and OPS successfully engaged AYA at heightened risk of adverse health outcomes. However, the lack of accommodation of AYA who require manual assistance with injecting at federally sanctioned SCS may be inhibiting service engagement. © The New York Academy of Medicine 2024.",2024,,Urban Health,101,2,233-244,,10.1007/s11524-024-00849-9,,#131,Lee-Pii 2024,,
"What Works to Promote Resilience in the Lives of Street-Involved Boys in León, Nicaragua? A Grounded Theory Model with Implications for Intervention","Hamel, K.; Bohr, Y.; Singh, Y.","Over 100 million children and youth around the world live in precarious street situations, most of whom are boys living in low- and middle-income country contexts. Although this vast group of youth is exposed to substantial hardship, it is increasingly evident that there are resilient processes underway that allow many of these young people to survive and thrive. The objective of the current research was to examine resilience in a group of male Children and Youth in Street Situations (CYSS) in León, Nicaragua, to identify the factors in the boys, in their relationships and in their environments that facilitate their experiences of resilience. This study used qualitative data collected through individual interviews and focus groups with CYSS, their family members, community members, and staff of a local non-profit. A grounded theory analysis led to the generation of a context-specific model of resilience that specifies those factors associated with the experience of resilience in this sample. The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of resilience as a dynamic, context-specific process that emerges through the interactions between children, their relationships, and their environments. The identification of resilience-enhancing factors present in the lives of CYSS in León is considered a first crucial step in developing culturally and contextually relevant interventions to support the resilience of this group. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,ADV RES SCI,5,3,295-319,,10.1007/s42844-024-00130-7,,#132,Hamel 2024,,
HIV self-testing: A highly acceptable and feasible strategy for reconnecting street adolescents with HIV screening and prevention services in Togo (The STADOS study),"Sadio, A.J.; Kouanfack, H.R.; Konu, R.Y.; Gbeasor-Komlanvi, F.A.; Azialey, G.K.; Gounon, H.K.; Tchankoni, M.K.; Amenyah-Ehlan, A.P.; Dagnra, A.C.; Ekouevi, D.K.","HIV self-testing is a complementary screening strategy that could facilitate access to HIV care services for street adolescents. The objectives of this study were to assess the acceptability and feasibility of HIV self-testing and their associated factors, to estimate HIV prevalence among street adolescents in Togo, and to describe the sexual behavior of this population. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2021 and May 2022 in Lomé and Kara (Togolese cities with the highest number of street adolescents). Street adolescents aged 13–19 years were included. An oral HIV self-test (OraQuick®) was used. Acceptability was defined as the proportion of adolescents who completed the test, and feasibility was defined as the proportion of adolescents who reported a test with a valid result. An HIV serological test was performed for all participants. A weighted logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the acceptability and feasibility of HIV self-testing. Results A total of 432 street adolescents (12.3% female) with a median age of 15 years, interquartile range (IQR) [14–17], were included in this study. Of the 231 sexually active adolescents, only 30.3% (n = 70) reported having used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. HIV self-test was offered to a sub-sample of 294 street adolescents. Acceptability was 96.6% (284/294), (95%CI = [93.8–98.3]) and feasibility 98.9% (281/284), (95%CI = [97.0–100.0]). Being 16 years of age or older (aOR = 28.84; p<0.001) was associated with HIV self-test acceptability. Reporting drug abuse (aOR = 0.47; p = 0.020) was negatively associated to acceptability. Having an educational level at least equivalent to secondary school was associated to HIV self-testing feasibility (aOR = 3.92; p = 0.040). Self-test results were correctly interpreted by 98.6% of street adolescents. HIV prevalence was estimated at 0.9% (95%CI [0.4–2.4]). Conclusion HIV self-testing is acceptable and feasible among street adolescents, a population at high risk of HIV infection in Togo. The provision of HIV self-testing kits, coupled with condom distribution, represents an opportunity to improve access to HIV care services. © 2024 Sadio et al.

Describing the development and implementation of a novel collaborative multidisciplinary approach to deliver foot health supports for individuals experiencing homelessness and its outcomes,"Ogrin, R.; Rushford, M.-A.; Fallon, J.; Mannix, R.; Quinn, B.; Lewis, A.","Basic foot care is a real need of people experiencing homelessness. To improve access to foot health for this group, three services structured to provide healthcare support for people experiencing homelessness collaborated in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia: an established nurse-led Homeless Persons Program (HPP), a specialty community health podiatry clinic servicing people experiencing homelessness, and a charity supporting disadvantaged communities providing free socks, foot first aid kits and second-hand footwear for distribution by nurses and podiatrists of participating services. This paper outlines the implementation and evaluation of this collaboration. A four stage implementation approach was used, addressing: 1. Who needs to do what differently? 2. What are the barriers and enablers that need to be addressed? 3. Which intervention components could overcome the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers? 4. How can the changes be measured? The evaluation prospectively collected information about how HPP nurses referred adults to podiatry, and whether the referred individuals accessed the podiatry clinic, the outcomes of the podiatry visit, and how many received footwear, socks and foot first aid kits provided by the non-profit organisation. Over 1st June 2019 and 31st December 2020, 52 individuals were identified as adults who could potentially benefit from podiatry by the HPP nurses, of which 33 accessed podiatry. Those who did not visit the podiatry clinic were more likely to be born outside of Australia, live in more precarious housing (crisis accommodation and rough sleeping), have slightly more predisposing factors for homelessness, but have fewer medical, psychological and cognitive conditions. A structured approach including processes, education, regular, outreach to youth refuges and formal outcome monitoring enabled foot health care access in people experiencing homelessness. Further research is needed to ascertain how to support participants at risk of foot problems to access podiatry before their foot health issue reaches crisis point. © 2024 Ogrin et al.

"How do Students Involved with a Campus Support Program for Students with a History of Foster Care, Relative Care, or Homelessness Fare After Graduation?","Schelbe, L.; Geiger, J.M.; Schoborg, C.; Jackson, L.A.","Background: Postsecondary education can provide opportunities for students from traditionally hidden populations like those who have experienced foster care or homelessness. To assist these students, campus support programs (CSPs) provide a wide range of services and activities. Objective: Evidence of the impact of CSPs is limited, and little is known about how students who were involved in CSPs fare at or after graduation. This study seeks to address these gaps in knowledge. Methods: This mixed-methods study surveyed 56 young people involved in a CSP for college students who have experienced foster care, relative care, or homelessness. Participants completed surveys at graduation, 6 months post-graduation, and one-year post-graduation. Results: At graduation, over two-thirds of the students felt completely (20.4%) or fairly (46.3%) prepared for life after graduation. Most felt completely (37.0%) or fairly confident (25.9%) that they would get a job after graduation. Six months after graduation, 85.0% of the graduates were employed, with 82.2% working at least full-time. 45% of the graduates were enrolled in graduate school. These numbers were similar a year after graduation. Post-graduation, participants described areas of their lives that were going well, obstacles and hardships faced, changes they would like to see in their lives, and post-graduation needs. Across these areas themes were present in the areas of finances, work, relationships, and resilience. Conclusions: Institutions of higher education and CSP should assist students with a history of foster care, relative care, and homelessness to ensure that after graduation, they have adequate money, employment, and support. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2024,,Child Youth Care Forum,53,1,25-49,,10.1007/s10566-023-09746-9,,#138,Schelbe 2024,,

Typologies of stably housed youth who experienced independent homelessness,"Krieg, A.; Coward Bucher, C.","Experiencing homelessness as an adolescent has significant effects on a person's life course outcomes. This includes lower grades and graduation rates, as well as, serving as a barrier to the creation of healthy social networks and stable employment. Previous research focuses on homelessness and the experience youth have on the street. The current research examines the process of exiting homelessness and reconnecting with social institutions. Using the National Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we run hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to propose a typology of youth exiting homelessness. We build on previous work by establishing a fourth category to the typology of youth exiting homelessness, which we call “tenuously stable”. Additionally, we find that risky behavior, substance use, and childhood trauma are important factors in determining youth's successful exits.

Homeless youth with intellectual disabilities: Precarious lives and health inequalities,"Fudge Schormans, A.; Baker Collins, S.; Allan, H.; Allen, D.O.; Gray, N.","Background: Youth with intellectual disabilities experiencing homelessness are invisible within multiple service sectors. We know little about their experiences of homelessness, or the impacts of such on the social and physical health and well-being. Methods: We used quantitative and qualitative methods to measure prevalence and learn from key informants and homeless youth with intellectual disabilities about factors leading to and sustaining homelessness, and the implications of such on their social, physical, and mental health and well-being. The project involved seven co-researchers with intellectual disabilities and experience of youth homelessness in research design, data collection, analysis, and dissemination. We created Forum Theatre scenes that creatively represent the findings of the project. In this paper we share one of those scenes, as well as the recommendations three co-researchers with intellectual disabilities have for improving support to homeless youth with intellectual disabilities. Findings: Lack of awareness of and about homeless youth with intellectual disabilities, combined with siloed ways of working by involved sectors, results in significant disadvantage and health inequities for youth. Also revealed was the likelihood this would continue given existing obstacles to accessing appropriate housing and supports to exit homelessness. Conclusion: Services providers, policy makers and representatives of the involved sectors need to recognize and acknowledge homeless youth with intellectual disabilities and take responsibility for learning and working together to develop integrated and responsive approaches to effectively supporting them. © 2024 The Authors.

Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic for Youth Housing and Homelessness Services,"Farnish, K.A.; Schoenfeld, E.A.","Youth homelessness is a growing crisis in the United States that is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. A variety of social service programs exist to address youth homelessness and its consequences, such as street outreach and diversion services, emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, and rapid rehousing services, among others. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached the United States in early 2020, altering nearly every facet of daily life, including the way social service organizations structure and deliver their programming. To understand the implications of the pandemic on housing and homelessness services for youth, the current study examines data from interviews conducted with staff from a large non-profit in Austin, Texas, serving vulnerable transition-age youth. Through these interviews, programmatic changes that occurred as a result of COVID-19—as well as challenges and facilitators to service delivery—were identified.

Exploring Pathways to Healthcare Coordinated for Youth Experiencing Homelessness in Toronto, Canada, Using Grounded Theory Methodology","Hudani, A.; Labonté, R.; Yaya, S.","About 900 youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) reside at an emergency youth shelter (EYS) in Toronto on any given night. Several EYSs offer access to healthcare based on youths’ needs, including access to primary care, and mental health and addictions support. However, youth also require healthcare from the broader health system, which is often challenging to navigate and access. Currently, little is known about healthcare coordination efforts between the EYS and health systems for YEH. Using grounded theory methodology, we interviewed 24 stakeholders and concurrently analyzed and compared data to explore pathways to healthcare coordinated for youth who reside at an EYS in Toronto. We also investigated fundamental parts (i.e., norms, resources, regulations, and operations) within the EYS and health systems that influence these pathways to healthcare using thematic analysis. A significant healthcare coordination gap was found between these two systems, typically when youth experience crises, often resulting in a recurring loop of transition and discharge between EYSs and hospitals. Several parts within each system act interdependently in hindering adequate healthcare coordination between the EYS and health systems. Incorporating training for system staff on how to effectively coordinate healthcare and work with homeless populations who have complex health needs, and rethinking information-sharing policies within circles of care are examples of how system parts can be targeted to improve healthcare coordination for YEH. Establishing multidisciplinary healthcare teams specialized to serve the complex needs of YEH may also improve healthcare coordination between systems, and access and quality of healthcare for this population. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,Qual.

Risk factors for homelessness and housing instability in the first episode of mental illness: Initial findings from the AMONT study,"Roy, L.; Leclair, M.; Crocker, A.G.; Abdel-Baki, A.; de Benedictis, L.; Bérubé, F.-A.; Thibeault, E.; Latimer, E.; Roy, M.-A.","Aim: People living with mental illness are more likely than the general population to experience adverse housing outcomes, including homelessness. The aim of the current study is to examine residential status when participants have their first contact with mental health services, and the correlates of residential status at that moment. Methods: First-time mental health service users were recruited from seven clinical sites across Québec. Data on residential status at entry in the project, as well as demographic, clinical and social variables, were collected using self-report and interviewer-rated questionnaires. Participants were classified as ‘Homeless’, ‘At risk of homelessness’ and ‘Stably Housed’, and correlates of residential status were identified through multivariate logistic regression and unbiased recursive partitioning. Results: Among the 478 participants, 206 (43.1%) were in stable housing, 171 (35.8%) were at risk of homelessness and 101 (21.1%) were classified as homeless. Placement in a youth protection facility was strongly associated with adverse housing outcomes, while having a high school diploma and more social support were associated with more stable housing situations. Conclusions: First-time mental health service users are likely to experience a range of adverse housing situations, indicating the potential for clinical sites to implement homelessness primary prevention strategies. Factors related to family, foster care and schooling seem to be particularly salient in understanding risk of homelessness in first-time mental health service users, calling for intersectoral action to prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in this population. © 2024 The Authors.

Unraveling substance abuse among Malawian street children: A qualitative exploration,"Banda, L.O.L.; Banda, J.T.; Banda, C.V.; Mwaene, E.; Msiska, C.H.","This qualitative study adopts a phenomenological and symbolic interactionist approach to comprehensively explore substance abuse among street children in Lilongwe, Malawi. The research aims to uncover the complex sociocultural, economic, and environmental determinants influencing substance abuse within this marginalized cohort. Through in-depth semistructured interviews, the study engages with street children to understand their subjective experiences, perceptions, and interpretations of substance abuse within their community context. Employing convenience, purposive, and snowball sampling strategies, the research collected data from street children, acknowledging their transient nature and societal challenges. Thematic analysis was conducted on interview transcripts to derive comprehensive insights. Results revealed five key thematic areas: familial absence and emotional void, societal normalization and peer pressure, economic hardships, coping mechanisms, environmental accessibility, and peer influence and belongingness. These themes highlighted the intricate interplay between personal experiences, socio-environmental factors, and peer dynamics, shaping the prevalence and persistence of substance abuse among street children. This study's implications for practice underscore the need for tailored interventions and support mechanisms addressing substance abuse within this demographic. It emphasizes the urgency for context-specific strategies and policy formulations aimed at ameliorating the challenges faced by street children dealing with substance abuse in Malawi. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of substance abuse among marginalized street children, advocating for compassionate and contextually sensitive interventions within this overlooked drug abusers' population subset. © 2024 Banda et al.

"Bounding systems: A qualitative study exploring healthcare coordination between the emergency youth shelter system and health system in Toronto, Canada","Hudani, A.; Schwan, K.; Labonté, R.; Yaya, S.","Background Several youth staying at emergency youth shelters (EYSs) in Toronto experience poorly coordinated care for their health needs, as both the EYS and health systems operate largely in silos when coordinating care for this population. Understanding how each system is structurally and functionally bound in their healthcare coordination roles for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) is a preliminary step to identify how healthcare coordination can be strengthened using a system thinking lens, particularly through the framework for transformative system change. Methods Forty-six documents, and twenty-four semi-structured interviews were analyzed to explore how the EYS and health systems are bound in their healthcare coordination roles. We continuously compared data collected from documents and interviews using constant comparative analysis to build a comprehensive understanding of each system's layers, and the niches (i.e., programs and activities), organizations and actors within these layers that contribute to the provision and coordination of healthcare for YEH, within and between these two systems. Results The EYS and health systems are governed by different ministries, have separate mandates, and therefore have distinct layers, niches, and organizations respective to coordinating healthcare for YEH. While neither system takes sole responsibility for this task, several government, research, and community-based efforts exist to strengthen healthcare coordination for this population, with some overlap between systems. Several organizations and actors within each system are collaborating to develop relevant frameworks, policies, and programs to strengthen healthcare coordination for YEH. Findings indicate that EYS staff play a more active role in coordinating care for YEH than health system staff. Conclusion A vast network of organizations and actors within each system layer, work both in silos and collaboratively to coordinate health services for YEH. Efforts are being made to bridge the gap between systems to improve healthcare coordination, and thereby youths' health outcomes.  © 2024 Hudani et al.

Substance use and psychiatric phenotypes of youth experiencing homelessness: A cluster analysis,"Burke, C.W.; Lanni, S.; Hoeppner, B.B.; Ducharme, P.; Wilens, T.E.","Background and Objectives: Due to the complex interactions of psychopathology, psychosocial stressors, and risk behaviors, characterizing high-risk phenotypic groups of transitional-age youth experiencing homelessness (TAY-EH) for targeted interventions remains difficult. We aimed to uncover specific phenotypes of TAY-EH based upon psychiatric and substance use disorder (SUD) diagnoses, and to assess relationships between these phenotypes and negative outcomes including suicidality and high-risk behaviors. Methods: Participants (N = 140; 57% male, 54% Black) were individuals aged 16–25 years accessing support at a psychosocial agency in the U.S. Northeast. Data were gathered via structured assessment. Cluster analysis identified sub-groups of TAY-EH with differing diagnostic patterns. Bivariate analyses examined associations between cluster membership and target outcomes. Results: A four-cluster solution was identified. Cluster 1 (Co-occurring; N = 33) was characterized by high levels of comorbidity (i.e., major depressive disorder (MDD), SUD, and notable levels of other diagnoses). Clusters 2 (MDD alone; N = 47) and 3 (SUD alone; N = 18) were characterized by single diagnoses. Cluster 4 (None; N = 42) was characterized by low levels of psychopathology. Clusters differed significantly on several variables including suicidality, adverse childhood experiences, and social connectedness. Comorbid MDD and SUD were most strongly associated with high-risk behaviors and suicidality. Discussion and Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of diagnosis and targeted interventions for co-occurring MDD and SUD to address the crisis of early mortality and other negative outcomes among TAY-EH. Scientific Significance: This study is the first to identify specific high-risk psychiatric and psychosocial phenotypes among the highly complex group of TAY-EH based upon structured diagnostic assessments. © 2024 The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry (AAAP).",2024,,Am.

The bidirectional association between psychiatric disorders and sheltered homelessness,"Nilsson, S.F.; Wimberley, T.; Speyer, H.; Hjorthoj, C.; Fazel, S.; Nordentoft, M.; Laursen, T.M.","Background Psychiatric disorders and homelessness are related, but temporal associations are unclear. We aimed to explore the overlap between hospital-based psychiatric disorders and sheltered homelessness. Methods This population-based cohort study was conducted using the Danish registers e.g., the Danish Homeless Register and the Danish National Patient Register. The study cohort included all individuals aged 15 years or older, living in Denmark at least one day during 2002-2021 (born 1984-2006). First psychiatric diagnosis was used to define psychiatric disorder and first homeless shelter contact to define homelessness. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and cumulative incidences were estimated. Results Among 1 530 325 individuals accounting for 16 787 562 person-years at risk aged 15-38 years, 11 433 (0.8%) had at least one homeless shelter contact. Among 1 406 410 individuals accounting for 14 131 060 person-years at risk, 210 730 had at least one psychiatric disorder. People with any psychiatric disorder had increased risk of sheltered homelessness relative to individuals with no psychiatric disorder [IRR 9.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.8-9.6]. Ten years after first psychiatric disorder, 3.0% (95% CI 2.9-3.1) had at least one homeless shelter contact. Individuals experiencing homelessness had increased risk of any psychiatric disorder compared to individuals with no homeless shelter contact (IRR 7.0, 95% CI 6.7-7.4). Ten years after first homeless shelter contact, 47.1% (45.3-48.0) had received a hospital-based psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusion Strong bidirectional associations between psychiatric disorders and homelessness were identified. Health and social care professionals should be aware of and address these high risks of accumulated psychiatric and social problems.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

"Undernutrition and determinants among adolescent street children in DireDawa City, eastern Ethiopia: Vulnerability assessment","Nigatu, A.; Abdureshid, N.; Abate, S.; Dagne, I.; Oumer, A.","Objectives: Adolescents go through rapid development and increased nutritional requirements that can put them at higher risk of undernutrition–a problem that can be highest among orphaned or street children. Evidence on nutritional risk and its contributing factors among this segment is lacking in the city of Dire Dawa, where many children are on the streets with limited access to proper care. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of undernutrition among street adolescents in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 358 street adolescents 12 to 19 y of age in Dire Dawa from January to February 2022. After conducting a preliminary survey and registering all available street children, a complete enumeration was made. For data collection, an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used along with anthropometric measurements using standard procedures. Height-for-age (HAZ) and body mass index (BMI) for age z scores were computed using World Health Organization (WHO) Anthroplus and statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 26. Independent variables with P < 0.25 in bivariable analysis were included in multivariable logistic regression, and variables with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A crude and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported. Results: Among 358 street adolescents, 44% (38.9–49.5) and 56% (50.8–61.4) were thin and stunted, respectively. Thinness among street children could be associated with a longer stay on the street (AOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.40–1.90), infrequent meal frequency (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19–1.45), unprotected drinking water sources (AOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.40–1.71), alcohol drinking (AOR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.51–4.32), inadequately diversified diet (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06–1.36), and illness history (AOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.21–1.47). Moreover, odds of stunting were significantly associated with staying on the street (AOR, 1.32; 1.10–1.54), unsafe drinking water (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.13–2.66), smoking cigarettes (AOR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21–2.52), dietary diversity (AOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.43–3.82), and acute illness (AOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.31–5.23). Conclusion: Thinness and stunting were prevalent among street children and are associated with infrequent meals, poor dietary diversity, substance abuse, unsafe water sources, and illness histories that could be targeted for multisectoral interventions. © 2023 The Author(s)",2024,,Nutrition,119,,,,10.1016/j.nut.2023.112307,,#172,Nigatu 2024,,
"COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake, Infection Rates, and Seropositivity Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness in the United States","Santa Maria, D.M.; Padhye, N.; Ostrosky-Zeichner, L.; Grimes, C.Z.; Nyamathi, A.; Lightfoot, M.; Quadri, Y.; Paul, M.E.; Jones, J.T.","Background: People experiencing homelessness are at greater risk of exposure and poor health outcomes from COVID-19. However, little data exist on the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 among homeless populations. To mitigate the spread and severity, uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is needed. This can be challenging among youth experiencing homelessness who are more likely to be unvaccinated when compared to stably housed youth. Objective: We conducted this study to determine the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 among youth experiencing homelessness. Methods: We examined experiences of COVID-19 symptoms, self-report of infection, and rates of COVID-19 antibodies and distinguished between natural and vaccinated immunity among youth experiencing homelessness (N = 265) recruited in one large metropolitan area in the south. Results: Based on self-report, very few participants experienced any symptoms, and 80% had never been diagnosed with COVID-19. Of those with COVID-19 antibodies (68%), the proportion with antibodies resulting from natural infection was 44%. The vaccination rate was 42%. Younger and vaccinated participants and those in shelters were likelier to have COVID-19 antibodies. Black and Hispanic youth were more likely than White youth to have had COVID-19. Those who adopted only one or two prevention behaviors were more likely to acquire a natural infection than those who adopted three or more prevention behaviors. Discussion: Youth experiencing homelessness report low vaccination rates, disrupted access to healthcare and social supports, and underlying chronic conditions, which may explain why they face poorer outcomes when infected with COVID-19. Vaccination and risk mitigation strategies to combat the high prevalence of COVID-19 are especially needed for sheltered youth who are at high risk yet are often asymptomatic.

Barriers and Facilitators to Accessing Opioid Agonist Therapy for Street-involved Adolescents and Young Adults in Vancouver,"Gallant, K.; Nijjar, P.; DeBeck, K.; Cui, M.; Kerr, T.","Objective: Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) remains the first-line therapy for people with opioid use disorder. Whereas overdose rates among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) remain high, little is known about their access to OAT. Therefore, we sought to evaluate factors that shape access to OAT among AYAs aged 14 to 26 years. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort study that involves street-involved AYAs who use illicit substances in Vancouver, Canada. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with OAT enrollment from September 2005 to October 2021. Results: A total of 759 AYAs reported at least weekly opioid or OAT use, with a median age of 23 years and 65.7% self-identifying as male. At baseline, 147 participants (19.4%) were on OAT, and another 199 (26.2%) initiated OAT during study follow-up (median number of follow-up visits, 5 [Q1–Q3, 2.5–8]). In a multivariable analysis, being <19 years old (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23–0.71), Indigenous ancestry (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52–1.00), homelessness (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54–0.77), drug dealing (AOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.87), daily opioid use (AOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.40–0.55), and nonfatal overdose (AOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.89) were negatively associated with OAT use. Conclusions: This study identified a low rate of OAT access among AYAs. Adolescents and young adults were less likely to be on OAT if they were <19 years old, Indigenous, and possessed certain risk markers. These findings highlight the need for mitigation strategies to facilitate OAT access for this population and for additional harm reduction measures to support AYAs who do not want to use OAT.

Hunger and housing: Economic disparities in current and daily tobacco use among high school students in the United States in 2021,"Mantey, D.S.; Janda-Thomte, K.M.; Alexander, A.C.; Omega-Njemnobi, O.; Kelder, S.H.","Introduction: Economic disparities in tobacco use and dependence are well-documented among adults but not adolescents. This study aims to examine economic disparities in patterns of tobacco use among a nationally representative sample of high school students in Spring 2021. Methods: We analyzed data from n = 6750 US high school student via the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES). We estimated the association between experiencing homelessness and food insecurity (analyzed independently) and current (past 30-day) and daily (all 30 days) use of four tobacco products (e-cigarettes; cigarettes; cigars; smokeless). Models controlled for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and sexual identity. Results: Overall, ∼1.8 % experienced homelessness and 23.7 % experienced food insecurity. Experiencing homeless was significantly associated with greater odds of current use for e-cigarette (aOR: 3.43), cigarettes (aOR: 5.58), cigars (aOR: 10.47), and smokeless tobacco (aOR: 4.41) as well as greater risk for daily use of e-cigarettes (aOR: 2.66), cigarettes (aOR: 10.94), and cigars (aOR: 5.23) but not smokeless tobacco (aOR: 2.48; 95 %CI: 0.51–12.16). Food insecurity was significantly associated with greater odds of current use of e-cigarettes (aOR: 2.00), cigarettes (aOR: 2.15), and cigars (aOR: 2.44) but not smokeless (aOR: 1.04; 95 % CI: 0.56–1.93). No association was observed between food insecurity and daily tobacco use. Conclusion: Substantial economic disparities in tobacco use were observed in a nationally representative sample of high school students. Interventions should consider prioritizing economic determinants of health during adolescence, including a focus on preventing youth tobacco use as well as addressing upstream determinants of homelessness and food insecurity. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Preventive Med.

Social Determinants of Health and Psychological Capital Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Preston, A.J.; Rew, L.; Spees, J.","Background: Social determinants of health affect health behaviors and outcomes. Youth experiencing homelessness suffer significant deprivation of resources such as inadequate housing, reduced education, poor health care, and decreased economic stability. Inner resources, such as psychological capital, may also be related to health behaviors and health outcomes. Objective: In this study, we sought to describe and explore associations among selected determinants of health and self-reported scores on indicators of psychological capital among youth experiencing homelessness. Methods: This cross-sectional secondary analysis was conducted with a randomized subsample of 148 youth. We calculated chi-square frequencies to describe the data, classical item analyses to evaluate responses, and correlation tests to examine significance of associations. Results: Youth in this sample demonstrated that they possess inner resources associated with determinants of health. Education, health care, and social support were significantly associated with attributes of psychological capital (hope, efficacy, resilience, optimism). Sexual minority groups had high representation in this subsample (25.7%), indicating a need for more study and equitable services for this population. Conclusion: More research should be conducted to better understand the associations between determinants of health, psychological capital, and health behaviors among disadvantaged youth to advance health equity initiatives. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,West.

Although protective factors, such as positive adult relationships, are key elements for healthy development throughout adolescence and young adulthood, they remain less understood among PPYEH. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 11 female participants (ages 15–20) in a shelter-based health program, we conducted a qualitative analysis to explore protective factors among PPYEH. Guided by a theory-informed codebook, we identified individual, interpersonal, organizational, and community-level factors that supported the health of PPYEH. Individual factors included youths’ future orientation, sexual health and contraceptive knowledge, understanding/prioritization of personal and child health, self-efficacy and engagement in their parent role, and ability to navigate complex systems. Interpersonal factors included meaningful parent–child relationships and multidimensional support from family and school. Organizational factors included instrumental support from school and shelter, shelter rules and policies, and the benefit of the shelter compared to previous housing circumstances. Community factors included having access to and satisfaction with primary care, easy access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, and a network of professional supports. Societal-level protective factors were not identified.

Identifying Novel Motivation Phase-Specific Cessation Targets for Youth Experiencing Homelessness in the United States,"Nemeth, J.M.; Glasser, A.M.; Macisco, J.; Hinton, A.; Wermert, A.; Patterson, J.G.; Sucaldito, A.; Gilson, C.; Kemble, H.; Garbsch, E.; Caponi, J.","Introduction: Of youth experiencing homelessness (YEH; 14–24 years old), 70%+ smoke combustible, commercial tobacco. Though many have tried to quit, most use ineffective methods. Drop-in centers for YEH are opportune places to link YEH to evidence-based treatment. Using the Phase-Based Model (PBM) for Cessation Research, the aim of this study was to identify “Motivation” phase-specific challenges impacting YEH’s willingness to make a quit attempt—the goal of this cessation phase. Aims and Methods: Surveys were interview administered with 96 past-week combusted tobacco users accessing drop-in services. Regression models were fit to confirm hypothesized challenges impacting YEH’s willingness to quit. Results: Moderate nicotine dependence was noted—a key Motivation phase cessation mechanism targeted—and was associated with population challenges including, but not limited to, replacing food with tobacco, accidental oxygen-deprivation events, and smoking to socialize. While 67.1% of participants made a past-year quit attempt, 45.8% expressed 30-day quit interest. Dimensions of coping with housing were associated with quit attempts and quit interest. Quit attempts were also associated with nicotine dependence, working, and smoking to socialize. Whereas, quit interest was associated with less endorsement of smoking to regulate affect and more endorsement to avoid danger. Conclusions: Though common challenges targeted in Motivation phase cessation exist among YEH, other challenges may also need to be addressed to promote quitting. © The Author(s) 2023.

The Problematisation of Young People Within Existing Housing-Related Policy in Queensland,"Keen, L.; Newcomb, M.","More young people are experiencing homelessness and housing stress in Australia than ever before, with policy responses failing to address a current housing and cost-of-living crisis. Of particular concern when considering increasing rates of youth homelessness and housing stress is the absence of research examining existing policy. This research was undertaken in the Australian state of Queensland and contributes to addressing this gap in knowledge by utilising Carol Bacchi’s (2009) ‘What’s the Problem Represented to be?’ approach to policy analysis to examine three state policies, namely Towards Ending Homelessness for Young Queenslanders 2022–2027, the Queensland Housing Strategy 2017–2027, and the Queensland Youth Strategy. A range of discourses were found which position young people as lacking knowledge and skills to obtain housing. Emphasis is also placed on education, training, and employment as solutions to youth housing issues rather than a genuine focus on empowering young people through policy and practice initiatives. The findings of this research mirror existing discourses found in global conversations about youth homelessness and housing stress and contribute to a growing knowledge base around the importance of engaging young people in decision making within public policy and social reform. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,JAYS,,,,,10.1007/s43151-024-00144-z,,#192,Keen 2024,,
Impact trajectories of childhood maltreatment duration on affective and social development,"Ardizzi, M.; Ravera, R.; Umiltà, M.A.; Ferroni, F.; Ampollini, S.; Kolacz, J.; Porges, S.; Gallese, V.","Childhood maltreatment (CM) deeply impacts victims' social competences. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect that CM duration exerts on victims' affective and social development testing three different impact trajectories (i.e., linear, logarithmic and quadratic) and its physiological (facial mimicry and autonomic regulation of the heart) and behavioral (percentage of anger recognition false alarm) markers. In a cross-sectional design, 73 Sierra Leonean youths (all males, 5-17 years old) were enrolled in the study. Of those, 36 were homeless all abandoned at the age of 4 and exposed to CM, whereas 37 were controls. Only physiological markers of affective development were influenced by CM duration. A quadratic relation between the autonomic regulation recorded at rest and CM duration was found, indicating initial physiological compensation followed by progressive autonomic withdrawal. Furthermore, CM duration was associated to a specific linear decrease of facial mimicry and vagal regulation in response to angry and sad facial expressions whereas no influences were detected for happy and fearful faces. The results of the present study provide insightful clues on victims' natural patterns of resilience, deterioration, and chronicity, allowing a deeper comprehension of the developmental pathways through which early life adversities place youths on a track of lifelong health disparities.  © The Author(s), 2024.",2024,,Dev.

Intervention acceptability, feasibility, and motivational interviewing fidelity were evaluated. Results. Nearly all participants would recommend the MNI to others, formed goals, and believed the program improved their lives. Case managers delivered the program with fidelity. However, sample size and number of sessions delivered fell short of targets due to COVID-19 disruptions and other factors and limited our ability to examine preliminary effects on substance use and network outcomes in a fully powered trial. Conclusion. Case managers can successfully deliver the MNI, but its use may not be feasible unless adaptations are made to accommodate the instability this population faces when they enter housing. © Meharry Medical College.",2024,,J.

Reducing mental health emergency visits: population-level strategies from participatory modelling,"Vacher, C.; Ho, N.; Skinner, A.; Crosland, P.; Hosseini, S.H.; Huntley, S.; Song, Y.J.C.; Lee, G.Y.; Natsky, A.N.; Piper, S.; Hasudungan, R.; Rosenberg, S.; Occhipinti, J.-A.; Hickie, I.B.","Background: Emergency departments (EDs) are often the front door for urgent mental health care, especially when demand exceeds capacity. Long waits in EDs exert strain on hospital resources and worsen distress for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. We used as a test case the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), with a population surge of over 27% across 2011–2021 and a lagging increase in mental health care capacity, to evaluate population-based approaches to reduce mental health-related ED presentations. Methods: We developed a system dynamics model for the ACT region using a participatory approach involving local stakeholders, including health planners, health providers and young people with lived experience of mental health disorders. Outcomes were projected over 2023–2032 for youth (aged 15–24) and for the general population. Results: Improving the overall mental health care system through strategies such as doubling the annual capacity growth rate of mental health services or leveraging digital technologies for triage and care coordination is projected to decrease youth mental health-related ED visits by 4.3% and 4.8% respectively. Implementation of mobile crisis response teams (consisting of a mental health nurse accompanying police or ambulance officers) is projected to reduce youth mental health-related ED visits by 10.2% by de-escalating some emergency situations and directly transferring selected individuals to community mental health centres. Other effective interventions include limiting re-presentations to ED by screening for suicide risk and following up with calls post-discharge (6.4% reduction), and limiting presentations of frequent users of ED by providing psychosocial education to families of people with schizophrenia (5.1% reduction). Finally, combining these five approaches is projected to reduce youth mental health-related ED presentations by 26.6% by the end of 2032. Conclusions: Policies to decrease youth mental health-related ED presentations should not be limited to increasing mental health care capacity, but also include structural reforms. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,BMC Psychiatry,24,1,,,10.1186/s12888-024-06066-7,,#198,Vacher 2024,,
“Being in the system is really difficult and…I wouldn't wish it on anybody.” Trauma and the public sector system of care for youth,"Masuda, T.; Helm, S.","Youth involved in public sector services for substance use and other forms of mental health, juvenile justice, foster care, or homelessness report higher rates of trauma compared to the general youth population. We interviewed 26 youth, ages 14–21, with lived experience in public systems of care for the purpose of a state-contracted needs assessment evaluation. Qualitative analysis of these data indicated trauma occurs sequentially vis-à-vis the system of care. Participants experienced family adversity and a lack of social support, which has been defined as pre-system trauma. Because of this pre-system trauma, youth were referred to the public sector system of care. Rather than resolving trauma, system involvement exacerbated existing trauma and introduced new forms of trauma, defined as system-based trauma. Existing policies and practice address pre-system trauma, though there is room for improvement for both pre-system and system-based trauma. The field has yet to reckon fully with system-based trauma and this may be the next transformation for public sector youth services. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Child. Youth Serv.

A Comparative Analysis of Transitional and Permanent Supportive Housing Through the Lens of Young Adult Residents,"Semborski, S.; Petry, L.; Henwood, B.","Supportive housing (SH), largely consisting of Transitional Living Programs (TLPs) and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), is the primarly intervention being applied to the one-in-ten young adults that experience homelessness in the United States each year. To date, efforts to understand the perception of these programs among young adult tenants have focused singularly on TLPs or PSH. The current qualitative study builds upon previous evidence through a comparative analysis of young adult perceptions of TLPs and PSH and examines the the physical, social, and service environments associated with each program. Results suggest six themes, including three themes focused on factors associated with location, common to both TLPs and PSH: desired proximity to friends, family, and amenities; wanted distance from negative influences; and increased ability to assimilate. Three additional themes focused on the environment internal to the housing program that differentiated the models: shared space with roommates, the service environment and relationships with SH staff, and the moving on process. Findings indicate that location is an important but complex element of the housing environment for all young SH tenants with both positive and negative factors. Within the housing environment, more TLP residents had roommates and spoke of utilizing the services associated with their housing, but discussed feeling less prepared for life after SH. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Aggressive behaviors in first-episode psychosis: Distinction between the premorbid phase and the onset of psychosis,"Sicotte, R.; D'Andrea, G.; Dumais, A.; Crocker, A.G.; Villeneuve, M.; Brochu, E.; Abdel-Baki, A.","Background: There is a well-established, although complex, association between aggression and psychosis, particularly in the early stages of illness. Some persons display aggressive behaviors even prior to psychosis onset. However, factors associated with aggressive behaviors prior to and at first-episode psychosis (FEP) onset remain underdocumented. Aims: The objective is two-fold: 1) to describe the prevalence of verbal and physical aggression occurring during the premorbid phase and at FEP onset; 2) distinguish the factors associated with aggressive behaviors during these two periods. Method: Data on aggressive behaviors and factors potentially associated therewith were collected through research interviews and chart reviews among 567 persons with FEP admitted to two early intervention services in Montreal, Canada. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with aggressive behaviors in both periods. Results: In the premorbid phase, 46.1 % (n = 257/558) of patients presented aggression (verbal: 35.9 %; towards objects: 24.2 %; against others: 27.9 %). At FEP, 18.1 % (n = 101/558) presented aggressive behaviors (verbal: 12.9 %; towards objects: 6.1 %; against others: 8.8 %). In the premorbid phase, lower education, prior justice involvement, cluster B personality traits/disorder and poorer functioning were associated with aggressive behaviors, while, at FEP, only prior homelessness was associated with aggression. Conclusions: Aggressive behaviors are frequent in patients with FEP, prior onset and at FEP. Premorbid aggressive behaviors seem to be associated with premorbid difficulties. Early detection of youth with psychosis and those at high risk of psychosis, particularly homeless youth, is necessary to provide access to early specialized interventions and possibly prevent aggressive behaviors and their consequences. © 2024",2024,,Schizophr.

"Perceptions from emerging adults with a history of homelessness on their experiences with housing, health and other support services","McDonald, K.; Palimaru, A.I.; Garvey, R.; D'Amico, E.J.; Tucker, J.S.","Homelessness is a significant public health problem in the U.S., where nearly 3.5 million emerging adults (ages 18–25) experience homelessness while unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. Emerging adults are a particularly vulnerable group, even without the added stress of homelessness. Being unhoused can exacerbate negative outcomes in wellbeing and functioning and also increase risky behaviors. These complex needs are important to consider for programs aimed at housing emerging adults with a history of homelessness. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 30 emerging adults who have experienced homelessness, this study explores a range of perspectives on challenges and opportunities for coordination of housing and social support services for emerging adults, particularly those that are perceived to contribute to housing stability. Overall, findings suggest a mix of positive and negative experiences with various approaches to case management among both stably and unstably housed participants, highlighting the overall importance of the case manager in the housing process experience. Results also indicate that stable housing may provide a platform for greater access to and utilization of physical health care resources. Important issues to be addressed in the future include perceived discrimination in service provision. These results offer policy implications, such as expanding age-related eligibility for support systems and increasing the consistency and timeliness of case management to improve the overall experience of trying to obtain and remain in stable housing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Child.

Mental health in society's margins: Poor n-3 PUFA intake and psychological well-being of homeless youth,"Orchard, T.S.; Dunn, S.B.; Andridge, R.; Rymut, S.M.; Slesnick, N.; Hatsu, I.E.","Dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFA (n-3 PUFA), particularly EPA and DHA, has been associated with psychological well-being, but little is known about the n-3 PUFA intake of homeless youth. The current study determined the association between depression and anxiety symptoms and n-3 PUFA intake and erythrocytes status in homeless youth. Totally, 114 homeless youth aged 18-24 years were recruited from a drop-in centre. n-3 PUFA dietary intake was assessed using an FFQ, and erythrocytes status was determined by gas chromatography (GC). Linear regression models were used to determine the relationship between psychological well-being and n-3 PUFA intake and status. The mean intakes of EPA and DHA for all participants (0·06 ± 0·13 g/d and 0·11 ± 0·24 g/d) were well below recommended levels, and mean erythrocytes EPA + DHA (n-3 index) in the cohort (2·42 %) was lower than reported for healthy, housed adolescents and those with clinical depression. There was no association of n-3 PUFA intake and erythrocytes status with either depression or anxiety. However, the relationships of depression with dietary EPA (P = 0·017) and DHA (P = 0·008), as well as erythrocytes DHA (P = 0·007) and n 3-index (P = 0·009), were significantly moderated by sex even after adjusting for confounders. Specifically, among females, as the intake and status of these n-3 PUFA decreased, depression increased. Our findings show poor dietary intake and low erythrocytes status of n-3 PUFA among homeless youth, which is associated with depressive symptoms among females.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Evaluating a Future-Oriented Positive Youth Development Intervention to Reduce Sexual Risk Among Highly Mobile Youth: Results and Challenges,"Drake, P.J.; Potter, S.C.; Clark, L.F.; Desai, M.; LaSalle-Castro, F.; Masters, T.; Ayyaluru, S.","Purpose: Youth experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness need tailored prevention programming to prevent unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. This study evaluated the efficacy of a small-group, future-oriented positive youth development (PYD) intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors. Method: Youth aged 14–19 (n = 483) experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness were recruited at youth-serving agencies and in alternative schools. Each cohort enrolled was randomized either to a 10-session, 5-week group future-oriented intervention to support them in adopting health-promoting behaviors such as using contraception, including condom use (n = 244) or to a no-treatment condition where they received usual services/schooling (n = 239). We assessed at baseline and 3-month and 9-month follow-up (1) vaginal intercourse without consistent contraception use, (2) vaginal and anal intercourse without consistent condom use, and (3) sexual risk behaviors, including current (last 3 months) effective contraception use by females who did not report current use at baseline. Results: There was no significant difference between treatment and control conditions for most outcomes. However, among females not currently using contraception at baseline, 34% in the treatment condition compared to 12.9% in the control condition reported using contraception in the 3 months before the 9-month survey, a statistically significant difference. Discussion: This sexual risk reduction intervention, grounded in PYD theory and tailored to address the needs of marginalized groups of youth, demonstrated efficacy at increasing contraceptive uptake among females. The need for PYD interventions that can be delivered in a variety of nontraditional school and service settings are discussed. © 2024 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2024,,J. Adolesc.

Prevalence of youth experiencing homelessness and its association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors: Findings from a population-based study,"Baiden, P.; LaBrenz, C.A.; Broni, M.N.; Baiden, J.F.; Adepoju, O.E.","Although various studies have examined factors associated with suicidal behaviors among youth, few studies have investigated the association between youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) using a large nationally representative sample. The objectives of this study were to investigate prevalence of YEH and its association with STBs. Data for this study came from the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. An analytic sample of 17,033 youth aged 14–18 (51.7 % male) was analyzed using binary logistic regression. Of the 17,033 youth examined, 3 % experienced homelessness during the past 30 days, 21.3 % experienced suicidal ideation, 17.3 % made a suicide plan, and 10.9 % attempted suicide during the past 12 months. Controlling for demographic characteristics and feeling sad or hopeless, YEH was associated with 2.48 times higher odds of experiencing suicidal ideation (AOR=2.48, p<.001), 2.46 times higher odds of making a suicide plan (AOR=2.46, p<.001), and 4.38 times higher odds of making a suicide attempt (AOR=4.38, p<.001). The findings of this study highlight the importance of identifying youth who are at risk of experiencing homelessness to ensure early interventions are put in place to prevent suicidal behaviors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2024,,Psychiatry Res.,334,,,,10.1016/j.psychres.2024.115823,,#212,Baiden 2024,,
Differences in Mental Health Between Female Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Youth with a Substance Use Disorder Who Are Experiencing Homelessness,"Mallory, A.B.; Martin, J.K.; Fitzpatrick, M.M.; Yilmazer, T.; Chavez, L.; Slesnick, N.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine differences in mental health outcomes of two groups within youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and who have a substance use disorder (SUD): sexual minority (SM) and heterosexual females. Methods: This study used baseline data from four randomized clinical trials of substance use interventions for YEH with a SUD to examine differences in depression and suicidality between SM and heterosexual female youth. Participants were between 12 and 24 years of age. Meta-analytic methods were used to aggregate data across studies to estimate differences in mental health. Results: Results indicated that female SM-YEH had higher depression symptoms (Hedge’s g [g]=0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.39), higher risk of a history of suicide behavior (risk ratio = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.17-2.27), and a greater number of suicide behaviors (g = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.09-0.54) compared to their heterosexual peers. These effect sizes were not moderated by age. Conclusion: Female SM-YEH had elevated levels of depression and suicidality compared to their heterosexual peers. The findings of this study align with research on mental health disparities between SM and heterosexual youth generally, which underscores the unique struggles and risks associated with identifying as a female SM-YEH with a SUD.

Interventions for pregnant youth and young mothers experiencing homelessness: A systematic review,"Lakrouf, R.; Roy, L.; Arbaud, C.; Stich, C.","Pregnant youth and young mothers facing housing instability or homelessness encounter unique challenges that result in adverse health, educational, and employment consequences for both them and their children. This systematic review aimed to consolidate the available evidence on effective and promising interventions to prevent homelessness amongst youth who are pregnant or young mothers with children under 6 years old and assist those facing homelessness. This review encompassed 10 studies that revolved around two primary themes: housing and supportive services, such as case management (n = 6), and parental services, including childcare provision or parenting classes (n = 4). We found that housing strategies incorporating counselling and case management notably enhanced participants' substance use patterns, mental health, healthcare access, and employment trajectories. Comparatively, housing services without supportive services did not lead to improvements within the participants. Parental services such as family home visits significantly reduced homelessness for participating families. School-based programs that offer childcare and supportive services improved maternal academic outcomes, reduced the incidence of subsequent pregnancies, and fostered positive parenting practices. Mobile technology also appeared promising in enhancing the emotional and behavioural capabilities of the youth. In conclusion, interventions targeting young expectant individuals and mothers, whether at risk or already experiencing homelessness, primarily emphasize housing combined with supportive services and parenting assistance. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Child.

"Statewide aftercare services program for youth transitioning from foster care: Five-year trends in participation, services, and participant characteristics","Weems, C.F.; Melby, J.N.; Behrer, C.; Wolfe, D.; Scozzafava, M.D.","Research shows that youth who leave foster care to live independently are often at risk of homelessness, less education, unemployment/poverty, and mental health issues. There are a number of reasons for this increased risk. A variety of aftercare services for youth leaving foster care are designed to help address these risks. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in participation and understand the experiences of youth transitioning from foster care who were involved in the Iowa Aftercare Services Program. We examine trends in participation, services received, participant reports of service satisfaction, as well as employment and educational data at entry and exit over the past five years. We also examine trends in adverse life experiences and mental health characteristics. This is a secondary analysis of Iowa Aftercare Services program evaluation data, which includes survey data on participant reports of service satisfaction, as well as employment and educational data at entry and exit. The results suggest that the program serves a large portion of youth exiting foster care and is associated with high rates of satisfaction with the services, as well as high self-sufficiency ratings in housing, finances, and relationships. Moreover, youth rates of employment and education were greater when exiting the program than at study entry. We found variation in the rates of services received across the types of supports and found high rates of mental health and adverse life experiences among the participants. The findings from this study add to the literature, suggesting the benefit of statewide aftercare services and opportunities for enhancing programs for foster care youth. Specifically, mental health services might be augmented for this population with specific assessment targets, opportunities to facilitate recruitment of males, and the need to identify and reduce potential barriers to youth accessing available services. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Child.

Researchers collected data using a semi-structured interview guide and coded data following thematic analysis methods. Results: Clinicians described their ARC training and subsequent readiness to deliver ARC-informed services and provided feedback on how training could be improved. When reflecting on their use of ARC, they described the framework as inclusive, shared challenges and solutions to applying ARC in their work, and detailed how they promote attachment, regulation, and competency with YEH using this model.

The Hope and Goals of Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Holbrook, N.M.; Feldman, D.B.; Budescu, M.; Cheang, C.I.","This study investigates the relationship between goal characteristics and hope in emerging adults experiencing homelessness. Employing Hope Theory as a framework, we surveyed 100 emerging adults experiencing homelessness, ages 18–29 (M = 21.95), asking them to nominate three goals they were currently pursuing, rate those goals on personal importance, and complete measures of dispositional and goal-specific hope. Goals were coded for domains and characteristics. Goals most commonly fell into the domains of basic needs (64%), career (56%), and academics (27%). Multilevel modeling shows that one coded goal characteristic—difficulty—was associated with goal-specific hope. Additionally, self-rated goal importance was associated with greater goal-specific hope. Consistent with Hope Theory, individuals with higher dispositional hope had more goal-specific hope. These results contrast with research in college students, finding both that different goal domains predominated and different characteristics were associated with hope. This suggests that context matters when characterizing individuals’ goals and hope. © 2024 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood and SAGE Publishing.",2024,,Emerg.

Associations of Homelessness With Primary Care and Acute Care Utilization Among Medicaid-Enrolled Youth,"Yue, D.; Chuang, E.; Zhou, W.; Essien, E.A.; Lee, Y.; O’Masta, B.; Pourat, N.","Background: Youth comprise one-third of the US homeless population. However, little is known about how homelessness affects health care utilization. Objective: Examine associations of homelessness with hospitalization, primary care, and ED visits, varying by race/ethnicity, among Medicaid-enrolled youth. Research Design: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using California Medicaid claims data on youth beneficiaries with complex needs. We examined the number of hospitalizations, preventable and nonpreventable ED, and primary care visits using a multivariate regression. We further explored the differential associations by race/ethnicity. Results: Approximately 17% of our sampled youth experienced homelessness in 2018 (N = 90,202). Compared with their housed counterparts, youth experiencing homelessness had a 1.9 percentage point (pp) higher likelihood of frequent ED visits (95% CI: 1.7–2.2) but a 2.9 pp lower probability of any primary care visits (95% CI: -3.9 to -1.9). Homelessness was associated with 221 more ED visits (95% CI: 182–260), 100 more preventable ED visits (95% CI: 84–116), 19.9 more hospitalizations (95% CI: 12–27), but 56 fewer primary care visits (95% CI: -104 to -7), per 1000 youth. The associations of homelessness with total ED visits, preventable ED visits, and needed and nonpreventable ED visits were all higher among Whites and, particularly, Blacks than for Hispanics and Asians. Conclusions: Medicaid-enrolled youth who experienced homelessness had more overall ED, preventable ED, and hospital visits, but fewer primary care visits than their housed peers. Our results suggest promoting primary care use should be considered among strategies to improve health and reduce costs. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",2024,,Med.

Objective: The objective of this study was to define characteristics of the unhoused youth population and their utilization of healthcare to inform programs to meet their needs. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the College of Charleston's YOUth Count survey was conducted, focusing on health-related characteristics, challenges, healthcare utilization, and SDoH of youth aged 18 to 25 experiencing homelessness in Charleston, SC. Results: Almost three-quarters of respondents (74.6%) reported mental health challenges and 35% reported physical health challenges. A significantly higher proportion of those who engaged in survival sex were LGBTQ+. More than half (68.4%) visited the emergency department (ED) and 29.3% were admitted to the hospital in the past 12 months.

Suicide prevention for substance using youth experiencing homelessness: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Slesnick, N.; Brakenhoff, B.; Chavez, L.J.; Cuthbertson, C.L.; Famelia, R.; Feng, X.; Ford, J.; Holowacz, E.; Jaderlund, S.; Kelleher, K.; Luthy, E.; Mallory, A.M.; Pizzulo, A.; Slesnick, T.D.; Yilmazer, T.","Background: While research on substance using youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective prevention interventions for these youth. Suicide is the leading cause of death among YEH and most youth do not access services that may be available to them. Therefore, this study seeks to address this gap in the research literature with the goal to identify an effective suicide prevention intervention that can be readily adopted by communities that serve these youth. Methods: Three hundred (N = 300) YEH with recent substance use and suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt will be recruited from the streets as well as a drop-in center serving YEH. After the baseline assessment, all youth will be randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Services as Usual (SAU) (N = 150) or to SAU alone (N = 150). SAU includes outreach, advocacy, and service linkage whereas YEH who receive CTSP will also receive ten CTSP sessions and an optional nine booster sessions. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline. Theoretically derived mediators (e.g., cognitive distortions) will be tested to shed light on mechanisms associated with change, and the moderating effects of sex, race, sexual orientation, and baseline service connection will be examined. In order to ease future dissemination of the intervention to agencies serving YEH, we will rigorously assess acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, and cost associated with the delivery of our intervention approach using a mixed-methods approach. Discussion: This study adds to a very small number of clinical trials seeking to prevent lethal suicide among a very high-risk group by addressing suicidal ideation directly rather than underlying conditions. It is hypothesized that youth receiving CTSP + SAU will show greater reductions in suicidal ideation (primary outcome), substance use, and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) over time compared to SAU alone, as well as improved risk and protective factors.

"Neglected tropical disease meets neglected community: Street children’s susceptibility to scabies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Zewude, B.; Tadele, G.; Davey, G.","Scabies is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) with high prevalence rate in resource-limited settings. Though street children are susceptible because of lack of sanitation and contact with vectors, few attempts have been made to identify the lived experience of street children with scabies in the global south. This study explored perceived susceptibility to scabies and related lived experiences of street children in Addis Ababa. Using in-depth interviews, we collected qualitative data from selected children of the street to identify their understanding of the causes of scabies, their experiences of managing the condition, and their health-seeking behavior. Informants were recruited to include maximum variation in terms of age, sex, and experience of infestation. The study showed that scabies was common among street children and that the infestation has physical, psychological and social impacts. Study participants believed that scabies had its origin in their living conditions (including poor environmental sanitation and lack of personal hygiene), with lice playing a significant role as vectors of transmission. The informants reported visiting modern healthcare facilities, traditional healers and self-care in response to infestation. By uncovering the embodied experience of a stigmatized skin NTD in a neglected community in the global south, this study contributes to combating neglect and addressing health disparities. Having identified living conditions as the major factor contributing to susceptibility, efforts need to be exerted to change street children’s living situations and other structural conditions through reunification with their families or other communities, reintegration and other exit strategies. © 2024 Zewude et al.",2024,,PLoS.

This exploratory qualitative research study through a descriptive phenomenological lens delves into the resilience of homeless Filipino youths (N = 10) in Tacloban City, Philippines, during the pandemic, examining their ability to adapt and thrive amidst the crisis toward their relative well-being. Results showed that homeless youths have complex and unaddressed needs and challenges, such as longing for parental love, suffering from social discrimination and mental stress, receiving no government services, and thinking and feeling of suicide. Nonetheless, homeless youths exhibited remarkable resilience, employing differentiated or collective coping mechanisms like developing and strengthening friendship and family relations while believing in God to navigate the pandemic’s disruptions and thus meet resolutions across the tensions surrounding resilience. The paper contributes to developing informed policies and programs tailored to the immediate and long-term needs of homeless youths. Future research may conduct follow-up or longitudinal studies on the dynamics of homelessness and the resilience of the same or related social groups in post-pandemic while transitioning into middle adulthood and beyond. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,J.

"A step of faith: The experiences of street children in search of survival in Nakuru City, Kenya and its implications on policy","Ongowo, E.O.; Ngetich, K.; Murenga, H.","Literature on street children has documented the life of street children in four phases: at home, on the streets, in child care institutions and post institutionalization. However, the journey to the streets has not received sufficient scholarly examination. This article documents street children's experiences in search of survival in Nakuru City, Kenya. The study adopted a qualitative research design with Nakuru City being purposively selected as an emerging city and a fourth city in Kenya with the highest number of street children. Data was collected from 14 purposively street children through in-depth interviews and analysed thematically. The study demonstrates unique experiences of the journey to the streets and recommends policy development that guarantee survival and protection rights. We conclude that the desire for survival generates resilience in children that powers them through the journey to the streets. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2024,,Child Fam. Soc.

"The Global Prevalence of Non-suicidal Self-injury, Suicide Behaviors, and Associated Risk Factors Among Runaway and Homeless Youth: A Meta-analysis","Armoon, B.; Mohammadi, R.; Griffiths, M.D.","A meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicide behaviors (including ideation, attempts), and associated risk factors among runaway and homeless youth (RHY). The databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies published from January 1995 to May 2023. Initially, 8465 papers were screened, resulting in 69 included studies. The results showed that among RHY, lifetime prevalence rates were 42% for NSSI, 38% for suicidal ideation, and 27% for suicide attempts. Lifetime prevalence of NSSI and suicide behaviors was higher among adolescent minors (aged 12–17 years) compared to young adults (aged 18–24 years). Also, NSSI and suicide behaviors were associated with having a childhood history of physical and sexual abuse. Developing an impactful community-based suicide prevention campaign tailored for RHY appears warranted. Peer groups and mentorship programs would provide invaluable support for young individuals, as supportive friendships protect against NSSI. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Community Ment.

Interdisciplinary Approaches to LGBTQ+ Inclusion in Education: A Qualitative Study from Slovenia,"Ferbežar, N.; Štefanec, V.; Gavriloski Tretjak, M.; Kopinič, A.","Educational institutions are not always adequately equipped to deal independently with the challenges that LGBTQ+ students experience during their studies, necessitating interdisciplinary approaches. The aim of our study was to identify needs and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration aimed at addressing issues related to the well-being of LGBTQ+ youth in education. In our qualitative study, we conducted interviews with 27 LGBTQ+ people between the ages of 17 and 41 who are or have been part of the Slovenian education system at some point in their lives. We identified four possible areas where educational institutions have the potential to improve the well-being of LGBTQ+ youth through interdisciplinary interventions: educational climate and representation of LGBTQ+ people, mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention, inclusive sex education, and homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth. We see opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between schools and mental health professionals, LGBTQ+ specific non-governmental organizations (NGOs), NGOs addressing LGBTQ+ youth homelessness, and health centers and services. The adversities experienced by LGBTQ+ youth in education are often closely intertwined with their everyday lives, intersectional and thus very complex. The solutions to overcome these challenges should therefore be systemic, pragmatic, and interdisciplinary. For comprehensive discussions on interdisciplinary interventions in education, future studies should also consider the perspectives of educators and other relevant stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,J.

Homeless youth-led activism and direct action: Lessons from a participatory research project in Tio'tia:ke/Montréal,"Malenfant, J.; Watchorn, M.; Nichols, N.","This article explores the involvement of youth with lived experience (LE) in activism and research aimed at addressing youth homelessness in Canada. Based within a youth-participatory action research project in Tio'tiá:ke/Montréal, Canada, we reflect on how young people described their own activist organising, as well as the practical ways we may harness actions that homelessness youth are already doing to create communities and solidarity. The authors are members of Youth Action Research Revolution (YARR), a research team primarily made up of youth with LE of homelessness. We position the analysis at an intersection of our own experiences and 63 interviews with youth aged 16–29 conducted by YARR from 2018 to 2021. Conceiving of participatory, youth-led research as a form of direct action we outline lessons learned from our own research and LE. Young people within our team and participants in YARR's research shared critiques of State systems while outlining the work that they undertook with their peers to act on issues of housing precarity, often eschewing activism aimed at State processes or institutional reform in favour of direct action. This article proposes a mode of fostering youth-led, socially just change around homelessness—one that shifts conversations from inclusion to solidarity, and recognises the radical potential of research by-and-for young people. The authors conclude that research and advocacy on homelessness is always inherently political for young people with LE, and that harnessing the direct action that youth already do to survive is not only a socially just form of mobilising, but can contribute to broader activism towards housing justice. © 2023 The Authors.

Demographics of Youth With Newly Diagnosed Acute/Recent HIV Infection in Adolescent Trials Network 147: Early Treatment of Acute HIV Infection,"Kerin, T.; Cortado, R.; Paiola, S.G.; Ceballos, J.; Abdalian, S.E.; Flynn, R.; Bolan, R.; Adebambo, Y.V.; Sim, M.S.; Swendeman, D.; Ocasio, M.A.; Fournier, J.; Ank, B.; Bryson, Y.; Nielsen-Saines, K.","Purpose: Gay, bisexual, and other cisgender men who have sex with men, and racial minority youth are at elevated risk of acquiring HIV infection. The Adolescent Trials Network 147 recruited youth with acute/recent HIV-infection for early antiretroviral treatment. The cohort make-up is described here. Methods: Treatment-naïve, recently identified HIV + youth, aged 12–24 years, from Los Angeles and New Orleans were recruited from community centers, clinics, social media, and a high-risk seronegative cohort (n = 1,727, the Adolescent Trials Network 149) using point-of-care assays. Acute HIV infection was determined by Fiebig staging. HIV RNA viral load (VL) and CD4 cell counts, along with demographic and behavioral data were assessed at enrollment. Results: Between July 2017 and July 2021, 103 newly diagnosed youth were enrolled, initiating antiretroviral treatment within a week. Mean age was 20.8 years (standard deviation: 2.4); 90.3% identified as cis male, 83.5% were single or in casual relationships, 71.8% were gay, bisexual, and other cisgender men who have sex with men; 60.2% were Black. One-fourth (24.3%) reported homelessness ever; 10.7% within last 4 months. At enrollment, median plasma VL was 37,313 HIV RNA copies/ml (interquartile range: 5,849–126,162) and median CD4 count 445.5 cells/mm3 (interquartile range: 357–613). 40% of youth reported acute retroviral symptoms before or at enrollment. Acutely infected, seroconverting youth had the highest VL. Sexually transmitted coinfections were present at enrollment in 56% of the cohort, with syphilis being most frequent (39%). Discussion: Early identification and treatment of HIV can increase positive HIV outcomes. A high sexually transmitted infection burden was present in recently HIV-infected youth. Acute retroviral symptoms were not reported by most participants, demonstrating that broad universal HIV screening is needed for identification of recent infection in youth. © 2023 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2024,,J.

"Adverse childhood experiences, mothers and homelessness: a narrative review and recommendations","Kohler, A.; Pylypchuk, N.; Reisdorfer, E.","Homelessness is a complex and pervasive worldwide social crisis that profoundly affects a diverse range of individuals and communities. Adverse childhood events (ACEs) are traumatic events that can lead to significant negative effects during adulthood, including homelessness. In women who are mothers, the pathways to loss of housing include, but are not limited to: a history of ACEs, weak social networks, sexual violence, and intimate partner violence. This narrative review of the literature aimed at examining the evidence of adverse childhood experiences and homelessness in adult women who are mothers and to providing recommendations for practice. Across the eight articles included and analyzed, six common themes emerged: family fragmentation, out-of-family placement, abuse, learned substance abuse, a lack of formal and informal education, and normalization and internalization of ACEs. The results showed that children who experience ACEs and become mothers in adulthood might have increased chances of becoming homeless and repeating an intergenerational cycle of trauma onto their children. © 2024 The Author(s).

Sleep and mental health among youth experiencing homelessness: A retrospective pilot diary study,"Budescu, M.; Reid, A.; Sisselman-Borgia, A.; Holbrook, N.; Valera, D.; Torino, G.C.","Objectives: The goal of this study was to describe the nightly sleep conditions of youth experiencing homelessness, and examine the association between sleep and mental health, both cross-sectionally and using diary data. Methods: n = 147 youth (ages 16-24) experiencing homelessness completed a baseline survey assessing self-reported sleep and depressive and anxious symptoms. A subsample of n = 49 completed a follow-up 7-day diary study measuring nightly sleep conditions and daily depressive and somatic symptoms. Results: According to baseline data, the majority of the sample (71%) reported sleeping less than 7 hours per night on average, and feeling like they did not get adequate sleep, especially among youth identifying as LGBTQ. In a qualitative follow-up question, the plurality attributed poor sleep to mental health woes. Cross-sectionally, youth with lower levels of self-reported sleep quality (more daytime fatigue and insomnia) reported higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms. The diary data indicated that the most common nightly complaints among shelter utilizers are lack of privacy, noise, and uncomfortable temperatures. Multilevel models suggest that poor sleep conditions predicted higher levels of somatic symptoms the following day, after controlling for baseline levels of depressive and anxious symptoms. Conclusions: This study highlights the role environmental context plays in sleep health and its subsequent impacts. Individuals experiencing homelessness lack autonomy over their sleeping environments, and thus cannot make adjustments such as reducing disruptions such as noise, temperature, and light. Importantly, these less-than-ideal sleeping conditions contribute to pre-existing health disparities and may have long-term implications. © 2023 National Sleep Foundation",2024,,Sleep Health,10,1,54-59,,10.1016/j.sleh.2023.10.003,,#250,Budescu 2024,,
Trajectories of homelessness and association with mental health and substance use disorders among young people transitioning from out-of-home care in Australia,"Chikwava, F.; Cordier, R.; Ferrante, A.; O'Donnell, M.; Pakpahan, E.","Background: Researchers have examined sub-groups that may exist among young people transitioning from out-of-home care (OHC) using various theoretical models. However, this population group has not been examined for trajectories of homelessness risk. Objectives: To examine whether different subtypes of homelessness risk exist among young people transitioning from care and whether these trajectories of homelessness are associated with mental health and substance use disorders. Participants and setting: A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted from a population of 1018 young people (aged 15–18 years) who transitioned from out-of-home in 2013 to 2014 in the state of Victoria, Australia, with follow-up to 2018. Methods: Latent Class Growth Analysis was conducted using linked data from homelessness data collections, child protection, mental health information systems, alcohol and drug use, and youth justice information systems. Results: Three sub-groups of young people were identified. The ‘moving on’ group (88 %) had the lowest levels of homelessness, with the slope of this trajectory remaining almost stable. The ‘survivors’ (7 %) group started off with a high risk of homelessness, followed by a sharp decrease in homelessness risk over time. The ‘complex’ (5 %) group started off with a low risk of homelessness but faced sharp increases in the risk of homelessness over time. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that subgroups of young people transitioning from care exist with distinct longitudinal trajectories of homelessness, and these classes are associated with different risk factors. Early intervention and different approaches to tackling homelessness should be considered for these three distinct groups before transitioning from care and during the first few years after leaving care. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Child Abuse Negl.,149,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.106643,,#252,Chikwava 2024,,
Intersectional Disparities in Runaway and Thrownaway Experiences Among Youth by Sexual Minority Status and Race/Ethnicity,"Han, B.","Introduction: It is well-documented that sexual minority youth are at a higher risk of experiencing being thrown away and running away from their parental home, the two main pathways to youth homelessness. These challenges are often related to family rejection and strained child-parent relationships. However, little knowledge exists of how sexual minority status intersect with race/ethnicity in this context. Methods: The study utilized data from Wave III (2001–2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) (1994–2018) with a sample size of 14,181 survey participants to examine the effects of sexual minority status and race/ethnicity on the experience of youth being ordered to move out and running away from one’s parental home. Results: A series of regression analyses revealed that sexual minority youth were more likely to experience being thrown away and running away from their parental home. Furthermore, the findings showed significant intersectional disparities from sexual minority status and Black race in experiences of being thrown away and running away even after controlling for various sociodemographic, family circumstances, and other risk factors. Black sexual minority youth faced heightened risks of parental home displacement, indicating increased vulnerability within sexual minority youth. Conclusions: The study provides the first large-scale, nationally representative population-based evidence for the unique risk that Black sexual minority youth are facing with respect to the two pathways to youth homelessness. Policy Implications: Families with sexual minority youth and youth experiencing homelessness may benefit from racially/ethnically specific and sexuality-specific interventions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Sex.

Homes of substance: Drugs and the making of home/lessness for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth,"Goodyear, T.; Jenkins, E.; Fast, D.; Oliffe, J.L.; Kia, H.; Katriana, I.; Knight, R.","Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual minority (2S/LGBTQ+) youth between the ages of 14 and 29 experience inequities in homelessness and substance use. Research in this area has explored substance use as a determinant of homelessness and/or as a coping mechanism, yet far less attention has been directed to the potentially generative role of drugs in this marginalizing context. This community-based photovoice study leverages data from 61 semi-structured interviews with 32 2S/LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and unstable housing to examine how drugs shape their practices and contexts of homemaking. Analysis followed a reflexive thematic approach and was informed theoretically by perspectives on home- and place-making, a momentum-stagnation analytical frame, and a narcofeminist ethics of care. This framing centred attention on the possibilities of what drugs can do for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth in terms of shaping selves, homes, and worlds while homeless. We inductively derived three themes: (i) chasing comforts, (ii) striking down stagnation, and (iii) producing precarity. 2S/LGBTQ+ youth consumed substances in chasing comforts including warmth, relief, and a sense of clarity and being more at ease within the context of homelessness and social and material inequity. Their substance use was also a means for striking down stagnation and engendering momentum as they worked to carve out better homes and futures for themselves Youth frequently drew attention to the temporality and limits of these benefits, however, cautioning that drugs could also turn to producing new forms of precarity that limited what they expected and experienced as possible with respect to their homemaking projects. Findings highlight the generative potential of drugs in the making of home/lessness and provide critical direction for policy and service delivery, including for supports to further consider and attend to the social contexts, meanings, and effects of 2S/LGBTQ+ youths’ substance use in connection with homelessness. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Soc.

Assessment of malnutrition using Z-scores and Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure among street children in Delhi,,"Background: Street children are poverty-stricken and have insufficient money to meet their daily nutritional requirements. They do not have a proper place to sleep and defecate. They sleep at traffic signals, in religious places, and on footpaths. This exposes them to pollution, dirt, and other pathogens. Objectives: This study aimed to measure the nutritional status of street children in Delhi using Z-scores and Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF). Methods: Anthropometric measurements are direct methods of measuring the nutritional status of humans. Anthropometric indicators such as underweight (weight-for-age), stunting (height-for-age) and BMI/wasting (weight-for-height) are used to measure the nutritional status of street children. Z-scores and CIAF are calculated for street children based on the WHO 2009 reference. Results: According to Z-scores, stunting (56%) is the most common anthropometric failure among street children followed by underweight (31%) and wasting (19%). According to the CIAF, 63% of street children are malnourished, where stunting (37%) is the highest single burden of anthropometric failure, followed by wasting (3%) and underweight (1%); children suffering from the double burden of anthropometric failure are 9%, and children suffering from the triple burden of anthropometric failure (i.e., wasting, stunting, and underweight) are 13%. Conclusion: A high incidence of stunting points to poor quality of food and suggests prolonged nutrition deficiency among street children. The Z-score or conventional measures of anthropometry underestimate the total burden of malnutrition among street children, while CIAF provides an estimation of children with single-burden, double-burden, and triple-burden malnutrition or total burden of malnutrition. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2024,,Nutrition,125,,,,10.1016/j.nut.2024.112487,,#261,,,
Body mapping as a site to negotiate eating struggles and food insecurity for street-involved and homeless youth,"Hyland, C.E.; Lee, E.","Inspired by critical trauma and embodiment theories, this study aims to illustrate how an arts-based approach such as body mapping assists in exploring the lived experiences of youth, potentially serving as a trauma-informed approach. This qualitative study collaborated with street-involved and homeless youth (SIHY) who have eating struggles while living in situations of food insecurity and other forms of oppression. Eleven participants partook in three individual face-to-face interview sessions and one arts-based body map activity, respectively, at a local SIHY resource centre in a metropolitan city in Canada. Guided by Interpretative Phenomenological Approach (IPA), our findings illustrated how body mapping (1) enabled a deepened understanding of SIHY’s eating struggles as both a form of suffering and an embodied means of coping with food insecurity and other systemic and relational trauma(s); (2) provided a transformative experience leading to greater self-compassion and healing; and (3) served as a trauma-informed method that fostered choice and validation. We attest that, as a creative and supportive clinical and research tool, body mapping taps into the unspoken, expressive, embodied, and somatic aspects of eating struggles, food insecurity, poverty, and other forms of oppression deepening knowledge and informing social work research and practice. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Qual.

"Precarity, Hope and Despair in Nadia Fall's Home","Gültekin, H.","This paper examines Nadia Fall's Home (2013), which delves into youth homelessness in London against the backdrop of the UK government's austerity measures. These measures included budget reductions in education, health, social security, and culture, along with the introduction of 'Universal Credit', a new benefit system. Crafted by Nadia Fall, Home offers a paradoxical panorama that draws attention to resilience and despair, sociability and loneliness in an old building housing over 200 young residents. Known for directing plays such as Three Sisters, The Suicide, Dara, and Chewing Gum Dreams at the National Theatre, Nadia Fall has collaborated with major theatre companies including the Bush Theatre, Chichester, and Lyric Hammersmith. Fall, renowned for her directing prowess, has demonstrated her success as a playwright with Home, which she produced based on over thirty hours of interviews with homeless individuals. This research situates Nadia Fall's play Home within its historical backdrop, seeking to comprehend the historical factors influencing the political circumstances depicted in the play. It aims to grasp the characters' social class placement by applying Guy Standing's concept of the precariat. The paper scrutinizes how Home employs hope and despair, along with a utopian socio-economic background, to highlight the unbearable nature of precariousness and homelessness. Additionally, the paper explores the utopian aspiration for an alternative way of life. © 2024 Cyprus International University.

Transition from Foster Care: A Cross Sectional Comparison of Youth Outcomes Twenty Years Apart,"Reilly, T.; Schlinkert, D.","Young adults aging out of the foster care system have received a good deal of attention over the years from policymakers, child welfare practitioners and researchers. Despite these efforts, youth aging out of the foster care system continue to have well-documented challenges when transitioning to adulthood. In this cross-sectional comparative study, we assess the outcomes of emancipated youth after the initiation of an extended after care program and compare the results with the outcomes drawn from a prior study conducted twenty years earlier. Overall, young adults in the 2021 study fared significantly better than their 2001 counterparts. They had increased positive health outcomes, were more financially secure, had a notable decline in involvement with law enforcement, were engaged in less illegal activity, had better educational outcomes, fewer job terminations, were experiencing less homelessness, were less likely to be married, and had fewer pregnancies and children than youth in the 2001 study.

Factors Associated With Antiretroviral Adherence Among Youth Living With HIV,"Arnold, E.M.; Kamal, S.; Rotheram-Borus, M.J.; Bridges, S.K.; Gertsch, W.; Norwood, P.; Swendeman, D.","Background: Youth living with HIV (YLH) have an increased risk for psychosocial stressors that can affect their antiretroviral (ARV) adherence. We examined factors associated with selfreported ARV adherence among YLH ages 12-24 years old. Setting: YLH (N = 147) were recruited in Los Angeles, CA, and New Orleans, LA from 2017 to 2020. Methods: YLH whose self-reported recent (30 days) ARV adherence was ""excellent""or ""very good""were compared with nonadherent YLH on sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Participants were predominantly male (88%), and 81% identified as gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or other. The mean duration on ARV was 27 months (range 0-237 months). Most YLH (71.2%) self-reported being adherent, and 79% of those who selfreported adherence were also virally suppressed (<200 copies/mL). Multivariate analysis indicated being adherent was significantly associated with white race [aOR = 8.07, confidence intervals (CI): 1.45 to 74.0], Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity [aOR = 3.57, CI: 1.16 to 12.80], more social support [aOR = 1.11, CI: 1.05 to 1.18], and being on ARV for a shorter duration [aOR = 0.99, CI: 0.97 to 0.99]. Mental health symptoms, substance use, age, and history of homelessness or incarceration were unrelated to adherence. Conclusions: Enhancing efforts to provide support for adherence to non-white youth, and those with limited social support and who have been on ARV treatment longer, may help increase viral suppression among YLH.

2S/LGBTQ+ youth substance use and pathways to homelessness: A photovoice study,"Goodyear, T.; Jenkins, E.; Oliffe, J.L.; Fast, D.; Kia, H.; Knight, R.","Background: Studies have posited that substance use is associated with, or contributes to, homelessness for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth. However, interconnections between these issues are poorly articulated. Methods: This community-based photovoice study describes the narratives used by 2S/LGBTQ+ youth about how substance use featured in their pathways to homelessness. Employing constructionist narrative analysis, two storylines were inductively derived from participant-produced photographs and photovoice interviews with 32 2S/LGBTQ+ youth in Vancouver, Canada. Results: Taking refuge narratives centered on 2S/LGBTQ+ youths’ use of substances to cope with intersecting hardships and minority stressors they had faced growing up, and when transitioning to homelessness. From playing into precarity narratives focused on the shifting possibilities and tensions of what sexualized crystal methamphetamine use can surface for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth in terms of facilitating connection and release and simultaneously invoking discomforts, including eviction from their family home. Conclusions: These narratives can usefully be anticipated and recognized to better understand and address the social contexts in which 2S/LGBTQ+ youth experience substance use and associated harms, especially homelessness. They affirm the need for tailored supports for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth who use drugs in the lead-up to and after becoming homeless, including the provision of care that better recognizes youths’ pursuits of becoming and belonging in the context of marginalization, and that takes a harm reduction approach to addressing the role of substance use in these pursuits. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Int.

"Where are the links? Using a causal loop diagram to assess interactions in healthcare coordination for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Canada","Hudani, A.; Long, J.; Labonté, R.; Yaya, S.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) suffer from poorer physical and mental health outcomes than stably housed youth. Additionally, YEH are forced to navigate fragmented health and social service systems on their own, where they often get lost between systems when transitioning or post-discharge. Inevitably, YEH require support with health system navigation and healthcare coordination. The aim of this study is to understand interactions within and between the emergency youth shelter (EYS) and health systems that affect healthcare coordination for YEH in Toronto, Canada, and how these interactions can be targeted to improve healthcare coordination for YEH. Methods: This study is part of a larger qualitative case study informed by the framework for transformative systems change. To understand interactions in healthcare coordination for YEH within and between the EYS and health systems, we developed a causal loop diagram (CLD) using in-depth interview data from 24 key informants at various levels of both systems. Open and focused codes developed during analysis using Charmaz’s constructivist grounded theory methodology were re-analysed to identify key variables, and links between them to create the CLD. The CLD was then validated by six stakeholders through a stakeholder forum. Results: The CLD illustrates six balancing and one reinforcing feedback loop in current healthcare coordination efforts within the EYS and health systems, respectively. Increasing EYS funding, building human resource capacity, strengthening inter and intra-systemic communication channels, and establishing strategic partnerships and formal referral pathways were identified among several other variables to be targeted to spiral positive change in healthcare coordination for YEH both within and between the EYS and health systems. Conclusions: The CLD provides a conceptual overview of the independent and integrated systems through which decision-makers can prioritize and guide interventions to strengthen healthcare coordination within and between the EYS and health systems. Overall, our research findings suggest that key variables such as streamlining communication and improving staff–youth relationships be prioritized, as each of these acts interdependently and influences YEH’s access, quality and coordination of healthcare. © 2024, The Author(s).",2024,,Health Res.

Examining the Role of Duration and Frequency of Homelessness on Health Outcomes Among Unsheltered Young Adults,"Richards, J.; Henwood, B.F.; Porter, N.; Kuhn, R.","Purpose: We examined the impact of duration and number of homelessness episodes on health outcomes for unsheltered homeless young adults. Methods: We analyzed the 2018/2019 Los Angeles County homeless youth demographic surveys. We addressed five summary health outcomes: physical health, mental health, substance use disorder, tri-morbidity, and any condition. Respondents were classified into three homeless trajectory groups: (1) short-term–homeless < 1 year in one episode, (2) episodic–homeless < 1 year and multiple episodes, and (3) long-term–homeless continuously for > 1 year. Weighted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models tested the relationship between homeless trajectory group and health, with controls for sociodemographic factors and structural exposures. Results: Mental health and substance use were high among unsheltered young adults compared to national rates. Long-term homeless respondents were significantly more likely than short-term to report a mental health condition (53.3% vs. 39.8%, p <.001), substance use disorder (25.5% vs. 18.3%, p <.001), and physical conditions (26.0% vs. 15.6%, p =.008). Episodic respondents were more likely to report a mental health condition (50.5%, p <.001). In multivariate models, long-term respondents had twice the odds of tri-morbidity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.14, p <.05) and any health condition (OR 2.00, p <.01) as short term and significantly higher odds of a physical health condition (OR = 1.64, p <.05). Discussion: Youth with longer durations and more frequent episodes of homelessness have substantially poorer health outcomes. The association of longer duration to poorer health persisted in multivariate models. Longer duration of unsheltered homelessness may drive the onset of physical and mental health problems. © 2023 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2023,,J. Adolesc.

"“When I think about my future, I just see darkness”: How youth exiting homelessness navigate the hazy, liminal space between socioeconomic exclusion and inclusion","Thulien, N.S.; Hwang, S.W.; Kozloff, N.; Nisenbaum, R.; Akdikmen, A.; Fambegbe, O.P.; Feraday, R.; Mathewson, C.; Mutamiri, M.; Roglich, J.; Wang, A.; Zagala, M.; Amiri, A.","Objectives: The overarching objective of this mixed methods longitudinal study was to understand whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influenced socioeconomic inclusion outcomes for youth exiting homelessness. The focus of this paper is on the qualitative objectives, which evolved from a primary focus on exploring how study mentorship was working as a facilitator of socioeconomic inclusion to focusing on how participants navigated the hazy, liminal space between socioeconomic exclusion and inclusion. Methods: This was a convergent mixed methods study scaffolded by community-based participatory action axiology. The quantitative component is reported elsewhere and involved a 2-year pilot randomized controlled trial where 24 participants received rent subsidies and 13 were randomly assigned a study mentor; proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion were measured every 6 months for 2.5 years. Qualitative objectives were explored using a qualitative descriptive design and theoretically framed using critical social theory. The lead author interviewed 12 participants every 6 months for 2.5 years. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with an emphasis on critical interpretation. Results: Navigating the liminal space between socioeconomic exclusion and inclusion was complex and non-linear, and the way youth navigated that journey was more strongly associated with factors like informal mentorship (naturally occurring “coach-like” mentorship) and identity capital (sense of purpose, control, self-efficacy, and self-esteem), rather than whether or not they were assigned a formal study mentor. Conclusion: A holistic approach integrating coaching and attention to identity capital alongside economic supports may be key to helping youth exiting homelessness achieve socioeconomic inclusion. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Can.

Children in street situations’ access to healthcare: qualitative findings from the Street Child World Cup 2022,"Macleod, S.L.; MacRae, P.; Pimenta, J.","Background Children in street situations (those who live or work on the street) are known to face barriers in accessing healthcare. Methods The study combined a remote survey with 33 adult non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff members, in-depth interviews with staff members of 11 NGOs and 4 formerly street-connected adult young leaders and a questionnaire with 30 street-connected children from 15 countries participating in the Street Child World Cup event in Qatar in 2022. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results The participating children have strong connections with supportive organisations and do tend to seek adult assistance when they are ill or injured, refuting the assertion of adult participants and the literature that children in street situations only seek healthcare in emergencies. Some barriers that children in street situations face when seeking healthcare are likely shared by other disadvantaged groups, including the cost of care, long waiting times, the quality of public healthcare and discrimination based on socioeconomic status. Children in street situations may face further discrimination based on assumptions about their lives, their appearance or hygiene levels. Identity documents are highlighted in the literature as a major barrier but seemed less important to the participants. Both adult and child participants emphasised the need for an accompanying adult to find appropriate services and be treated. Conclusions This study highlights the important work of organisations supporting street-connected children to access healthcare both during and after their time working or living on the street. It concludes that while some of the barriers to accessing healthcare that children in street situations face are not specific to this group, the absence of an adult caregiver differentiates many street-connected children from other disadvantaged groups. This also signals differences among children in street situations, with those with connections to family or organisations having more support. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.",2023,,BMJ Paediatr.

Prevention of Opioid Use and Disorder Among Youth Involved in the Legal System: Innovation and Implementation of Four Studies Funded by the NIDA HEAL Initiative,"Ahrens, K.; Blackburn, N.; Aalsma, M.; Haggerty, K.; Kelleher, K.; Knight, D.K.; Joseph, E.; Mulford, C.; Ryle, T.; Tolou-Shams, M.","Youth involved in the legal system (YILS) experience rates of opioid and substance use disorders (OUD/SUDs) and overdose that is well above those in the general population. Despite the dire need, and the existing programs that focus on treatment of these problems in YILS, research on opioid initiation, and OUD prevention, including feasibility and sustainability, are severely limited. We present four studies testing interventions that, while not necessarily novel as SUD treatments, test novel structural and interpersonal strategies to prevent opioid initiation/OUD precursors: (1) ADAPT (Clinical Trial No. NCT04499079) provides real-time feedback using community-based treatment information system data to create a more effective mental health and SUD treatment cascade to prevent opioid use; (2) HOME (Clinical Trial No. NCT04135703) provides youth experiencing homelessness, including YILS, with direct access to shelter in independent living without prerequisites as an opioid initiation prevention strategy; (3) LeSA (Clinical Trial No. NCT04678960) uses the Trust-Based Relational Intervention® to equip YILS and their caregivers with self-regulatory and communication skills during the transition from secure confinement to reduce opioid initiation/re-initiation; and (4) POST (Clinical Trial No. NCT04901312) tests two interventions integrating interpersonal/drinking and drug refusal skills, case management, and goal setting among YILS in transitioning out of secure detention as opioid initiation prevention strategies. We discuss early implementation barriers and facilitators, including complexities of prevention research with YILS and adaptations due to COVID-19. We conclude by describing anticipated end products, including implementation of effective prevention interventions and integration of data from multiple projects to address larger, multi-site research questions. © 2023, Society for Prevention Research.",2023,,Prev.

Opportunities and Challenges to Linkage to Housing in the Context of a Sexual and Reproductive Health Program for Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Huq, M.R.; Phillips, D.R.; Childers, C.; Chavez, R.; Tellei, J.; Blakely, L.; Aparicio, E.M.","Youth homelessness remains a major public health issue in the USA, and youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are still one of the more understudied and underserved groups. Comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs for YEH are rare. Yet, such programs are potentially effective settings through which to link YEH with housing services. Wahine (“woman”) Talk is one such comprehensive program for YEH, and is a multilevel intervention delivered out of a youth drop-in center in Honolulu, Hawai ‘i. One of Wahine Talk’s core components is addressing basic needs, including providing linkages to housing services. Little research exists on SRH programs’ opportunities and challenges to providing linkage to housing for YEH. The current study is an exploratory study asking, “What are opportunities and challenges to linking young women experiencing homelessness to housing services through a comprehensive sexual and reproductive health program?” The study team collected in-depth qualitative data through seven focus groups and 25 individual interviews with Wahine Talk staff and youth participants aged 14–22 years. Multiple team members analyzed the data using template analysis. The analysis revealed that while comprehensive SRH programs may have some opportunities and challenges to linking YEH to housing services that are consistent with traditional housing assistance programs, there are also factors specific to SRH programs. In particular, opportunities would be SRH programs employing a housing staff person and bolstering staff-youth meetings and communication. A challenge specific to SRH programs would be prioritizing youth’s reproductive justice (i.e., choice) in lieu of solely prioritizing pregnancy reductions and delays; thus, it is recommended to train staff to prioritize youth’s reproductive justice. The findings highlight the importance of SRH programs having staff focused on housing, sufficient opportunities for youth and staff to communicate with each other, and staff trained to prioritize youth’s reproductive justice. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Prev.

"Prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, drug use, and sexual behaviors among street children in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Nasiri, N.; Kostoulas, P.; Roshanfekr, P.; Kheirkhah Vakilabad, A.A.; Khezri, M.; Mirzaei, H.; Sharifi, A.; Sharifi, H.","Background and Aims: Street children face a disproportionately higher risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) due to high-risk sexual and drug use practices. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of these infections and related risk behaviors among street children in Iran. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science (ISI), Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar for the English-language records and Iranian databases, including SID, Magiran, and IRANDOC for the Farsi-language records up to September 18, 2022. Random effects analysis was used to obtain prevalence estimates for each condition. Homogeneity across included studies was assessed using I2. Results: We extracted data from 18 eligible studies, representing 5646 children (83.2% boys), with a mean age of 10.2 (range: 5–18). The prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV were 0.79% (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 0.0–5.56), 1.97% (95% CI: 1.01–3.19), and 1.88% (95% CI: 0.74–3.46), respectively. The prevalence of lifetime drug use and sexual abuse was 8.32% (95% CI: 4.83–12.62) and 10.18% (95% CI: 3.02–20.67) among street children, respectively. Conclusion: The estimated prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV among street children in Iran was higher than the estimates in the general population. Moreover, drug use and the experience of sexual abuse were prevalent among this population. These findings suggest the need for targeted prevention programs for street children in Iran. © 2023 The Authors. Health Science Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2023,,Heal. Sci.

A randomized controlled trial of a brief motivational interviewing-based group intervention for emerging adults experiencing homelessness: 12-Month effects on substance use and sexual risk behavior,"Tucker, J.S.; D'Amico, E.J.; Rodriguez, A.; Garvey, R.; Pedersen, E.R.; Klein, D.J.","Introduction: Few brief evidence-based risk reduction programs for emerging adults experiencing homelessness focus on the interrelated problems of substance use and sexual risk behavior. This study examines outcomes from a 12-month evaluation of AWARE, a brief Motivational Interviewing (MI)–based group risk reduction intervention for this population. Methods: In a cluster randomized crossover trial, N = 276 18–25-year-olds received AWARE or usual care at drop-in centers serving homeless youth in Los Angeles County. We evaluated intervention effects on substance use and condomless sex (primary outcomes), as well as drinking consequences and protective strategies, number of casual partners, self-efficacy, and motivation for change (secondary outcomes). Results: AWARE participants self-reported reductions in their alcohol use and negative consequences from drinking, and an increase in use of drinking protective strategies. AWARE participants also reported an initial decrease in drug use other than marijuana, followed by a slight uptake later on, as well as an initial increase in importance of cutting down on other drug use followed by a decrease. Control group participants did not show change in these outcomes. Among those who reported casual sex partners at both baseline and 12-month surveys, exploratory analyses indicated that AWARE participants had a 29 % decline in condomless sex with casual partners compared to a 6 % decline for control group participants. Conclusions: Findings build on our pilot work by demonstrating that AWARE has long-term benefits on drinking among emerging adults experiencing homelessness. Further work should seek to strengthen its long-term effectiveness in reducing drug use in this population. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023,,J. Subst. Use.

Understanding Young People’s Navigation of Housing Barriers Through a White Supremacy Lens,"Boyett, M.; Santarella, M.; Milligan, T.; DeChants, J.; Williams, O.; Bender, K.; Shelton, J.; Chassman, S.","The purpose of this study was to understand the organizational and structural barriers young people face in seeking housing and to interpret those barriers through the lens of white supremacy culture. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 31 young people (ages 18–26) accessing a variety of homeless services, including a drop-in center, emergency shelter, and transitional housing apartments. White supremacy culture was used as an organizing framework for interpreting thematic findings. Participants described bureaucratic and systemic barriers to accessing and maintaining stable housing; lacking resources necessary to securing and maintaining housing; and rigid rules in community and living environments that created difficult in maintaining safe housing. Five tenets of white supremacy culture emerged as we applied the organizing framework to our findings: power hoarding, paternalism, worship of the written word, fear of open conflict, and right to comfort. Our findings reflect that organizations employing bureaucratic processes hold power to determine who can access housing, what is required of those young people, and how housing can be maintained. Yet, those holding the power at these decision points often do not reflect the identities of those benefiting from the services. Future research and critical analysis using a white supremacy framework or Critical Race Theory may allow for better understanding of barriers for young people experiencing homelessness. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Child Adolesc.

COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among youth experiencing homelessness: a qualitative analysis with opportunities for action,"Balma, B.; Vasilakos, L.; Osman, I.; Elgonda, A.; Gewirtz O’Brien, J.R.","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, yet are often excluded from response planning during the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health crises. As part of a larger community- and youth-engaged project through a national network of Prevention Research Centers, our qualitative study sought to describe youth perspectives that influence COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake, and identify youth-driven strategies to guide public health efforts to improve vaccine confidence and access. We conducted focus groups with youth experiencing homelessness (n = 20) and semi-structured interviews with staff members (n = 10) at youth-serving agencies to solicit youth perspectives about COVID-19 vaccination. Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic qualitative analysis. In partnership with youth and cross-sector partners, we distilled eight salient themes that influenced COVID-19 vaccine uptake and confidence among YEH: 1. historical harms and mistrust of systems, 2. access to reliable health information, 3. prioritization of basic needs, 4. personal health influence, 5. barriers to healthcare, 6. fear and uncertainty of the vaccines, 7. sense of bodily autonomy, and 8. community influence. We also identified three youth-driven opportunities to increase COVID-19 vaccination among this population: emphasizing autonomy, leveraging trusted sources of information, and improving vaccine access.Our study elucidates perspectives of YEH on COVID-19 vaccination, and identifies several opportunities to improve youth vaccine confidence and access.

We assessed the QOL and mental health status as well as their associated factors among youth experiencing homelessness in Kerman, Iran. Method: We recruited 202 participants using a convenience sampling method from 11 locations, including six homeless shelters, three street outreach sites, and two drop-in service centers, from September to December 2017. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire that included QOL, mental health, demographics, drug use, and sexual behaviors questions. Scores in each domain were indexed with a weight of 0-100. The higher score indicated a higher QOL and mental health status. Bivariable and multivariable linear regression models were performed to examine correlates of QOL and mental health. Result: The mean (SD) score of QOL and mental health were 73.1 (25.8) and 65.1 (22.3), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that youth experiencing homelessness who were aged 25–29 years old (β = -5.4; 95% CI: -10.51; -0.30), and lived on the streets (β = -12.1; 95% CI: -18.19; -6.07) had a lower mental health score. Moreover, those who had higher education (β = 5.4; 95% CI: 0.58; 10.38), had no history of carrying weapons (β = 12.8; 95% CI: 6.86; 18.76), and had a higher QOL score (β = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.31; 0.50) had a higher mental health score. Conclusion: This study highlights that QOL and mental health among youth experiencing homelessness in Iran are concerning, particularly among those who were older, were less educated, were living on the street, and had a history of carrying a weapon.

Homelessness and housing insecurity among youth in Australia: sequence analysis of housing careers,"Elkins, M.; Farrell, L.; Fry, J.M.","Despite significant policy developments addressing youth housing insecurity in Australia, youth remain subject to multiple housing arrangements that can lead to homelessness more than any other cohort. We focus on the housing sequences of youths, and we seek information in the order and duration of accommodation types used. We employ Journeys Home–a unique longitudinal dataset specifically designed to examine issues relating to homelessness or housing instability in Australia. We combine accommodation calendars with data-driven sequence analysis techniques that holistically consider the information in the accommodation sequence. Specifically, we identify a set of distinct accommodation typologies and find that those who experience the greatest housing insecurity are comparatively less likely to be educated or employed and more likely to have dependent children who are not living with them.

“I Was Born Into a Nightmare”: The Chaotic Life Trajectories of Young Women Experiencing Homelessness,"Szeintuch, S.; Spector-Mersel, G.; Maor, T.; Metzer, R.","Objective: Although youth homelessness is a grave social problem in many nations, researchers and practitioners do not fully understand the needs of unaccompanied young adults who experience sheltered or unsheltered homeless-ness, nor their trajectories into and out of homelessness. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the life stories of young women experiencing homelessness in Israel and identifying characteristics of their trajectories into homelessness and ways of coping with the associated challenges. Method: Drawing on the narrative paradigm, we invited 12 young Israeli women (ages 18–25) representing different categories of homelessness to recount their life stories, which we analyzed induc-tively using a narrative holistic content approach. Results: The pathways leading participants to homelessness were varied, but chaos was the common denominator of their life stories. Some participants described a specific negative life event that led to their homelessness, whereas others described numerous ongoing contribu-tors to homelessness. All adopted survival strategies relying on both internal (e.g., optimism and the feeling of independence) and external resources (e.g., social work-ers’ interventions). Conclusions: To connect with young women experiencing homelessness and gain their trust, we recommend that practitioners become active bystanders.

Barriers and opportunities to supporting youth of color and LGBTQ + youth experiencing homelessness during COVID: A qualitative assessment,"Damian, A.J.; Ponce, D.; Gonzalez, M.; Azevedo, B.; Kokan, Z.; Ortiz-Siberon, A.","Purpose: Youth homelessness is a major public health issue that impacts millions of youth across the United States, with a disproportionate impact on LGBTQ + youth and youth of color. This study engaged adults who work at youth-serving organizations (YSO) in New Britain, Connecticut to better understand the perspectives and experiences of administrators and frontline workers serving youth experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 19 key informants over the age of 18 years old. Key informant interviews were guided by a semi-structured guide to understand three areas of interests from the perspective of youth-serving personnel: (1) identified needs of youth experiencing homelessness; (2) organizational and community barriers to addressing identified needs, and (3) communal assets and needs to be better positioned to serve youth experiencing homelessness, with a particular emphasis on youth of color and LGBTQ + youth. Constant comparative method was subsequently applied to analyze qualitative findings. Results: Major themes that emerged from the key informant interviews included: homeless youth lacking access to needed mental health services and a trusted support network; youth-serving professionals not being adequately equipped to address the unique needs of LGBTQ + youth and youth of color experiencing homelessness, and; a need for a centralized referral system for connecting YSOs with each other. Conclusion: The key informant interviews were a valuable way to engage YSOs and better understand, from their perspective, the health and health-related social needs of youth, particularly youth of color and LGBTQ + youth, experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as potential policy and programmatic solutions for addressing these challenges. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child.

"What do recently housed young people imagine for the future of third places? Using game-based inquiry to (re)imagine affirming, youth-centered third places","Littman, D.M.; Milligan, T.; Berry, R.; Holloway, B.; Scott, M.L.","Third places—public and community settings like parks and libraries—are theorized to serve as sources of social connection, community, and play. Yet, young people who hold marginalized identities, such as those experiencing homelessness and housing instability, often endure discrimination in third place settings. This study used game-based inquiry to partner with recently housed young people who have experienced chronic housing instability (N = 21) to understand how they would (re)imagine future third places. We then analyzed transcripts from these game sessions through qualitative thematic analysis. Participants suggested that certain tenets must be present in third places: they must offer opportunities for agency and individualization; they must meet everyday needs; and they must be explicitly inclusive. To actualize these tenets, participants imagined places that meet many needs and do many things; portable and adaptable physical spaces; freedom to choose how to play; attending to and subverting oppressive social hierarchies; providing choice for privacy or connection; knowing people will be around; and free amenities. These findings have implications for theoretical development, practices in present and future third places, and methodological development of games in research. © 2024 The Authors.

Drawing on analyses of law and on interviews with young persons in homelessness, the article examines legal opportunity structures for accessing rights and the young persons’ experiences of mobilizing law. Danish social law outlines opportunities for support in cases of homelessness, and this article’s findings suggest that professionals play a pivotal role for young persons’ access to rights as they can use their expertise and knowledge of both the systemic institutional welfare set-up and a person’s social situation to translate that person’s situation into a social law context, which is decisive for the mobilization of social rights. Without this expertise to draw on, young persons may find themselves lost in a complex welfare state system which has the potential to leave them in an increasingly marginalized situation. © 2024 Norwegian Centre for Human Rights.",2024,,Nordic J.

"Mental health and wellbeing outcomes associated with social, medical, and legal gender affirmation among trans young people in Australia","Grant, R.; Amos, N.; Lin, A.; Cook, T.; Hill, A.O.; Pang, K.; Skinner, R.S.; Carman, M.; Bourne, A.","Background: Gender affirmation is known to improve mental health among trans adults, but its impact on young people has been questioned. This study examined the mental health outcomes associated with social, medical, and legal gender affirmation among trans young people in Australia. Methods: Data from 1697 trans young people aged 14–21 who participated in an Australian national survey were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. We measured associations between gender affirmation and various mental health variables, including levels of happiness, psychological distress, anxiety, self-harm and recent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Associations between gender affirmation and young people’s wellbeing, including experiences of verbal harassment, homelessness, and drug use were also examined. Results: Participants who had affirmed their gender legally and medically (via hormone therapy or surgery/ies) reported lower levels of anxiety and psychological distress, while legal gender affirmation was associated with lower suicidal ideation. Social affirmation was not directly associated with wellbeing outcomes but was linked to an increased likelihood of verbal harassment and homelessness. All forms of gender affirmation were associated with increased drug use, which likely reflects the greater opportunities for social connection and LGBTQ-community involvement that trans young people experience when they take steps to affirm their gender. Conclusion: All forms of gender affirmation were positively associated with the wellbeing of trans young people. Though young people who had socially affirmed their gender faced higher likelihoods of experiencing verbal harassment and homelessness, this is likely linked to their increased visibility and subsequent vulnerability to discrimination. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address transphobia and discrimination. A comprehensive approach to supporting the wellbeing of trans young people should include legal, medical, and social affirmation, as well as addressing potential negative outcomes via societal education. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Priority healthcare needs amongst people experiencing homelessness in Dublin, Ireland: A qualitative evaluation of community expert experiences and opinions","Ingram, C.; MacNamara, I.; Buggy, C.; Perrotta, C.","In light of evidence that housing-related disparities in mortality are worsening over time, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of experts working in homeless health and addiction services on priority healthcare needs amongst people experiencing homelessness in Dublin, Ireland, a city facing problematic increases in homelessness. As part of a larger qualitative study, a series of semi-structured interviews were carried out with 19 community experts followed by inductive thematic framework analysis to identify emergent themes and sub-themes relating to priority healthcare needs. At the societal level, community experts identified a need to promote a culture that values health equity. At the policy level, accelerating action in addressing health inequalities was recommended with an emphasis on strategic planning, Housing First, social support options, interagency collaboration, improved data linkage and sharing, and auditing. At the health services level, removing barriers to access will require the provision of more and safer mental health, addiction, women-centred, and general practice services; resolved care pathways in relation to crisis points and multi-morbidity; expanded trauma-informed education and training and hospital-led Inclusion Health programmes; and outreach programmes and peer support for chronic disease management. The voices of people experiencing homelessness, including representatives from specific homeless groups such as migrants, youth, and the elderly, must be thoroughly embedded into health and social service design and delivery to facilitate impactful change.  © 2023 Ingram et al.

Child protection services and youth experiencing homelessness: Findings of the 2019 national youth homelessness survey in Canada,"Bonakdar, A.; Gaetz, S.; Banchani, E.; Schwan, K.; Kidd, S.A.; O'Grady, B.","Youth leaving or being discharged from child protection services (CPS) are a particularly vulnerable population in Canada that could be at an increased risk of homelessness, which has many adverse consequences including declining physical and mental health, school disengagement, involvement with the justice system, and substance use disorders. In this paper, we examine the extent to which youth accessing homelessness services with a history of involvement with CPS differ from their peers who have not interacted with CPS using the 2019 Without a Home: The National Youth Homelessness Survey—which is by far the largest study ever administered in Canada on youth homelessness (n = 1375). This examination includes a diverse range of life circumstances and outcomes, including quality of life, relationships with friends and family, criminal records, education, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Furthermore, controlling for demographic characteristics, we present risk factors that are likely to be correlated with youth homelessness, including ACEs and the CPS history, and conclude by discussing policy implications and proposing future research avenues. © 2023",2023,,Child.

Suicidality and homelessness: prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behaviour among homeless young adults in Southern Ethiopia,"Yohannes, K.; Gezahegn, M.; Birhanie, M.; Simachew, Y.; Moges, A.; Ayano, G.; Toitole, K.K.; Mokona, H.; Abebe, L.","Background: Research indicates that homelessness is associated with an increased risk of suicide. While street homelessness is a global problem, it is a disproportionately serious concern in low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Despite their high risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, there has been limited research on this subject among homeless young people in Ethiopia. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence and factors contributing to suicidal behaviour among homeless young people in the southern region of this country. Methods: We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study from 15 June to 15 August 2020 involving 798 homeless young adults in four southern Ethiopian towns and cities. The Suicide Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used to assess suicidal behaviour. Data were coded and entered into Epi-Data version 7 and analysed using SPSS version 20. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with suicidal behaviour. Variables with a p-value of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was determined to indicate the association’s strength. Results: The overall prevalence of suicidal behaviour among young homeless individuals was 38.2% (95% CI: 34.8%, 41.5%). The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning and attempt was 10.7% (95% CI: 8.6–12.9%), 5.1% (95% CI: 3.6–6.6%) and 3% (95% CI: 1.9–4.3%), respectively. A longer duration of homelessness (1–2 years) (AOR = 2.244, 95% CI: 1.447–3.481), stressful life events (AOR = 1.655, 95% CI: 1.132–2.418) and the stigma associated with homelessness (AOR = 1.629, 95% CI: 1.149–1.505) were significantly associated with suicidal behaviour. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that suicide is a serious public health problem among homeless young people in southern Ethiopia. We have found associations between suicidal behaviour and stressful events, homelessness lasting for one to two years and stigma. Our study suggests that policymakers and programme planners need to develop a strategy for preventing, detecting and managing suicidal behaviour among street-dwelling homeless young adults, a vulnerable and understudied population. A community-based suicide prevention campaign is also essential for street-dwelling homeless young people in Ethiopia. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,BMC Psychol.,11,1,,,10.1186/s40359-023-01162-x,,#333,Yohannes 2023,,
Adapting an evidence-based mindfulness-based intervention for sheltered youth experiencing homelessness,"Santa Maria, D.; Cuccaro, P.; Bender, K.; Sibinga, E.; Guerrero, N.; Keshwani, N.; Jones, J.; Fine, M.","Objectives: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face challenges that impact their physical, mental, and social wellbeing, emotion regulation, and coping. Mindfulness reduces stress and improves resilience, emotion regulation, and executive functioning. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) teach the practice of mindfulness to foster present-moment attention without judgement and enhance self-observation and self-regulation, resulting in greater awareness of thoughts and emotions and improved interpersonal relationships. One such intervention,.b, has been shown to lower stress among youth. While a pilot study of.b among sheltered youth found the intervention to be feasible, the need for modifications was identified to improve its relevance, accessibility, and incorporate a trauma-informed approach. Methods: We used the ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical experts, Integration, Training staff, and Testing) framework to adapt the.b mindfulness intervention to YEH living in an emergency shelter. Nine focus group discussions (n = 56), key informant interviews (n = 8), and beta testing with five youth working group sessions (n = 10) identified needed modifications. Results: Adaptations to the curriculum and delivery modality were made to approximate the average length of stay in the shelter; integrate trauma-informed care approaches; increase diversity of images by race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity; and increase the relevance of the audio-visual components. Conclusions: Youth and the health and social services providers who care for youth generally liked the core concepts and presentation of the curriculum. Using the ADAPT-ITT framework, minor, yet important, changes were made to increase the relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention. Next steps are to conduct a randomized attention control pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2023,,BMC Compl.

Intersectional Structural Stigma: A Qualitative Study With Persons Experiencing Homelessness in the Southwest United States,"Mercado, M.; Law, L.; Ferguson-Colvin, K.; Wolfersteig, W.","This study explored the manifestations of intersectional structural stigma and stigma-reducing strategies in the context of health among a diverse group of persons experiencing homelessness in the southwest United States. Purposive sampling was used to recruit youth (ages 12–17), young adults (ages 18–24), adults (ages 25 years old or older), women with children, veterans, and males over 60 years old who self-identified as homeless. Grounded theory was applied, and thematic analysis was conducted using data collected from seven focus groups (n = 76 participants). A model of intersectional stigma was adapted from the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. This adaptation depicts pathways for addressing intersectional stigmatization experienced by individuals with multiple intersecting identities across the interpersonal, organization, and community levels not explicitly addressed in the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. At the interpersonal level, participants indicated they experienced stigmatizing behaviors and practices by service providers due primarily to their identities related to economic or unhoused statuses, gender, age, and mental health. Facilitators of intersectional stigma were identified through organization practices and processes. Multiple stigmatized identities due to social beliefs also facilitated stigmatization at the community level. Health outcomes influenced by stigmatization were also identified. Despite the stigmatization they experienced, participants discussed stigma-reducing strategies related to community assets, medical care, and destigmatizing practices by service providers. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Qual.

Substance use and sentiment and topical tendencies: a study using social media conversations of youth experiencing homelessness,"Deng, T.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Lee, Y.J.; Dewri, R.; Bender, K.","Purpose: This study investigates associations between Facebook (FB) conversations and self-reports of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). YEH engage in high rates of substance use and are often difficult to reach, for both research and interventions. Social media sites provide rich digital trace data for observing the social context of YEH's health behaviors. The authors aim to investigate the feasibility of using these big data and text mining techniques as a supplement to self-report surveys in detecting and understanding YEH attitudes and engagement in substance use. Design/methodology/approach: Participants took a self-report survey in addition to providing consent for researchers to download their Facebook feed data retrospectively. The authors collected survey responses from 92 participants and retrieved 33,204 textual Facebook conversations. The authors performed text mining analysis and statistical analysis including ANOVA and logistic regression to examine the relationship between YEH's Facebook conversations and their substance use. Findings: Facebook posts of YEH have a moderately positive sentiment. YEH substance users and non-users differed in their Facebook posts regarding: (1) overall sentiment and (2) topics discussed. Logistic regressions show that more positive sentiment in a respondent's FB conversation suggests a lower likelihood of marijuana usage. On the other hand, discussing money-related topics in the conversation increases YEH's likelihood of marijuana use. Originality/value: Digital trace data on social media sites represent a vast source of ecological data. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using such data from a hard-to-reach population to gain unique insights into YEH's health behaviors. The authors provide a text-mining-based toolkit for analyzing social media data for interpretation by experts from a variety of domains. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,,Inf. Technol.

"Psychosocial Experiences of LGBTQIA+ Youth Experiencing Homelessness in Cape Town, South Africa","Gattis, M.; Henderson, N.; Kemmerer, A.; Fourie, J.","Social science literature demonstrates consistent trends of socioeconomic disadvantage and complex psychosocial problems for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, plus (LGBTQIA+) people globally. This is particularly salient in the area of homelessness among LGBTQIA+ youth in the literature from the Global North. This study sought to document and analyse the psychosocial experiences of LGBTQIA+ youth (aged 18 to 34) in Cape Town, South Africa. Through a mixed methods approach, using the theoretical frameworks of intersectionality, minority stress theory, and minority strengths theory, researchers examined semi-structured interview and survey data from 12 residents at an emergency shelter service organisation for LGBTQIA+ individuals experiencing homelessness in Cape Town. Findings indicate that residents in the shelter reported heightened levels of depression and experiences of discrimination. Several major themes emerged from interview transcript analysis, such as the role of culture, toxic masculinity, religion, substance use, and mental health concerns. Recommendations are that social workers continue to follow-up with residents once they have left the shelter to ensure that the interventions are successful and that programmes designed for the population should incorporate an understanding of these psychosocial aspects of LGBTQIA+ homelessness in South Africa. © Unisa Press 2024",2024,,South.

Intersecting transitions among 2S/LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness: A scoping review,"Goodyear, T.; Chayama, K.L.; Oliffe, J.L.; Kia, H.; Fast, D.; Mniszak, C.; Knight, R.; Jenkins, E.","Background: Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority (2S/LGBTQ+) youth under 30 years of age are inequitably impacted by homelessness. Root drivers of homelessness among 2S/LGBTQ+ youth and the service-related needs of this group are multifaceted and complex. A synthesis of research can inform responsive action to support 2S/LGBTQ+ youth experiencing and at risk for homelessness with the goal of promoting better health and material living conditions. Objective: To summarize the literature addressing health and social transitions among homeless 2S/LGBTQ+ youth. Methods: This scoping review study utilized PRISMA-ScR guidelines to search seven bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed, English-language empirical works published between 2000 and 2022. The sampling frame centered homeless 2S/LGBTQ+ youth, with attention to life-course transitions. Retrieved citations were de-duplicated and assessed for inclusion through title/abstract and full-text screening completed independently by two reviewers. Data were charted and synthesized with a descriptive summary and qualitative content analysis. Results: This scoping review yielded a total of 27 articles. Most articles reported on qualitative studies (n = 21) and originated from the United States (n = 18) and Canada (n = 6). Findings from the qualitative content analysis reflect intersecting health and social transitions related to: (i) leaving home, (ii) navigating street life, and (iii) orienting toward the future. The included studies detail the complex array of transitions 2S/LGBTQ+ youth navigate in relation to homelessness, often with limited supports and in structural contexts involving socioeconomic precarity. Conclusions: Findings underscore that multipronged and context-informed responses are required to meaningfully support 2S/LGBTQ+ youth experiencing and at risk for homelessness. Policy and practice interventions that are youth-centered, strengths-based, and grounded in a socioecological perspective may be optimally positioned to address the intersecting forms of structural vulnerability shaping transitions into and through homelessness for 2S/LGBTQ+ youth. © 2023 The Author(s)",2024,,Child.

Youth homeless shelter staff perceptions of a mobile recreation programme,"Hopper, T.; Costas-Bradstreet, C.; Spence, J.C.","Youth homelessness is a complex social issue and accounts for the fastest growing demographic of individuals living without a home. Though it is well established that recreation can support youth socially, physically, and emotionally, the community partner perspective is rarely incorporated. The purpose of this study was to incorporate the perspectives of supportive housing staff about the importance of a mobile recreation programme in the lives of youth experiencing homelessness. Five participants participated in a group interview and a reflexive thematic analysis approach was utilized. The findings indicate that RoW filled a necessary gap in supportive programming; that RoW provided a context to support youth to become more comfortable participating in recreation; and that RoW offered a break from everyday stressors through encouraged play and self-expression. Findings suggest that the recreation programme offered various opportunities for the youth to feel connected and to engage in meaningful activities. © 2024 Canadian Association for Leisure Studies / Association canadienne d’études en loisir.",2024,,Leis.

Health and Care Utilization Among Youth With a History of Parental Incarceration and Homelessness,"So, M.; Davis, L.; Barnes, A.J.; Freese, R.; Atella, J.; Shlafer, R.J.","Introduction: Despite widespread recognition of the health and social risks posed by parental incarceration (PI) and homelessness, these challenges are rarely considered in unison. We sought to (a) assess the experiences of homelessness among youth with and without a history of PI and (b) compare the health and healthcare utilization among youth with a combined history of PI and homelessness. Method: Examining data from eighth-, ninth-, and 11th-grade public school participants in the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 110,904), we calculated univariate and multivariate analyses to characterize the health status and care utilization of youth who have experienced PI, past-year homelessness, or both. Results: We observed higher prevalence of homelessness among youth with a history of PI compared to those without. The group with dual PI-homelessness experience had a higher proportion of youth that were younger, male, and non-White; and living in poverty or urban areas compared to youth with PI history only. Even after accounting for demographic factors, the dual PI-homelessness group evidenced higher expected odds for several physical health conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes), and differences in care utilization indicators relative to individual PI and homelessness groups. Discussion: Findings suggest that PI may be overrepresented among recently homeless youth and that youth with such dual experience possess distinct, and often elevated, health service needs. Health, education, housing, and other systems may need intersectoral strategies to better identify and support this at-risk subset of youth through clinical and policy approaches. © 2023 American Psychological Association",2024,,Fam.

The dynamics of street children in Nigerian cities: the significance of age and gender,"Ogunkan, D.V.","The characteristics of street children are a subject of contention among researchers. While some researchers affirm that the backgrounds of street children, despite some differences, are remarkably similar, others opine that the characteristics of children are diverse, changing by location, context and over time. Consequently, emerging research attention has shifted to focusing on and developing a deeper understanding of their predicaments and daily experiences on the street. To have a nuanced account of street children in Nigerian cities, the study recruited 788 from Ibadan, Osogbo and Akure, using convenience sampling approach. The participants include 532 (67.5%) street boys and 256 (32.5%) girls. The sampled street children were disaggregated by their variety of experiences, predicaments and aspirations using their age and gender. The findings show that street children’s schooling status, risks of violence/abuse, drug use and career aspirations, among others, vary considerably between street boys and street girls. Therefore, it is recommended that the intervention programmes for street children be sensitive to the diversity of their involvement with the street and that the formulation of intervention policies be cognizant of the differences in age and gender among street children. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2024,,J.

Although studies suggest that ICT use is surprisingly high among YEH, less is known about the factors associated with ICT use and the association between ICT use and online health information seeking behavior (OHISB) among YEH. Using Andersen's behavioral model of healthcare utilization as a theoretical framework, this study examined the prevalence of ICT use and its association with OHISB among YEH. Data were drawn from the cross-sectional study collected from YEH living in multi-sites (N = 1,426; Mage= 20.9). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with ICT use (i.e., access to a smartphone, mobile phone, and social media profile ownership) and the association between each ICT use and OHISB. The results showed that differences in ICT use among YEH based on different predisposing factors including YEH’s gender, race/ethnicity, employment status, and involvement in the public system. Analysis also revealed that access to mobile and smart phones are significantly associated with OHISB among YEH. Results from this study underscore the capacity of ICT use to efficiently address the health-related requirements of YEH and enhance their health outcomes.

However, youth’s desires and decision-making do not always align with the perspectives of various professionals and systems regarding how best to intervene during pregnancies and early parenting. Drawing on longitudinal interviews and fieldwork with young people in Vancouver, Canada, we explore how their romantic relationships powerfully shaped understandings of what was right and wrong and which actions to take during pregnancy and early parenting, and how these moral worlds frequently clashed with the imperatives of healthcare, criminal justice, and child protection systems. We demonstrate how a disjuncture between youth’s desires, decision-making and moralities, and the systems that are intended to help them, can further entrench young people in cycles of loss, defeat, and harm. These cycles are powerfully racialized for young Indigenous people in our context. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Cult. Med. Psychiatry,47,4,1043-1066,,10.1007/s11013-022-09813-1,,#362,Fast 2023,,
"Local rental market dynamics and homelessness rates among unaccompanied youths, single adults, and people in families","Tamla Rai, V.","This study examines how local rental market factors differentially influence community-level homelessness rates among unaccompanied youths, single adults, and people in families with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s point-in-time estimates in January 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States. The results from seemingly unrelated regressions for 270 metropolitan Continua of Care suggest that higher community-level rental vacancy rates were associated with lower homelessness rates among people in families but not among single adults and unaccompanied youths. Further, higher community-level crowded rates in rental units were associated with higher homelessness rates among single adults and unaccompanied youths but not among people in families. These findings suggest the differential association between rental market dynamics and homelessness among the homeless subgroups should inform subgroup-specific policy interventions and investment strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

“The Propellers of My Life” The Impact of Domestic Violence Transitional Housing on Parents and Children,"Wood, L.; McGiffert, M.; Fusco, R.A.; Kulkarni, S.","Housing and homelessness are frequent issues facing domestic violence (DV) survivors and their children. Several DV programs provide transitional housing (DVTH) to address the housing needs of DV survivors and their children. Despite wide use, little is known about the impact of DVTH, especially on child and parenting related needs and outcomes. Multiple structured interviews (82) were conducted with 27 parents with minor children living in DVTH in order to explore housing program experiences. Thematic analysis techniques produced three themes and seven subthemes about DVTH impact on parenting and child wellness. Overarching themes include: (1) DVTH helps to strengthen the parent–child relationship through a focus on family connection and health; (2). Transitional housing provides an opportunity for family stability via housing, material, and economic stability; (3). Time at DVTH allows family to access a diverse range of trauma-informed resources and social support to meet family goals. Barriers to these potential impacts are explored. Implications for practice with youth and parents include the need for extensive mental health and legal advocacy, programmatic models that emphasize resources, safety and the transition to permanent housing, and build on family strengths. Further research is needed to evaluate DVTH program outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Child Adolesc.

"Prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni, soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa in orphans and street children in Mwanza city, Northern Tanzania","Franz, A.; Fuss, A.; Mazigo, H.D.; Ruganuza, D.; Müller, A.","Background: Parasitic infections are highly prevalent in low-income environments worldwide. While orphans and street children represent a particularly vulnerable population group, they are often exempt from preventive interventions such as Mass Drug Administration. In part, this could be due to a lack of data showing the burden of disease in this group. This study aims to address this gap. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, 144 orphans and 112 street children were screened for Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni), Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium), soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa using POC-CCA testing, urine filtration, and Kato-Katz technique. Nutritional status, water- and washing patterns were determined using a standardised questionnaire. Ultrasonography was performed to screen for organ abnormalities. Results: The prevalence of S. mansoni determined by POC-CCA-test was 65.9% for orphans and 94.5% for street children. 19.2% of the orphans tested positive for S. mansoni in Kato Katz. Of the street children, 77.1% showed positive test results in Kato-Katz. Only 1.3% of the orphans stated in the questionnaire that they use the lake to wash, whereas 91.1% of the street children named the lake as at least one of their options for washing. Microscopy showed positive results for Giardia intestinalis (G. intestinalis) in 8.2% and for Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (E. histolytica/dispar) in 23% of orphans and 8.1% for G. intestinalis, and 23.8% for E. histolytica/dispar in street children. In the ultrasonography, we did not observe patterns that indicate severe periportal fibrosis. Conclusion: The results indicate a significantly higher rate of infections with S. mansoni in street children compared with orphans. This might be explained by the lack of access to adequate sanitation for street children as well as regular contact with the water of Lake Victoria. However, we did not find similar results concerning infection rates with protozoa. The study results show overall inadequate living conditions in this study population, which could be addressed by public health interventions. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Infection,51,5,1399-1406,,10.1007/s15010-023-01999-9,,#366,Franz 2023,,
"Reasons for leaving home and pattern of child abuse and substance misuse among street children in Khartoum, Sudan: a cross-sectional survey","Hassan, S.M.E.A.; Satti, S.A.; Alhassan, M.A.","Street children are particularly susceptible to health-related adversities, including those resulting from substance abuse and child abuse. Information on street children is deficient in Sudan. This study provides basic data on characteristics, factors for leaving home, the pattern of child abuse and substance misuse among street children in Khartoum State, Sudan. This is a descriptive, cross-sectional, and community-based study. Data were collected through direct questioning of a sample of street children using a structured, standardized, and pretested interview-administered questionnaire. Two hundred and seventy-five (275) street children were interviewed. Most street children were males (83%). Of the interviewed children, 36.7% were illiterate, 66.1% had a single parent, and 36% did not recognize a home to return to. The commonest reported reasons for being on the streets were family conflicts and financial/economic difficulties (28.4 % and 27.5%), respectively. 89.1% of the children admitted to being substance abusers, mostly of glue (86.5%) and smoked tobacco (67.3%).75.3% of the children reported being subjected to a form of abuse, with physical and sexual abuse reported by 70.2% and 27%, respectively. Of the 74 children who reported sexual abuse, 49 were males (29% of males), and 25 were females (65% of females). The survey results are thought to guide further research and shape appropriate policymaking and coordinated interventions by concerned stakeholders, whether governmental or non-governmental.

Psychological distress mediates the link between bullying and truancy in Australian LGBQ+ adolescents with experiences of homelessness,"Lim, G.; Melendez-Torres, G.J.; Amos, N.; Anderson, J.; Norman, T.; Power, J.; Jones, J.; Bourne, A.","Homelessness is a high prevalence experience among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ+) youth, and potentiates both significant morbidity and future homelessness. While educational attainment is cited as a structural solution to homelessness, limited research exists on homeless LGBQ+ youths’ schooling experiences. A nationwide, cross-sectional survey involving 4,370 cisgender LGBQ+ participants aged 14–21 was conducted to address this gap. Regression analyses showed previous homelessness was associated with an increased odds of verbal, physical and sexual bullying and harassment within school contexts. Mediation analyses confirmed the mediating role of psychological distress on the associations between physical and sexual harassment and truancy, regardless of past homelessness. Previous experiences of homelessness are not associated with increased distress in relation to bullying or harassment. However, the indirect effect of harassment on truancy was significantly more pronounced for youth with past homelessness. Our findings crucially suggest that bullying presents both direct and indirect structural risks to cisgender LGBQ+ youth, and is particularly inconducive to continued engagement with schooling for youth with experiences of homelessness. Interventions aiming to address truancy among this group should aim to reduce the incidence of bullying within educational settings, whilst also providing assistance for managing the challenges associated with experiencing homelessness. © 2024 The Author(s).

Homelessness Among Sexual Minority Youth,"Deal, C.; Gonzales, G.","OBJECTIVES: This study examines the prevalence and types of homelessness experienced by sexual minority and heterosexual youth. Then, we examine whether state-level nondiscrimination policies and/or public attitudes on sexual diversity are associated with reduced homelessness among sexual minority youth. Finally, we investigate the differences in health risk behaviors at the intersections of sexual minority and homelessness status. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis using a large population-based sample from 21 states collected in the 2017 and 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Self-reported data were obtained from sexual minority (n =28 405) and heterosexual (n = 136 232) youth through a survey administered in high schools. We assessed the prevalence of homelessness and the types of homelessness. Sexual minority-stratified bivariate and multivariable analyses assessed associations between homelessness, state-level policy and cultural environments, and health-risk behaviors. RESULTS: Sexual minority youth were significantly more likely (12%) to be homeless compared with heterosexual youth (4.1%). Greater acceptance of sexual diversity at the state-level was associated with reduced homelessness among both sexual minority and heterosexual youth. Finally, homeless sexual minority youth experienced a broad array of health risk behaviors in excess of both nonhomeless sexual minority youth and homeless heterosexual youth. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minority high school students were more likely to experience homelessness than their heterosexual peers. Public attitudes and greater acceptance of sexual diversity were associated with lower levels of sexual minority homelessness.

Anonymous self-report survey data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System represented approximately 6.5 million high school students in 29 regions of the United States. An estimated 9.32% of students experienced homelessness. Path analysis found homelessness was related to poor functioning, accounting for victimization and demographic factors. Latent class analysis found the highest risk profiles had high levels of homelessness, victimization, and poor functioning and an overrepresentation of multiracial, Native, and Hispanic/Latino students, and students with LGBT identities.

"Pushed, Dropped, or Fleeing from Care: The Narratives and Adultification of Black Youth Who Have Aged out of Ontario’s Child Welfare System","Edwards, T.; Chowdhury, R.; Laylor, A.; Parada, H.; King, B.","Black youth have consistently reported that when they are transitioning from out-of-home care (OOHC) into independence, they are not supported or included in decision-making, and they feel isolated and vulnerable as they face an uncertain future. Previous research has documented the ways in which Black youths’ experiences in care are characterized by unpredictability and loss, but then care ends—and they continue to struggle. For Black youth in care, this transition can be exceptionally difficult as they are contending with the additional strain of doing so within the child welfare system and larger social context characterized by a loss of community and the persistence of anti-Black racism. Presently, there are no empirical studies in Ontario that investigate Black youth’s narratives transitioning from OOHC; this manuscript seeks to fill this gap in knowledge. Employing Adultification and Anti-Black Racism Theory as theoretical frameworks, this qualitative study investigated the narratives of 27 Black youth with lived experiences navigating OOHC in Ontario’s child welfare system. This study utilized narrative inquiry as a methodological approach. Three main narratives were identified: (1) the need for finances and a financial literacy; (2) narratives of aging out and (3) the challenges of navigating funding. To better support Black youth in their transition out of care and in independent living, recommendations for policy and practice include earlier transitional support, ensuring youth have a practical understanding of financial literacy, and educating youth about resources and their rights. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,Child Youth Serv.,45,3,371-401,,10.1080/0145935X.2023.2173565,,#374,Edwards 2024,,
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of health, functional, and cognitive outcomes in young people who use methamphetamine","Guerin, A.A.; Bridson, T.; Plapp, H.M.; Bedi, G.","Methamphetamine use typically starts in adolescence, and early onset is associated with worse outcomes. Yet, health, functional, and cognitive outcomes associated with methamphetamine use in young people are not well understood. The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess the evidence on health, functional, and cognitive outcomes in young people (10–25 years-old) who use methamphetamine. Sixty-six studies were included. The strongest association observed was with conduct disorder, with young people who use methamphetamine some 13 times more likely to meet conduct disorder criteria than controls. They were also more likely to have justice system involvement and to perpetrate violence against others. Educational problems were consistently associated with youth methamphetamine use. The cognitive domain most reliably implicated was inhibitory control. Key limitations in the literature were identified, including heterogenous measurement of exposure and outcomes, lack of adequate controls, and limited longitudinal evidence. Outcomes identified in the present review – suggesting complex and clinically significant behavioural issues in this population – are informative for the development of future research and targeted treatments. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,Neurosci.

Utilizing a sample of 287 homeless street youth the paper explores the criminogenic impacts of three different operationalizations of self-control. It investigates the direct effects of bonding self-control, attitudinal self-control, and decisional self-control on violence and assesses the indirect relationships that bonding self-control and attitudinal self-control have with violence through their associations with decisional self-control. Results indicate all three measures of self-control contribute to the understanding of intentions to engage in violence.

‘I didn’t want to be noticed’: discrimination and violence among LGBTQ + youth experiencing homelessness,"Côté, P.-B.; Frésard, L.; Blais, M.","This qualitative study documents incidents of discrimination and violence among LGBTQ + youth experiencing homelessness along with their adaptation strategies. Using intersectionality theory, this analysis is based on individual interviews conducted with 17 LGBTQ + youth experiencing homelessness aged 17 to 25. According to their stories, LGBTQ + youth experienced various types of discrimination and violence in the context of homelessness. Youth report anticipating and experiencing physical and psychological violence from passersby in public spaces, causing them to hide from the gaze of others. They also report that police profiling of racialized youth and young women sex workers leads these youth to avoid confrontational interactions with the police. Some youth mention that landlords and employers discriminate against them based on their ethnicity and gender expression, requiring them to have contingency plans for housing and employment. Lastly, many LGBTQ + youths report hiding information about being bisexual, being trans or doing sex work to avoid prejudice and rejection from their intimate partners. The results show that heterosexist, cisgenderism, sexist and racist discrimination and violence amplify the social exclusion of LGBTQ + youth who are already marginalized due to their homelessness. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,J.

Building resilience of street-connected children during COVID-19: turning rights into practices through CINI method,"Bhattacharyya, D.; Chakraborty, S.","This article examines the methods and opportunities for SCC’s meaningful participation that recognize their agency and are aligned with General Comment No. 21 (GC21) to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) on Children in Street Situations (UNCRC, 1989). This article explains the application of CINI’s core practice models which explains the child centrality in development practices for “turning rights into practice for children” derived from the Sustainable Development Goals, principles of Human Rights, UNCRC, and General Comment No. 20 (2016). The Institutional knowledge was practiced through child-led action research with street- connected children which resulted in the development of agency among SCC, peer researchers, and child advocates for resilience building within their community during COVID-19. Child in Need Institute (CINI) has been working with SCC since 1989 and has derived a rich body of experience from the interventions. CINI applied participatory approaches to practice, research, decision-making, and policy development; thus, facilitating children in the process of systematically gathering information with their peers, identifying key issues and problems faced by SCC, and securing support from duty bearers that were required for the survival within their situations. Drawing on the approach undertaken and the tools used in the participatory research and advocacy, this article reflects upon the processes and strategies that worked out in facilitating SCC’s ability to exercise agency and resilience through evidence generation and advocacy during COVID-19 and the associated lockdown and beyond. Through capacity building on research tools, leadership and communication skills, SCC can build concrete evidence of their vulnerabilities and the gaps that pose as barriers to their access to existing support mechanisms. This evidence helps them to prioritize the solutions that are required to bring changes in their lives and that of their peers, with which they can advocate at different platforms that promote dialogs and negotiations between children and duty-bearers. A participatory research project funded by Wellcome Trust focused on the vulnerabilities faced by street-connected young people and the access to services available to them. It revealed the lack of understanding regarding SCC and their invisibility in data and planning of support services, the gaps in access to healthcare services, the social determinants of health including safety, and their exclusion in platforms for dialogs with duty bearers. They took these issues to local government leaders, service providers, and national and international advocacy platforms; and suggested solutions to local and world leaders to bring changes in their situations. This resulted in a marked increase in the responsiveness of service providers toward SCC during the period of COVID-19, and the increased agency and negotiation skills of peer leaders to support their communities and demand solutions during the period of COVID-19 and associated lockdown.

"Assessing Homelessness and Incarceration Among Youth Aging Out of Foster Care, by Type of Disability","Lee, J.A.S.; Gimm, G.; Mohindroo, M.; Lever, L.","Youth in foster care are at greater risk of incarceration and homelessness as they age out of care and transition to adulthood. Prior studies have shown that multiple placements, childhood trauma, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment are associated with these adverse outcomes. However, few studies have examined the prevalence and risk factors of incarceration and homelessness among youth in foster care with disabilities as they age out and transition into adulthood. Using data from the 2014 cohort of the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System (AFCARS), this study examines the prevalence of incarceration and homelessness by disability type at age 17, and how risk factors are related to incarceration and homelessness at ages 19 and 21. Findings show that youth in foster care with emotional disabilities are more likely to experience homelessness and incarceration, but this association was not robust in multivariate models. On the other hand, those with a physical or intellectual/developmental disability have lower odds of homelessness. Employment and school enrollment are associated with a lower risk of homelessness and incarceration, regardless of disability type. These results suggest that disaggregating youth in foster care by type of disability is necessary to provide specific recommendations to improve and target resources and supports for these vulnerable youth as they age out of foster care and transition to adulthood. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Child Adolesc.

This study explores the role of protective factors in reducing rates of substance use and depression based on high school surveys. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between exposures and outcomes. Youth completed surveys in 2018 (n = 16,288) and in 2021 (n = 10,792). GM students reported exposure to protective factors less frequently than their cisgender peers: good financial status (88.6% vs. 96.5% in 2018 and 95% vs. 97.8% in 2021), feeling a sense of school/community membership, (mean score 2.7 vs. 3.0 in 2018 and 2.6 vs. 3.0 in 2021) or having two or more caring adults in their life (61.5% vs. 79.7% in 2018 and 64.2% vs. 80.6% in 2021).

Ending youth homelessness is about relationships: The importance of drop-in centers and staff to youth experiencing homelessness,"Rice, E.; Thompson, N.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Petry, L.; Petering, R.; Casey, E.; Cooper, T.; DiBattiste, M.; McAlpin, F.","Background: Drop-in centers are safe havens for youth experiencing homelessness. We examine drop-in centers within a positive youth development (PYD) framework to explore the role social connections with staff on the psychosocial development and stability of youth experiencing homelessness. Two study objectives guide this analysis: 1) examine the characteristics of youth who are both connected to drop-in centers and have a positive relationship with an adult staff member and 2) investigate the extent to which positive relationships with staff are associated with engagement in services that promote long-term stability and self-sufficiency. Methods: A sample of 784 youth experiencing homelessness were surveyed between May 2017 and November 2018 at three drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA. All youth accessing drop-in services during recruitment days were invited to participate. Youth self-reported drop-in center use (i.e., frequency and duration), connections to drop-in center staff, and service engagement (e.g., employment, education, housing, and health services). Frequency distributions and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted with SAS 9.4. Results: Over one-third of youth experiencing homelessness reported attending the drop-in center for six months or more and 28.3 % reported using that center on a daily basis. Two-thirds of youth reported having “developed at least one relationship with a supportive and positive staff at an agency that I attend.” Youth attending for six months or more were significantly more likely to report having a positive staff relationship (OR = 1.73, p < 0.001), as were youth who attended daily (OR = 1.85, p < 0.01). Youth who reported having a positive relationship with a staff member were more likely to report using employment programs and to possess knowledge of housing program options, controlling for drop-in center engagement and demographics. Moreover, youth who reported daily drop-in center use were more likely to report use of education and employment services and knowledge of housing options, controlling for staff relationships and demographics. Conclusions and Implications: PYD provides an important framework for addressing gaps in the current literature and exploring the role of drop-in centers in assisting youth experiencing homelessness. Positive adult staff play an integral part in the experiences youth have in drop-in center spaces, helping link youth to services that promote well-being, self-sufficiency, and the attainment of safe and stable housing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child.

"Building Resilience through Intervention, Direct Guidance, and Empowerment (BRIDGE): A demonstration project to assist youth aging out of foster care in Poland","Toro, P.A.; Turner, T.N.; Szarzyńska, M.E.","Building Resilience through Intervention, Direct Guidance, and Empowerment (BRIDGE) is an innovative program designed to prevent homelessness and other negative outcomes among youth aging out of foster care. BRIDGE was pilot-tested on youth aging out of two orphanages in a city in southern Poland in 2009–2012. Youth were recruited at age 17, before aging out at age 18. Quasi-experimental methods were used to evaluate program outcomes among nine BRIDGE clients compared to two matched groups (n = 9 and n = 18) of youth who had recently aged out of orphanages in the same Polish region. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, results of chi-square tests showed that, over an 18-month follow-up period, BRIDGE clients experienced superior housing outcomes relative to both matched groups. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, the results of a between-subjects ANOVA showed that BRIDGE clients received significantly greater income relative to the matched groups. Within-subjects effects of BRIDGE from baseline across 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups were examined with repeated-measures ANOVAs. Consistent with Hypotheses 3–5, results showed that across time BRIDGE clients experienced a general increase in income and decrease in psychological distress (i.e., total distress, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, and paranoia). The study’s findings support the further development of BRIDGE and similar programs. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,J. Prev.

The Social Organization of Pervasive Penality in the Lives of Young People Experiencing Homelessness,"Nichols, N.; Malenfant, J.","Research affirms that municipal laws regulate and criminalize activities associated with homelessness. Research has yet to explore how these laws intersect with other socio-legal processes to create socially organized relations of surveillance and punishment for those who are its targets. This participatory institutional ethnography began with interviews with precariously housed and homeless youth to learn about their socio-legal histories across a range of public sector institutions. Analysis of interviews revealed common points of friction in young people’s lives, which anchored subsequent policy and legislative analysis. In this article, we show how young people’s early experiences with the police recursively organize how their subsequent criminal-legal work unfolds—particularly, as they spend more time in public spaces that are governed by neo-vagrancy by-laws and provincial safe streets legislation. Analytically, the concept of pervasive penality (Herring et al., Social Problems 67: 131–149 2020) oriented us toward the socio-legal relations that link the activities of young people on the streets with police officers, child protection workers, public transit guards, and other professionals who administer policy and law. Homeless youth are often drawn into relations of surveillance because they are viewed to be in need of protection; over time, however, these same relations position youth as the targets of penalizing policies and laws. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",2023,,Crit.

"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Policies and Interventions that Improve Health, Psychosocial, and Economic Outcomes for Young People Leaving the Out-of-Home Care System","Taylor, D.; Albers, B.; Mann, G.; Lewis, J.; Taylor, R.; Mendes, P.; Macdonald, G.; Shlonsky, A.","Young people who transition to adulthood from out-of-home care (OOHC) are more likely to experience a range of poorer outcomes relative to their same-age peers in the community. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of policies or interventions (hereafter “interventions”) aimed at improving housing, health, education, economic, and psychosocial outcomes for youth leaving OOHC (hereafter “care leavers”). Eleven databases of published literature were reviewed along with gray literature. Eligible studies used randomized or quasi-experimental designs and assessed interventions that provided support to care leavers prior to, during, or after they left OOHC. Primary outcomes were housing and homelessness, health and well-being, education, economic and employment, criminal and delinquent behavior, and risky behavior, while secondary outcomes were supportive relationships and life skills. Where possible, results were pooled in a meta-analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Fourteen studies published in 27 reports were identified that examined independent living programs (ILPs) (n = 5), intensive support services (n = 2), coaching and peer support (C&PSP) (n = 2), transitional housing (n = 1), health information or coaching (n = 2), and extended care (n = 2). All but one study was conducted in the United States. Twenty small meta-analyses were undertaken encompassing ILPs and C&PSP, with two showing results that favored the intervention with certainty. The level of confidence in each meta-analysis was considered very low. A significant risk of bias was identified in each of the included studies. While some interventions showed promise, particularly extended care, the scope and strength of included evidence is insufficient to recommend any included approach. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Trauma Violence Abuse,,,,,10.1177/15248380241253041,,#394,Taylor 2024,,
A Qualitative Inquiry of Associations Between Family Environment and Suicidality for Transgender Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Morrow, Q.J.; McGuire, J.K.","Correlational research finds that transgender youth who have been homeless are more likely to have attempted suicide; however, there is not yet research explaining why this correlation might exist. To understand connections between housing insecurity and suicidality for transgender people the present study analyzed in-depth interviews with 30 transgender young people (ages 15–25) in the United States who had experienced homelessness. Interviews took place in LGBTQ community centers, and were analyzed for inductive themes using Qualitative Content Analysis. In contrast with theories suggesting that homelessness predicts increased suicidality because of the stressors of homelessness, this study found that gender-based parental rejection and other dysfunctional family dynamics interacted to create a hostile environment that contributed to both suicidality and homelessness for trans participants. In fact, suicide attempts occurred most often while participants still lived in disaffirming homes and usually ceased after participants left the unsafe home, suggesting that leaving a disaffirming family home, even if it results in homelessness, may decrease suicidality for some youth. Findings suggest that service providers working with transgender youth experiencing homelessness must consider familial gender disaffirmation, other familial stressors, and lack of access to shelter as equal threats to trans youth’s wellbeing and design interventions accordingly. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,J.

Enabling Adherence to Treatment (EAT): a pilot study of a combination intervention to improve HIV treatment outcomes among street-connected individuals in western Kenya,"Kibel, M.; Nyambura, M.; Embleton, L.; Kiptui, R.; Galárraga, O.; Apondi, E.; Ayuku, D.; Braitstein, P.","Background: Street-connected individuals (SCI) in Kenya experience barriers to accessing HIV care. This pilot study provides proof-of-concept for Enabling Adherence to Treatment (EAT), a combination intervention providing modified directly observed therapy (mDOT), daily meals, and peer navigation services to SCI living with HIV or requiring therapy for other conditions (e.g. tuberculosis). The goal of the EAT intervention was to improve engagement in HIV care and viral suppression among SCI living with HIV in an urban setting in Kenya. Methods: This pilot study used a single group, pre/post-test design, and enrolled a convenience sample of self-identified SCI of any age. Participants were able to access free hot meals, peer navigation services, and mDOT 6 days per week. We carried out descriptive statistics to characterize participants’ engagement in EAT and HIV treatment outcomes. We used McNemar’s chi-square test to calculate unadjusted differences in HIV outcomes pre- and post-intervention among participants enrolled in HIV care prior to EAT. We compared unadjusted time to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and first episode of viral load (VL) suppression among participants enrolled in HIV care prior to EAT vs. concurrently with EAT using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. We calculated total, fixed, and variable costs of the intervention. Results: Between July 2018 and February 2020, EAT enrolled 87 participants: 46 (53%) female and 75 (86%) living with HIV. At baseline, 60 out of 75 participants living with HIV (80%) had previously enrolled in HIV care. Out of 60, 56 (93%) had initiated ART, 44 (73%) were active in care, and 25 (42%) were virally suppressed (VL < 1000 copies/mL) at their last VL measure in the 19 months before EAT. After 19 months of follow-up, all 75 participants living with HIV had enrolled in HIV care and initiated ART, 65 (87%) were active in care, and 44 (59%) were virally suppressed at their last VL measure. Among the participants who were enrolled in HIV care before EAT, there was a significant increase in the proportion who were active in HIV care and virally suppressed at their last VL measure during EAT enrollment compared to before EAT enrollment. Participants who enrolled in HIV care concurrently with EAT had a significantly shorter time to initiation of ART and first episode of viral suppression compared to participants who enrolled in HIV care prior to EAT. The total cost of the intervention over 19 months was USD $57,448.64. Fixed costs were USD $3623.04 and variable costs were USD $63.75/month/participant. Conclusions: This pilot study provided proof of concept that EAT, a combination intervention providing mDOT, food, and peer navigation services, was feasible to implement and may support engagement in HIV care and achievement of viral suppression among SCI living with HIV in an urban setting in Kenya. Future work should focus on controlled trials of EAT, assessments of feasibility in other contexts, and cost-effectiveness studies. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,BMC Health Serv.

Supporting intersecting cultural needs of gender and age by increasing cultural safety and humility for Housing First initiatives,"Fang, M.L.; Canham, S.L.; Battersby, L.","Background: To sufficiently house and support persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), deeper understandings of the cultural appropriateness and responsiveness of community resources and the service delivery system is essential. In the case of Metro Vancouver, Canada, the cultural appropriateness and responsiveness of Housing First as a service model for supporting PEH was explored. Methods: Local service providers and stakeholders (n = 52) participated in three full day service-mapping workshops to identify Housing First supports for older adults, youth, and women experiencing homelessness, as part of a municipal-wide participatory and action-oriented study. Data were analyzed using a structured framework thematic analysis approach and cultural safety and humility lenses. Results: We generated three key themes: (i) insufficient built environments create challenges across gender and age, (ii) cultural safety and humility concerns at the intersection of gender and age, and (iii) implications for a culturally-responsive Housing First implementation.

Adverse Childhood Experiences and Depression among Homeless Young Adults: A Social Determinants of Health Perspective,"Wu, S.; Ta, L.; Vieira, J.; Schwartz, K.; Perez, J.; Zeien, J.; Li, D.; Hartmark-Hill, J.","Homelessness is a pervasive issue in the United States that presents significant challenges to public health. Homeless young adults (HYAs) are at particular risk for increased incidence and severity of depression. Using primary survey data (n = 205) collected in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area, Arizona, from June to August 2022, this study aims to examine the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and depression among HYAs. We adopted the ACEs 10-item scale to measure childhood traumatic experiences, whereas depression was measured by using a PHQ-4 depression scale and diagnosed depression. Regression models were conducted to test the relationships between ACEs and depression outcomes while controlling for the covariates at the individual, interpersonal, and socioeconomic/living environment levels. The average PHQ-4 score was 5.01 (SD = 3.59), and 59.69% of HYAs reported being diagnosed previously with depression. The mean ACEs score was 5.22 out of 10. Other things being equal, for every one unit increase in ACEs scores, the odds of being diagnosed with depression increased by 11.5%, yet it was not statistically significant, while the PHQ-4 score increased by 0.445 (p < 0.001). Overall, HYAs were disproportionately affected by depression. This study elucidates the complex relationship between ACEs and depression among HYAs. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Int. J. Environ.

The relevance of ableism in social (work) pedagogy,"More, R.","Ableism, a system of thought that creates notions of normality based on abilities and ability expectations, is closely tied to capitalist logics that promote the productive citizen. While the pursuit of certain abilities is a fundamental part of any society, the individualisation of abilities and the coercive character of some ability expectations marginalise people differing from the ideal citizen as unprofitable and burdensome. Through issues of access to various social support services and through social practice within in the welfare system, the need to consider ableism and its consequences in social (work) pedagogy becomes apparent. The aim of this theoretical essay is to emphasise the relevance of ableism in social (work) pedagogy by linking ableism theory to critical debates in social pedagogy/social work. I first describe the concept of ableism and its roots in Disability Studies, but also its relevance exceeding them. Second, I argue for anti-ableism as a critical pedagogy and third, I elaborate its relevance in the context of social work by drawing on examples of structural ableism evident in youth vocational support and homeless services. Finally, I explain how anti-ableism may be anchored in social (work) pedagogy. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2024,,Pedagog. Cult.

Formal and Informal Support among Mothers Aging out of Foster Care and Maternity Group Homes: Who Steps in When Mothers Age Out?,"Sabti Samarah, E.M.; Radey, M.; Boel-Studt, S.","Young mothers in foster care and their children face educational, financial, and social challenges. Maternity group homes (MGHs) offer one intervention to mitigate poor outcomes. Yet, information about the experiences of mothers transitioning from MGHs is limited. Using Kool’s Theory of Adolescent Identity Development, this study examines mothers’ transitions out of MGHs and the role of formal and informal support in helping meet their family’s needs. Mothers with experience living in an MGH (n = 25) participated in telephone interviews describing their experiences in MGHs and transitions to independence. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to understand mothers’ use of formal and informal supports after MGH exit. Analysis revealed that although mothers perceived “doing it alone,” they relied on informal and formal supports. This paradox makes sense in the context of mothers’ lives. Complicated, unpredictable, and friction-laden relationships with family, friends, and acquaintances constitute mothers’ informal supports. Although mothers felt they could count on family, they described periods of homelessness, family violence, and hopelessness. Similarly, formal relationships with child welfare professionals varied and often dissipated without warning. Mothers held mixed views on government assistance although these resources consistently provided critical means for survival. Implications: Consistent with Kool’s theory, study findings suggest mothers lacked supportive relationships and critical resources that shaped identity development. Implications for assisting mothers transitioning include supporting mothers through public assistance benefits before and after MGH exit; universal basic income as they gain independence, and guidance in establishing healthy relationships. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Child Adolesc.

Experiences of Abuse: Homeless Former Foster Youth and Their Experiences of Abuse in Out-of-Home Care,"Yoshioka-Maxwell, A.","Research has indicated that youth exiting foster care experience a wide range of risk factors, some of which result from extensive abuse histories. Self-reported abuse in out-of-home care placement has been largely unexamined, and no studies have assessed the experiences of abuse among homeless youth with histories of care. This study seeks to explore the prevalence of abuse and any associations it may have with other aspects of foster care placement. Quantitative data were collected from 184 homeless former foster youth at a drop-in center in Hollywood, California, using. Dichotomous questions pertaining to abuse within foster homes, group homes, and kinship care were asked, including experience with physical/sexual abuse by a foster parent, physical/sexual abuse by a foster sibling, and verbal abuse more generally. Frequencies and correlations were conducted. Relatively high frequencies of youth reported having experienced abuse in foster care, with significant negative correlations between number of foster care placements and age at first foster care placement for most types of abuse and positive associations between time in foster care and most types of abuse. Overall, high numbers of youth in out-of-home care report abuse experiences. Positive correlations exist between time spent in foster care with abuse in foster homes and group homes. This may result from abuse occurring in placements where youth are spending longer periods, and foster youth are spending longer periods with foster families, group home residents and staff. Implications for abuse reporting and policy change are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Child Adolesc.

Using regression analysis, we employ linked administrative data sets from police and from HF programs to examine how interactions of youth with police change following admission to a HF program.

Unconditional quantile regression is used to observe HF’s effect on changes in both the number and severity of criminal incidents. Controlling for demographic characteristics of youth and for type of housing program and using administrative police records as opposed to self-reported police interactions, we find only weak evidence to suggest that the number of criminal incidents falls following admission to a HF program and only weak evidence of a fall in the seriousness of crimes. © Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice.",2023,,Can.

Relationships That Persist and Protect: The Role of Enduring Relationships on Early-Adult Outcomes among Youth Transitioning Out of Foster Care,"Okpych, N.J.; Park, S.; Powers, J.; Harty, J.S.; Courtney, M.E.","Long-lasting, supportive relationships (what we call “enduring relationships”) are important for youths’ transition to adulthood, but these relationships are often ruptured for young people in foster care. We investigate how common enduring relationships are among youth making the transition out of care and whether having an enduring relationship improves their outcomes in early adulthood. Our sample includes 608 youths in California foster care (n 5 608) participating in the longitudinal CalYOUTH Study. We find that 48 percent of youth have an enduring relationship. Rates are particularly low for Black and Native American/ Alaskan Native youth. Most enduring relationships have characteristics of strong ties—most are with family members and peers who provide multiple types of social support.

An Exploration of Sex Trading for Compensation and LGBTQ+ Inclusive Screening Practices: Perspectives of Young People who have Experienced Sex Trading and/or Homelessness,"Gerassi, L.B.; Cruys, C.; Hendry, N.; del Carmen Rosales, M.","Young people's perspectives on social and healthcare providers’ assessments of sex trading for financial compensation are lacking. This is particularly important for LGBTQ+ youth who experience substantial barriers in navigating health and social services. Further, increased internet access (because of COVID-19 and other factors) has changed the landscape of the sex trades in ways that are not fully understood. Our study aimed to understand (1) how young people trade sex, and (2) provider strategies that increase youths’ comfort in disclosing sex trading and related risks. This community-based participatory research study surveyed currently or formerly homeless youth (ages 16–29). We co-created a cross sectional survey that explored youths’ perceptions of: (1) sex trading type, compensation, and meaning; and (2) practices to increase youths’ comfort in disclosing sex trading. Participants (N = 103; Mage = 22.9 [SD = 3.5]; 34% white, 55% ciswomen/21% trans; 51% queer) reported that “sex trading” signified multiple meanings, ranging from sex work/occupation to exploitation/trafficking, and included diverse in-person and virtual forms for varied compensation types. Youth reported being more comfortable disclosing when the provider indicated they would advocate for them if they are victims of discrimination. Compared to cisgender youth, trans youth reported feeling significantly more comfortable disclosing sexual activity when a service provider used gender/sexuality inclusive practices (e.g., pronoun pins). Findings suggest important implications for gender-inclusive practice strategies to ultimately reduce potential harms of sex trading and multi-item measures to assess the complexity of sex trading. © 2023 The Authors",2024,,Child.

Review of the Literature on the Intersection of LGBTQ Youth and CSEC: More Than a Monolith,"Georges, E.","Purpose of Review: This review article delves into the critical issue of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), focusing on the intersection of CSEC with LGBTQ youth. It aims to shed light on the unique vulnerabilities faced by sexual minorities (SM) and transgender/gender diverse youth (TGD), challenging the tendency to homogenize the experiences of all sexual and gender minorities. Recent Findings: The review reveals that LGBTQ youth, especially TGD individuals, are disproportionately affected by CSEC and have unique risk factors, including the causes homelessness, polyvictimization based on sexual and gender identities, and barriers to utilizing shelters and gaining employment. The review also highlights unique areas for potential prevention and resilience that is also unique within subsets of the LGBTQ community, including living authentically, accessing GAC with gender-affirming providers, and finding families of other LGBTQ peers who accept them. Summary: This comprehensive review underscores the complexity of the intersection between LGBTQ youth and CSEC. By highlighting the unique vulnerabilities of sexual minorities and transgender/gender diverse youth, the review emphasizes the need to move beyond a broad understanding of the LGBTQ experience. It points out the gaps in current literature and the urgent need for targeted research to better comprehend the intricacies of CSEC risk factors and resilience mechanisms within these populations. Ultimately, the review urges for inclusive and targeted interventions to safeguard LGBTQ youth from the devastating impacts of commercial sexual exploitation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Curr Pediatr Rep,11,4,105-115,,10.1007/s40124-023-00302-6,,#428,Georges 2023,,

I find that the cross-party emphasis on data collection as a predicate for action on LGBT homelessness enables the Conservatives to signal sexual progress without risking the Party’s traditional supporters. Moreover, the almost exclusive focus on LGBT homeless youth in the parliamentary discourse, which is echoed to a lesser degree in existing research, stabilises divisions of ‘deserving/undeserving’ poor and entrenches the relationship between housing security, normative forms of intimacy and anti-migrant nationalist sentiments. To escape the terms of its current emergence, I argue, a coalitional and grass-roots-led definition of the problem of LGBT homelessness is needed. © 2022 The Author(s).

Hair Collection for Cortisol among Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Ford, J.L.; Slesnick, N.; Kelleher, K.; Brakenhoff, B.; Chavez, L.; Feng, X.; Mallory, A.; Moore, L.; O'Connor, R.; Pinkus, L.; Sullenbarger, B.; Yilmazer, T.; Zavarella, H.","Background Investigations of chronic physiological stress measured by hair cortisol are rapidly expanding among community samples of adolescents and adults. However, research examining physiological stress among youth experiencing homelessness is nascent despite the youth's increased risk for adverse exposures and subsequent impaired mental health. Objective This article aimed to examine the feasibility of collecting hair for measuring cortisol among diverse youth experiencing homelessness and gain an understanding of variation in participation. Methods Analysis of survey and hair participation data from three pilot studies among youth experiencing homelessness was conducted. Survey measures included sociodemographic characteristics (age, race and ethnicity, sex assigned at birth, and sexual orientation) and reasons for nonparticipation. Descriptive analysis examined participation rates in hair collection for cortisol measurement, including sociodemographic differences in participation. Results Participation in the hair sampling for cortisol was high for the combined sample (88.4%), with some variation across the three pilot studies. Insufficient hair for cutting was the most common reason for not participating; Black and multiracial youth, as well as male youth, had a higher prevalence of nonparticipation. Discussion The collection of hair for cortisol research among youth experiencing homelessness is feasible, and integration of physiological measures of stress into research with this vulnerable population should be considered, given their high risk for adversity and death by suicide and drug overdose. Methodological considerations and avenues for potential research are discussed. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",2023,,Nurs.

Experiences of pregnancy prevention among youth experiencing homelessness,"Eapen, D.J.; Bergh, R.; Lucas, S.; Narendorf, S.C.; Begun, S.; Santa Maria, D.","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at high risk for unintended pregnancy and face unique challenges to effectively preventing unintended pregnancy. This qualitative study explored the pregnancy prevention experiences of YEH. A total of 81 diverse youth participated in eight focus group discussions that were conducted to explore their perceptions and experiences related to pregnancy prevention. Youth were recruited from shelters, drop-in centers, and homeless-serving organizations in a large metropolitan area in the southern United States. Thematic content analysis of the data revealed that YEH struggle to engage in sexual and reproductive health services owing, in part, to limited accessibility. Lack of knowledge about contraceptives, perceived adverse side effects of contraceptives, and challenges with adherence to contraceptive methods significantly limited the effective use of contraception among YEH. Youths’ decisions to use contraception were influenced by their relationship status with partners, perceptions about the efficacy and side effects of contraceptives, and the stigma associated with contraceptive use. Providing sexual and reproductive health services to YEH requires a collaborative approach. YEH need comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and counseling that enables and empowers youth to access, navigate, and utilize such services. © 2023",2023,,Child. Youth Serv.

The world through my eyes: A photovoice project with youth experiencing homelessness,"Snow-Hill, N.L.; Asefnia, N.; Caldwell, D.M.; Avin, J.A.; Kloos, B.","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are infrequently included in the development, organization, and provision of homelessness-related services. This lack of youth voice and services tailored for their expressed needs can lead to underutilization of services, dissatisfaction, and poor outcomes. Photovoice, a participatory research method, has been used to empower persons from marginalized populations and to provide a platform for them to share their voices. This photovoice project partnered with six YEH (18-20 years old). Participants worked together, with the support of two group facilitators, to take photographs, identify themes, write narratives that best represented their lived experience, and share their concerns and ideas for the community. Photos and narratives were shared with decisionmakers at community-based showings. Attendees of the showings anecdotally reported having an increased awareness of YEH issues. The showings served as a catalyst in the community to address the challenges of YEH. Recommendations for research and practice are provided. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,J. Prev.

Correlates of Past Childhood Homelessness in a Nationally Representative Sample of US Adults,"Bommersbach, T.J.; Rhee, T.G.; Zhou, B.; Rosenheck, R.","Limited empirical data have been available on the adult sequelae of childhood homelessness. Using nationally representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, we compared a hierarchy of adults who were never homeless, those who were only homeless as children, and those who were homeless both as children and adults, hypothesizing greater adversity as one moved up the three-level hierarchy on sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifetime mental health diagnostic characteristics. As a further evaluation of the status of adults who were homeless as both children and adults, we compared this highest risk group to those who had been homeless only as adults. Individuals who experienced childhood homelessness were 46.9 times more likely than others to also experience adult homelessness. Testing the hierarchical hypothesis, compared with those who were never homeless, individuals who experienced homelessness only as children reported numerous associated disadvantages, including childhood sexual abuse/neglect, parental adversities, adult incarceration, psychiatric disorders, and low academic achievement/employment. Those reporting both child and adult homelessness, in contrast to childhood homelessness alone, additionally met the criteria for multiple substance use disorders, confirming our hierarchical hypothesis. Those reporting both child and adult homelessness also showed more numerous social and psychiatric problems when compared with those experiencing homelessness for the first time as adults. This study demonstrates how homelessness in childhood is associated with extensive social and psychiatric adversities in both childhood and adulthood.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Education as an effective strategy to promote nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in street children","Arabbadvi, Z.; Khoshnood, Z.; Foroughameri, G.; Mazallahi, M.","Background: Lack of nutritional knowledge and ineffective attitudes can complicate the problems faced by this group of street children and have significant effects on their behaviors. This study aimed to examine the effect of nutrition education on nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of street children in Kerman in 2021. Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 70 street children supported by Aftab Children Support Center in Kerman in 2021. The participants were selected using convenience sampling and were divided into two intervention and control groups using a random number table. A nutrition distance education program was implemented using an educational compact disk (CD) for the participants in the intervention group, while the children in the control group did not receive any training. The children’s nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were assessed before and one month after the intervention using the Nutritional Behavior Questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS software (version 22) using the chi-square test, paired and independent samples t-test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The results revealed a significant difference in nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors after the intervention (p < 0.001) due to the effect of the nutrition training program. Accordingly, the mean scores of the participants in the intervention group for nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors increased by 11.45, 14.80, and 6.05 units after the intervention compared to their scores before the intervention. Furthermore, the effects of the training program on the participants’ nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were 89.6%, 91.5%, and 64.3%, respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study concluded that training based on nutrition education improved the children’s nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, the officials in charge of promoting the health of vulnerable groups in the community need to provide the necessary facilities to implement effective training programs for street children and encourage them to participate in training programs. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,BMC Public Health,23,1,,,10.1186/s12889-023-15400-9,,#440,Arabbadvi 2023,,

We need to identify predictors of STI among youth in urban HIV epicenters. Methods Sexual and gender minority (gay, bisexual, transgender, gender-diverse) and other youth with multiple life stressors (homelessness, incarceration, substance use, mental health disorders) were recruited from 13 sites in Los Angeles and New Orleans (N = 1482). Self-reports and rapid diagnostic tests for STI, HIV, and drug use were conducted at 4-month intervals for up to 24 months. Machine learning was used to identify predictors of time until new STI (including a new HIV diagnosis). Results At recruitment, 23.9% of youth had a current or past STI. Over 24 months, 19.3% tested positive for a new STI. Heterosexual males had the lowest STI rate (12%); African American youth were 23% more likely to acquire an STI compared with peers of other ethnicities. Time to STI was best predicted by attending group sex venues or parties, moderate but not high dating app use, and past STI and HIV seropositive status. Conclusions Sexually transmitted infections are concentrated among a subset of young people at highest risk. The best predictors of youth's risk are their sexual environments and networks.

Living apart after adoption or guardianship: Perspectives of adoptive parents and guardians,"Rolock, N.; White, K.; Blakey, J.M.; Ocasio, K.; Korsch-Williams, A.; Flanigan, C.; Bai, R.; Faulkner, M.; Marra, L.; Fong, R.","Background: For children who are not reunified with their biological family members, the child welfare system promotes legal permanence through adoption or guardianship. The intent of adoption and guardianship is a safe home where children develop familial relationships that last a lifetime. However, issues may arise that result in children or youth living apart (LA) from their families after adoption or guardianship. In this study, LA is defined as a youth living outside the home after adoption or guardianship for two weeks or longer because the youth was receiving treatment in a residential or hospital setting, in a juvenile justice setting, or became homeless or ran away from home. Objective: Using caregiver survey data, this study examined the following questions: (1) What is the prevalence of LA? (2) What are the risk and protective factors at child and family levels that are associated with LA? (3) What is the nature of the relationships between family members among those who have experienced LA? Participants and Setting: This study re-purposed data from surveys of adoptive parents and guardians of children formerly in foster care in four states (n = 2473). Methods: Data were collected concurrently, and analyzed through an explanatory sequential mixed methods design began with determining prevalence rates and logistic regression to explore risk and protective factors for LA. This was followed by an examination of survey responses from a subsample of children who experienced LA to provide a deeper understanding of family relationships. Results: 8% of respondents experienced LA. Regression findings: kinship (OR = 0.57), higher family income (OR = 0.89), and engagement in extracurricular activities (OR = 0.37) served as protective factors for LA. Two elements of relationships were identified: Reciprocal, nurturing connections, which enhanced familial relationships and unfulfilled, unsupported connections that strained familial relationships. Conclusions: This study expands our understanding of the challenges faced by adoptive and guardianship families. Key findings include the importance of extracurricular school-related involvement, biological family support, and adoption or guardianship specific services. © 2023",2023,,Child. Youth Serv.

Music as symbolic action,"Graham, P.; Ward, A.","The aim of this paper is to describe and exemplify a theoretical perspective for the analysis of music as symbolic action in critical studies of discourse. We use deployments of music by legislatures in Australia, the UK, and the USA as exemplar cases to develop foundations for a critical, non-semiotic perspective that sees music work as gestalt complexes of physical and cultural forces that move people towards or away from specific actions and attitudes. In presenting our perspective we critique some semiotic assertions about music that are commonplaces in discourse studies and elsewhere.

Heterogeneous trajectories of suicidal ideation among homeless youth: Predictors and suicide-related outcomes,"Wu, Q.; Zhang, J.; Walsh, L.; Slesnick, N.","The current study examined heterogeneous trajectories of suicidal ideation among homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation over 9 months in a randomized controlled intervention study. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their suicidal ideation four times during a 9-month period. We also assessed pretreatment mental health, demographic information and session attendance as predictors of the subgroups, as well as suicide-related factors as outcomes at the 9-month follow-up. Growth mixture models suggested three distinct trajectory groups among youth: Fast Declining (74.7%), Chronic (19.3%), and Steadily Declining (6.0%). Youth in the Chronic group used more substances at baseline than the Steadily Declining group, were more likely to be White, non-Hispanic than the Fast Declining group, and attended more CTSP sessions than other groups. Contrastingly, youth in the Steadily Declining group all experienced childhood abuse. Finally, youth in the Chronic group showed significant higher risk for future suicide compared to those in the Fast Declining group at 9 months. Findings support the heterogeneity of treatment responses in suicide intervention among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts in this very high-risk population.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Improving access to housing and supportive services for runaway and homeless youth: Reducing vulnerability to human trafficking in New York City,"Kaya, Y.B.; Maass, K.L.; Dimas, G.L.; Konrad, R.; Trapp, A.C.; Dank, M.","Recent estimates indicate that there are over a million runaway and homeless youth and young adults (RHY) in the United States (US). Exposure to trauma, violence, and substance abuse, coupled with a lack of community support services, puts homeless youth at high risk of being exploited and trafficked. Although access to safe housing and supportive services such as physical and mental healthcare is an effective response to the vulnerability of RHY towards being trafficked, the number of youth experiencing homelessness exceeds the capacity of available housing resources in most US communities. We undertake a RHY-informed, systematic, and data-driven approach to project the collective capacity required by service providers to adequately meet the needs of RHY in New York City, including those most at risk of being trafficked. Our approach involves an integer linear programming model that extends the multiple multidimensional knapsack problem and is informed by partnerships with key stakeholders. The mathematical model allows for time-dependent allocation and capacity expansion, while incorporating stochastic youth arrivals and length of stays, services provided in a periodic fashion, and service delivery time windows.

Those randomized to receive enhanced services all received regular outreach from a youth specialist and could choose to participate in a mentoring and job readiness programs. Although less than a third of eligible youth fully completed either formal program, youth in the enhanced services condition had significantly fewer arrests, lower delinquency, and increased hours of employment.

A scoping review of housing stabilization interventions for youth experiencing homelessness,"de Pass, T.; Dada, O.; Lund, J.; John, J.; Kidd, S.A.","This scoping review synthesized the academic literature within North America that focuses on housing stabilization interventions for young people experiencing homelessness. A scoping review method was used to identify literature relevant to the question: What is the existing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature regarding housing stabilization interventions for youth who have experienced homelessness? The databases of PubMed, Scopus, PsychInfo and Google Scholar were searched, identifying 31 papers that were selected for the review. Three housing stabilization themes were identified, which included: 1) Multidisciplinary and outreach interventions, 2) Housing first models and 3) Transitional, Supportive and Independent Living programs. Results indicated improvements in housing stability among youth across types of housing stabilization interventions as well as promising impacts in areas of mental health, addictions, employment, education, and independent living skills. The evidence base, however, is limited, highlighting a need for future research to include more pragmatic design and examine what works best for who and when. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child.

Youth Homelessness and Type-2 Fuzzy Sets,"Mordeson, J.N.; Mathew, S.; Gayathri, G.","The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encourage countries to solve many social problems. One of these problems is homelessness. We rank states in the United States with respect to youth homelessness and the achievement of these goals. We use fuzzy similarity measures to determine the degree of similarity between these rankings. Given a similarity measure between two categories, we introduce a method using type-2 fuzzy sets that determines a similarity of a subcategory of one category with the other category. In particular, given a similarity measure between youth homelessness and the SDGs, we determine a similarity measure between youth vulnerable to toxic stress and the SDGs and also youth vulnerable to human trafficking and the SDGs. We also use a relatively new similarity measure, an n-dimensional similarity measure.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2023,,New Math. Nat.

Community- and data-driven homelessness prevention and service delivery: optimizing for equity,"Kube, A.R.; Das, S.; Fowler, P.J.","Objective: The study tests a community- and data-driven approach to homelessness prevention. Federal policies call for efficient and equitable local responses to homelessness. However, the overwhelming demand for limited homeless assistance is challenging without empirically supported decision-making tools and raises questions of whom to serve with scarce resources. Materials and Methods: System-wide administrative records capture the delivery of an array of homeless services (prevention, shelter, short-term housing, supportive housing) and whether households reenter the system within 2 years. Counterfactual machine learning identifies which service most likely prevents reentry for each household. Based on community input, predictions are aggregated for subpopulations of interest (race/ethnicity, gender, families, youth, and health conditions) to generate transparent prioritization rules for whom to serve first. Simulations of households entering the system during the study period evaluate whether reallocating services based on prioritization rules compared with services-as-usual. Results: Homelessness prevention benefited households who could access it, while differential effects exist for homeless households that partially align with community interests. Households with comorbid health conditions avoid homelessness most when provided longer-term supportive housing, and families with children fare best in short-term rentals. No additional differential effects existed for intersectional subgroups. Prioritization rules reduce community-wide homelessness in simulations. Moreover, prioritization mitigated observed reentry disparities for female and unaccompanied youth without excluding Black and families with children. Discussion: Leveraging administrative records with machine learning supplements local decision-making and enables ongoing evaluation of data- and equity-driven homeless services. Conclusions: Community- and data-driven prioritization rules more equitably target scarce homeless resources.  © 2023 The Author(s).

The elusiveness of home and ontological security among homeless youth,"Skobba, K.","The concept of home is connected to various psychosocial aspects of ontological security, encompassing safety, control, privacy, continuity, and permanence. However, for youth who have experienced homelessness, these positive attributes of home and the conditions necessary for ontological security remain elusive. This qualitative study utilised biographical interview data to explore the experiences of 26 young adults who experienced homelessness at least once during their time in high school. Using the concepts of ontological security, the meaning of home, and a social harm perspective, this research examined how the experience of homelessness affects the well-being of youth and builds upon the literature examining health, home, and well-being through the lens of social harm. For the participants in this study, the conditions essential for ontological security were unmet for prolonged periods during adolescence. Instead, they described frequently moving among temporary housing and households that sometimes felt unwelcoming and uncomfortable. The findings suggest that solutions to homelessness would require a fundamental shift in the U.S.’s political and economic systems, which, despite increasing inequality and limited housing options for vulnerable populations, may be challenging to achieve. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Int.

The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment was used to assess self-perceptions of relationships with parents and peers, and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure was used to assess engagement in resilience resources. Higher levels of attachment with parental figures were associated with increased engagement in seeking support from others (relational resilience), while higher levels of peer attachment were associated with higher levels of engagement in personal coping (individual resilience), such as locus of control, and of environmental resources (contextual resilience), such as the use of community and spiritual resources.

“I feel like a kid again”: the voices of youth experiencing homelessness in a mobile recreation program,"Crook, R.; Costas-Bradstreet, C.; Spence, J.C.; Tamminen, K.; van Ingen, C.; Hopper, T.D.","Youth homelessness is at an all-time high in Canada and is a complex social issue. The vast majority of interventions and research focuses on addressing the immediate needs of people experiencing homelessness, such as housing, harm reduction (due to substance use, violence, and crime) food security, and illness. The important role that recreation, sport, and physical activity play in the lives of youth is well established, however, the experiences of homeless youth in these spaces are relatively unknown. Thus, in partnership with a not-for-profit organisation and emergency youth shelters, this research study explored homeless youths’ experience of participating in a mobile recreation-based program and how this experience impacted their everyday lives. Ten youth currently residing in emergency shelters who participated in the program engaged in either one-on-one or group interviews. A qualitative content analysis approach was employed and three key themes were identified: (1) creating safe social spaces and cultivating relationships, (2) reconnecting to previous passions and meaning, and (3) promoting wellness. Findings suggest that the recreation program provided unique and layered experiences for the youth participants and had profound impacts on their overall wellbeing.

Fifty-five articles were included in the review. Findings demonstrated that fears of violence and other forms of harm were prominent concerns for people experiencing homelessness when accessing shelters. Service users’ perceptions of shelter dangerousness were shaped by the service model and environment, interpersonal relationships and interactions in shelter, availability of drugs, and previous living arrangements. 2SLGBTQ+ individuals were identified as being at heightened risk of victimization in shelters. No studies examined rates of shelter-based victimization or tested interventions to improve safety, with the exception of overdose risk.

Measuring Preservice Teacher Knowledge and Attitudes to Support Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Havlik, S.; Weins, P.; Ghafoori, A.; Jacobwitz, M.; Sheback, K.-J.; Hudson, H.","While many teachers are unaware that students in their classes are experiencing homelessness, others may not know how to support students who are identified as lacking consistent housing (Wright et al., 2019). Thus, there is a critical need to better assess, understand, and enhance teachers’ knowledge and attitudes toward homelessness. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is threefold—researchers sought to 1) design and test a survey to measure the knowledge and attitudes of preservice teachers working with youth experiencing homelessness; 2) measure the knowledge and attitudes of preservice teachers related to homelessness; and 3) measure the effectiveness of a virtual training program designed to enhance preservice teachers’ knowledge and attitudes toward homelessness using the finalized survey. Results of the data analysis were promising—indicating that the Knowledge and Attitudes on Homelessness Survey for Educators (KAHS) instrument is a reliable tool in measuring knowledge and attitudes related to homelessness and the online training program has a positive impact on teachers’ knowledge and attitudes. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2023,,J.

(Re)assembling the Self: Homeless Young People’s Identity Journeys and the Search for Ontological Security,"Mayock, P.","Homelessness is frequently assumed to be a fixed state that suspends people in time and space as they enter into contexts and environments where they struggle to exert control over their lives and their futures. Furthermore, a multitude of negative identities are ascribed to people who are homeless based on their lack of stable housing. A growing literature has contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the identity “work” engaged in by youth who experience homelessness. Nonetheless, most studies have examined the construction of identity cross-sectionally; in many cases, exclusively or primarily through the lens of youths’ experience of street and shelter life. Additionally, while the home has long since been argued to provide a secure base around which identities are constructed and ontological security attained, the intersection of identity with ontological security has, hitherto, not been adequately addressed within the youth homelessness literature. This paper examines the identity journeys of homeless young people based on selected findings from a six-year biographical longitudinal study of homeless youth in Dublin, Ireland. The analysis—which is organised according to the themes of rupture, the interruption of trust, and the (re)assembling of self—builds on existing studies by engaging with the concept of ontological security alongside an examination of young people’s accounts of, and reflections on, their journeys through and, in some cases, out of homelessness. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of understanding the identity stories of homeless youth through longitudinal biographical narration and addresses the policy implications arising from the findings presented. © 2023 The Child Care in Practice Group.",2023,,Child Care Pract.,29,3,297-318,,10.1080/13575279.2023.2199191,,#491,Mayock 2023,,
Youth-centered Recommendations to Address Social Stigma and Discrimination Against Unhoused Youth: An Integrative Literature Review,"Le, H.; Rew, L.","Youth between ages 13 and 25 who experience homelessness face numerous barriers to excellent health, including social stigma and discrimination. Applying socio-ecological model and intersectionality theory, an integrative literature review was conducted. Peer-reviewed studies (N = 29) representing 808,296 participants extracted from four databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SocINDEX) were analyzed. The studies included sources of discrimination and stigma from interpersonal interactions with support services staff upwards to policy and systemic levels with housing and justice systems. Health outcomes include poorer physical and behavioral health status from increased likeliness of denied access to support services, prolonged time spent being homeless, and higher incidences of experiencing violence. School nursing has power to push for recommended changes and support unhoused youth towards excellent health.

This analysis sought to identify factors associated with MMT discontinuation among AYA. Method: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort study of street-involved AYA in Vancouver, Canada, between December 2005 and June 2018. Multivariable extended Cox regression identified factors associated with time to MMT discontinuation among AYA who recently initiated MMT. In subanalysis, multivariable extended Cox regression analysis identified factors associated with time to “actionable” MMT discontinuation, which could be addressed through policy changes. Results: A total of 308 participants reported recent MMT during the study period. Participants were excluded if they reported MMT in the past 6 months at baseline and were retained in MMT (n = 94, 30.5%); were missing MMT status data (n = 43, 14.0%); or completed an MMT taper (n = 11, 3.6%). Of the remaining 160 participants who initiated MMT over the study period, 102 (63.8%) discontinued MMT accounting for 119 unique discontinuation events. In multivariable extended Cox regression, MMT discontinuation was positively associated with recent weekly crystal methamphetamine use (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19 to 2.35), but negatively associated with age of first “hard” drug use (per year older) (AHR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) and female sex (AHR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.99). In subanalysis, recent weekly crystal methamphetamine use (AHR = 4.61, 95% CI: 1.78 to 11.9) and weekly heroin or fentanyl use (AHR = 3.37, 95% CI: 1.21 to 9.38) were positively associated with “actionable” MMT discontinuation, while older age (AHR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.99) was negatively associated. Conclusions: Efforts to revise MMT programming; provide access to a range of MOUD, harm reduction, and treatments; and explore coprescribing stimulants to AYA with concurrent stimulant use may improve treatment retention and reduce toxic drug fatalities. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Can.

"A photovoice study of college students who have experienced foster care, relative care, and/or homelessness","S. Samarah, E.M.; Schelbe, L.; Jackson, L.A.","Purpose: Young people with a history of foster care and or homelessness experience barriers to education and often have poorer educational outcomes. Universities have established campus support programs (CSP) to address these student needs; however, there is limited knowledge about their experiences in CSP and in college. Method: We used photovoice methodology to elicit the perspectives of 18 undergraduate students in a CSP. Participants took pictures that addressed two guiding questions: What is it like to be a college student who experienced foster care, homelessness, relative care, or ward of the State status? What is it like to participate in a CSP? We interviewed participants about their photos and coded interview transcripts using an inductive, iterative approach. Results: Participants’ experiences in college were often impacted by their past. Participants disclosed that they often felt like outsiders on campus. Concerns of being misunderstood were accompanied by feelings of pressure to perform as role models for others. Resources provided by the CSP were identified as important as was the support and sense of community in being part of the CSP. Students appreciated having a designated space on campus where they could connect to other students with similar backgrounds. Consistently, participants stressed that the CSP improved their college experience and contributed to their successes. Discussion: Findings highlight the importance of CSP's holistic services and a sense of community. By supporting students, CSPs can create spaces in which students who disproportionately have been excluded from higher education feel welcome and able to overcome adversity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child.

What Does it Mean to be Homeless? How Definitions Affect Homelessness Policy,"Sullivan, A.A.","Government agencies use varying criteria in defining homelessness. While scholars debate over and use different definitions of homelessness, little research has explored the impacts the definition has on perceived problem severity and the types of communities receiving aid. I first explore four definitions of child and youth homelessness used by United States’ federal agencies. I then use panel data for school districts, which report homelessness by subgroup, to analyze how the definition of homelessness changes its prevalence and leads to disparate impacts. I find the definition of homelessness including students living doubled-up leads to a higher growth rate. Definitions also change which districts have high rates of homelessness and characteristics of these districts, suggesting resources following students experiencing homelessness go to different types of communities. Scholars should consider how a problem is defined, differences in the measurement used between studies, and how the definition affects where resources go. © The Author(s) 2022.",2023,,Urban Aff.

Hidden champions: Exploring supportive family relationships of youth experiencing homelessness,"Gallardo, K.R.; Narendorf, S.C.; Markham, C.M.; Swartz, M.D.; Santa Maria, D.","The relationships that youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) have with supportive family members (i.e. those who provide them with social support) may be protective against risk behaviours and buffer adverse health outcomes. However, little is known about the nature of YEH's supportive family relationships and the type of social support that these family relationships offer them. Thus, we conducted in-depth interviews with 30 YEH to examine the type of social support received from family relationships and to explore the social dynamics of these relationships. We found that many YEH not only continued to maintain relationships with family members after becoming homeless but also received emotional and/or instrumental support from these family members. Beyond providing this type of social support, family members served as a source of motivation for these youth. Additionally, YEH contributed to their family relationships and gained a sense of connectedness in return. Lastly, we found that YEH's family support was influenced by their family circumstances and their need for autonomy. Collectively, our findings suggest there may be a need for interventions designed to strengthen relationships with supportive family members among YEH, who may derive multiple positive benefits from relating with the ‘hidden champions’ in their lives. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2023,,Child Fam.

"Mental health and psychosocial interventions integrating sexual and reproductive rights and health, and HIV care and prevention for adolescents and young people (10–24 years) in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic scoping review","Musindo, O.; Jafry, S.; Nyamiobo, J.; Becker, K.D.; Gellatly, R.; Maloy, C.; Lozano-Ruiz, A.; Romero-Gonzalez, B.; Kola, L.; Merali, Z.; Chorpita, B.F.; Kumar, M.","Background: Interventions targeting combined sexual and reproductive health, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) management and mental health care in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are few. There is a need to address common determinants of poor mental, psychosocial and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) through multimodal and multipronged interventions for adolescents. The main objective of this study was to identify whether and how interventions targeting adolescent SRHR and HIV with a focus on pregnant and parenting adolescents in SSA include mental health components and how these components and their outcomes have been reported in the literature. Methods: We carried out a two process scoping review approach between 01.04.2021 and 23.08.2022. In the first stage, we searched the PubMed database to identify studies focusing on adolescents and young people aged 10 to 24 from 2001 to 2021. We identified studies focusing on HIV and SRHR that had mental health and psychosocial aspects to the interventions. Our search yielded 7025 studies. Of these 38 were eligible based on our screening criteria that covered interventions, and on further scrutiny, using PracticeWise, an established coding system, we identified select problems and practices to provide a more granular assessment of how interventions developed for this context mapped on to specific problems. At this second stage process, we selected 27 studies for inclusion as actual interventional designs for further systematic scoping of their findings and we used the Joanna Briggs Quality Appraisal checklist to rate these studies. This review was registered within the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42021234627. Findings: Our first set of findings is that when coding problems and solutions, mental health concerns were the least common category of problems targeted in these SRHR/HIV interventions; nevertheless, psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral strategies such as improved communication, assertiveness training, and informational support were offered widely. Of the 27 interventional studies included in the final review, 17 RCTs, 7 open trials, and 3 mixed designs, represented nine countries of the 46 countries in SSA. Intervention types included peer, community, family, digital, and mixed modality interventions. Eight interventions focused on caregivers and youth. Social or community ecology associated problems (being an orphan, sexual abuse, homelessness, negative cultural norms) were the most common risk factors and were more frequent than medical issues associated with HIV exposure. Our findings highlight the relevance and centrality of social issues related to adolescent mental and physical health along with the need to strengthen multimodal interventions along the lines of problems we have identified in our review. Interpretation: Combined interventions jointly addressing adolescent SRHR, HIV, and mental health have been relatively understudied, despite evidence that adverse social and community factors are rampant in this population.

"Prevalence and correlates of methamphetamine use in transitional age youth experiencing homelessness or housing instability in San Francisco, CA","Leonard, A.; Broussard, J.; Jain, J.; Kumar, S.; Santos, G.-M.; Dawson-Rose, C.","Introduction: Substance use, including methamphetamine use, is a contributing factor in HIV acquisition and treatment. Stimulant use is linked to mental health yet there is limited data from youth in community-based settings. Design: One hundred marginally housed or homeless transitional age youth (TAY) were recruited at Larkin Street Youth Services and completed a survey on mental health and substance use. Methods: We conducted secondary data analysis using multivariable logistic regression models to identify the correlates of methamphetamine use among TAY. Results: The participants’ mean age was 22. Of those who reported methamphetamine use in the past 3 months, 64% were Gay, Bisexual, or Pansexual. Factors independently associated with methamphetamine use were; living with HIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.11–9.15), depressive symptoms (aOR = 6.02, 95% CI = 1.46–24.78), symptoms of PTSD (aOR = 13.38, 95% CI = 1.59–112.73), polysubstance use in the past 3 months (aOR = 50.02, 95% CI = 9.72–257.46) and a history of injection drug use (aOR = 8.38, 95% CI = 1.87–37.53). Conclusions: Results from this study suggest a need to develop, adapt, and rapidly implement comprehensive interventions that address the combined epidemics of substance use, HIV, and mental health among TAY. Clinical Relevance: This article examines factors associated with methamphetamine use among transitional age youth (TAY) experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Several factors were associated with use, including depression, PTSD, HIV status, polysubstance use, and injection drug use. These findings highlight the need for nurses to assess for methamphetamine use among youth as well as associated mental health and physical health problems.

Findings from a Survey in Six Major Cities,"Vameghi, M.; Roshanfekr, P.; Ghaedamini Harouni, G.; Takaffoli, M.; Bahrami, G.","Street children are among the most marginalized children, globally, who experience severe violations of their rights and face multiple deprivations. This study aimed to describe street children’s characteristics and working conditions in Iran. Method: This cross-sectional rapid survey was conducted from March to May 2017 in six major cities in Iran. The sample group consisted of Iranian and non-Iranian girls and boys, aged 10 to 18, who worked on the streets for at least one month prior to the survey. Time–location based sampling was used. A total of 856 Children were randomly selected from 464 venues, including corners of streets, parks, metro gates, bus stations, shopping malls, and shopping centers frequented by street children. Results: Findings showed that 90% of participants were boys, 60% were between 10 and 14 years old, almost 50% attended school, 12% were illiterate, and 32% had quit school. Children of Afghan nationality comprised 54% of the study participants, and the rest were Iranian. Of all participants, 85% resided with family or relatives. Most children (75.5%) worked more than 5 h daily, and vending (71.2%) and waste picking (16.1%) were common activities. Street children suffered, mainly, from harsh weather (22.7%), insults and beatings of everyday people (21%), starvation (20.7%), and police repression (15.4%). More than half of the study participants were not involved in intervention programs, and just 7% of them had attended any health education programs.

The Global Distribution and Epidemiology of Psychoactive Substance Use and Injection Drug Use Among Street-Involved Children and Youth: A Meta-Analysis,"Armoon, B.; Griffiths, M.D.; Mohammadi, R.","Background: Globally, street-involved children and youth (SICY) who work and live on/of the streets are at higher risk of increased psychoactive substances and injecting drug use. Objectives: The present study aimed to identify the prevalence, distribution, sociodemographic factors, and risk-taking behaviors associated with psychoactive substances and injecting drug use among SICY. Methods: Studies in English published from December 1 1985 to July 1 2022, were searched for on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science to identify primary studies on psychoactive substances and injecting drug use among SICY. The pooled-prevalence estimates were obtained using a robust fixed-effects model. Results: The most commonly reported life-time and current psychoactive substance was tobacco followed by cannabis, LSD/ecstasy, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and injection drug use. The results showed that life-time and current prevalence of methamphetamine and cannabis use, as well as life-time prevalence of cocaine, LSD/ecstasy, heroin, tobacco, and injecting drug use increased as age rose while current prevalence of cocaine and tobacco use decreased as age rose. SICY who were male, homeless, had parents who had died, had history of substance use among family members or best friends, had experienced violence, had casual sex partners, had a history of working in the sex trade, and had unprotected sex were all related to psychoactive substance use and injecting drug use. Conclusions: Research examining this population suffers from lack of studies, therefore, improving the knowledge for interventions aimed at reducing risk behaviors, particularly those related to the transmission of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV is of great importance. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2023,,Subst.

"Analysis of factors related to the resilience of street children in Surabaya City, Indonesia","Fitryasari, R.; Nihayati, H.E.; Yusuf, A.; Islamiyah, T.; Hikmawati, S.I.; Ayu, E.Q.; Agustin, R.; Ching-Lan Lin, E.","Objectives: The inability to adapt to difficult and stressful situations in the environment leads to low resilience ability in street children. Knowing the influencing factors is important to help them achieve optimal resilience. This study aims to analyze the relationship between factors related to street children's resilience. Methods: This study used a correlational design with a cross-sectional approach. The population was street children in two halfway-home in Surabaya (Kampung Anak Negeri and Sanggar Alang-Alang). The sample was 129 respondents obtained using simple random sampling. The independent variables were unpleasant past experience, antisocial behavior, level of depression, age, sex, length of time being street children and positive support. The dependent variable was resilience. Data were collected using questionnaires and analyzed by Spearman Rho-test with p<0.05. Results: The result showed, that unpleasant past experiences (p=0.00 and r= -0.313), level of depression (p=0.00 and r= -0.279) and positive support have an association with resilience (p=0.000 and r=0.331). The lowest unpleasant past experiences and depression levels and the higher positive support will make higher resiliency in street children. Conclusions: This study has explained the unpleasant past experiences and depression levels as risk factors and the positive support as a supportive factor for street children's resilience.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",2023,,Int.

Addressing Child Sexual Abuse: A Call to Action for Providers in Latin America,"Casas-Muñoz, A.; Carranza-Neira, J.; Intebi, I.; Lidchi, V.; Eisenstein, E.; Greenbaum, J.","The objective of this communication is to outline the key elements required to train health care providers in various occupations (medicine, psychology, dentistry, nursing, social work, nutrition, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chemistry, pharmacy, and obstetrics, including midwifery, among others) to address child sexual abuse (CSA) and develop care protocols grounded on evidence-based practices, as well as provide resources to optimize both processes. Training on child and adolescent sexual abuse is an essential component of facing this major challenge in Latin America and allowing health care personnel to fulfill their role of safeguarding the security and well-being of children and adolescents. Developing protocols helps health care staff define the roles and responsibilities of individual members, summarize potential red flags of CSA, and describe strategies to best identify and address the health and safety needs of patients and their families, which should include a trauma-informed approach. Future work should focus on developing and evaluating new strategies to increase the capacity of the health sector to care for children experiencing CSA and optimizing ways to train staff. Further aims should also include improving research and evidence generation on the epidemiology and care of CSA in Latin America, including of male children and adolescents, minorities, and priority groups (e.g., migrant children, children with disabilities, street children, youth deprived of liberty, indigenous communities and the LGBTQI+ community). © 2023 Pan American Health Organization.

Healthcare Use and Case Characteristics of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children: Teen Victims Versus High-Risk Teens,"Hornor, G.; Hollar, J.; Landers, T.; Sherfield, J.","Introduction The overall goal of this study was to provide further information about the characteristics of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) victims by comparing the characteristics of a known victim pool to high-risk patients identified. The specific objectives of this study were to describe patient demographic characteristics, pediatric healthcare use, familial psychosocial characteristics, and child sexual abuse case characteristics present in youth identified as high risk for CSEC victimization compared with a sample of known victims. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting to the emergency department or Child Advocacy Center for a concern of sexual abuse/assault at a midwestern U.S. academic pediatric medical center. Adolescents aged 12-21 years were included in the study. Results In the current study, multiple CSEC risk factors were noted to increase odds for CSEC victimization: homelessness or life on the streets, runaway behavior, living with mother only, placement in a juvenile detention center, placement in a residential treatment center or group home, and number of living arrangements (four or greater). Multiple elements of high-risk sexual behavior increased odds of CSEC victimization: legally age-inappropriate sex, gonorrhea diagnosis, trichomonas diagnosis, other sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses, number of STIs, and chlamydia diagnosis. Discussion These findings suggest that age of sexual partners and number and types of STIs are associated with CSEC and should be validated in other groups. In addition, these data suggest that use of cocaine and opiates could serve as an important, yet underrecognized, risk factor.  © Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",2023,,J.

Barefoot entrepreneurs trapped in liminal spaces: the case of homeless youths in New York City,"Doussard, C.; Billion, J.; Renouf, J.; Bureau, S.","The barefoot entrepreneurship literature rarely acknowledges the role of space in the development of informal economic activities. However, the concept of liminal space, defined as a place of transition and largely discussed in geography, can provide a new conceptual lens through which the trajectories of barefoot entrepreneurs can be viewed. This interdisciplinary research leverages this perspective to raise the following question: How do barefoot entrepreneurs experience liminal spaces to engage in informal economic activities? To answer this question, this article explores how 10 homeless youths in New York City panhandle, steal, deal and prostitute themselves to survive. Drawing on a four-year ethnography and the use of geographic methods, we explain how these barefoot entrepreneurs experience liminal spaces. More precisely, we underline how these spaces are ambivalent places of becoming: on the one hand, they support the development of barefoot entrepreneurship; but on the other hand, they lead to ‘entrepreneurial traps’ in the sense that these activities tend to increase the entrepreneurs’ marginality. Based on these results, we contribute to the literature on barefoot entrepreneurship, and to a better understanding of the implication of liminal spaces in entrepreneurial dynamics. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Entrep.

"Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse reflected in Self-Figure drawings of Indian street children","Girish, M.; Lev-Wiesel, R.; Bhattacharyya, A.; Binson, B.","The present mixed-methods study aims to understand the extent to which emotional, physical and sexual abuse is reflected in the Self-Figure drawings of Indian street children by identifying pictorial indicators unique to each form of abuse. Following ethical approval and informed consent, 357 children across different states residing in shelter homes with a background of abuse were asked to draw themselves, complete the Medical Somatic Dissociation Questionnaire (MSDQ) and a life events scale in their regional language. Based on the rating of two art therapists on the level of obviousness, pictorial characteristics belonging to the specific form of abuse were ascertained. Results showed that nose, forehead and cheek/chin were significantly profound for physical and sexual abuse whereas eyes, arms/hands and genital area stood out for emotional abuse (p < 0.001). Significantly low somatization and depression were seen for emotional abuse (p < 0.001). Positive correlation was seen between MSDQ subscales of somatization, depression, total MSDQ score and indicators of forehead and cheek/chin (p < 0.01). Depression and total MSDQ score had a positive correlation with the indicator of ears. These differences reflected in the drawings can assist professionals in screening abused children reluctant to disclose aiding assessment and intervention. © 2022",2023,,Arts Psychother.,82,,,,10.1016/j.aip.2022.101986,,#529,Girish 2023,,
Exploring the socialization of homeless children in Czechia: sibling relationships,"Mikulcová, K.; Kowaliková, I.; Caletková, L.; Racko, V.M.; Mikulec, M.","The paper aims to describe the specific context of the homeless children’s living environment and to show the consequences that this context has on the sibling relationships of homeless children in Czechia. The text is based on a psychosocial perspective. The context of the space, where homeless children live strongly affects their socialisation. Sibling relationships, which are transformed in such an environment, become increasingly important. Using a qualitative research strategy, we carried out 30 sets of interviews with homeless parents and children (a total of 60 interviews). We found that the environment of homelessness alters sibling roles in the family, reinforces sibling closeness as a compensation for material deprivation, makes it more difficult for children to detach, escalates sibling conflicts, and generally reinforces a certain exclusivity in relationship. The results show that social work and other helping professions should focus on supporting sibling relationships in the homelessness environment. © 2023 The Author(s).

Homeless Shelter Use by Age and Community with Implications for the Cost of Maintaining City-Wide Systems of Emergency Shelters:A Comparison of Calgary andToronto,"Jadidzadeh, A.; Kneebone, R.","We use administrative data from Calgary and Toronto to tie together three key results from the literature on homeless shelter use. Those results are used to derive estimates of the cost of maintaining a community-wide system of homeless shelters. The three key results—that people experience sheltered homelessness in vastly different ways, that the experience varies by their age, and that these experiences vary by community—are shown by using comparable data collected over a common period of time and by applying common assumptions and methods to the treatment of those data. This approach allows us to test for statistically significant differences in how sheltered homelessness is experienced and so provides a set of results confirming how much the ways in which people experience sheltered homelessness are sensitive to their age and their location. Finally, we show how these differences matter for the cost of maintaining a community-wide system of emergency homeless shelters. Our results confirm that what may be an inexpensive solution to providing shelter in some locations and for some demographics is rather more expensive in another location and for a different demographic. The cost savings realized by shelter operators from housing those who were previously homelessness is also measured. © Canadian Public Policy / Analyse de politiques, 2023.

The role of polysubstance use on criminal justice involvement in the United States,"Jones, A.A.; Strong-Jones, S.; Apsley, H.B.","Purpose of reviewPolysubstance use, broadly defined as using more than one type of substance, disproportionately impacts those involved in the criminal justice system (CJS). This review synthesizes recent findings on polysubstance use among those involved in the CJS and highlights areas of particular concern and interventions.Recent findingsWe use 18 recent articles to identify the prevalence and types of criminal justice involvement and correlates of polysubstance use and criminal justice involvement. We highlight latent patterns of polysubstance use among various criminal justice populations (adults, pregnant women, and youth) and differential associations with adverse substance use and criminal justice outcomes. Lastly, we discuss substance use treatment in the justice system, the role of polysubstance use in treatment access and outcomes, and substance use-related services for previously incarcerated individuals reentering society.SummaryCurrent research provides further evidence of the syndemic nature of polysubstance use, criminal justice involvement, and adverse outcomes, which are complicated by significant barriers to accessing evidence-based treatment in justice settings. Yet, current research is limited due to methodological inconsistency and limited focus on the social determinants of health, racial/ethnic disparities, and interventions to increase treatment and reentry services.

Suicidality and Implicit Dependency in Child and Adolescent Inpatients With Histories of Trauma: Moderating Effect of Gender,"Szymanski, K.; Hartmann, V.; Springer, C.; Bornstein, R.","There is lack of empirical findings on a direct link between suicidality and dependency in youth. This is particularly relevant for children and adolescents with a trauma history, since traumatization is a well-established risk factor for suicidality in this population. Research on dependency predominantly uses self-report assessments, which may be susceptible to biases. In this study, performance-based interpersonal dependency scores in inpatient children and adolescents with trauma history were compared with patients' suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts) as derived from chart records. The results showed a gender effect. High dependency scores were associated with higher suicidal ideation for girls and with lower suicidal attempts for boys. These findings demonstrate that a relationship between dependency and suicidality for hospitalized traumatized youth is impacted by gender.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Housing First for Youth Intervention for Youth Experiencing Homelessness in Canada: Protocol for a Multisite, Mixed Methods Randomized Controlled Trial","Gaetz, S.; Bonakdar, A.; Ecker, J.; MacDonald, C.; Ilyniak, S.; Ward, A.; Kimura, L.; Vijayaratnam, A.; Banchani, E.","Background: Emerging evidence at the international level suggests that the Housing First approach could improve the housing stability of young people experiencing homelessness. However, there is a dearth of literature in Canada on whether the Housing First intervention for young people experiencing homelessness can improve outcomes including housing stability, health and well-being, and access to complementary supports. Adapted from the original Housing First model, Housing First for Youth (HF4Y) was developed in Canada as a rights-based approach tailored specifically for young people aged 16 to 24 years who are experiencing or are at risk of homelessness. Objective: The Making the Shift Youth Homelessness Social Innovation Lab is testing the effectiveness of the HF4Y intervention in Canada. The objective of this study is to determine whether the HF4Y model results in better participant-level outcomes than treatment-as-usual services for young people experiencing homelessness in 2 urban settings: Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario. Primary outcomes include housing stability, health and well-being, and complementary supports, and secondary outcomes include employment and educational attainment and social inclusion. Methods: The HF4Y study used a multisite, mixed methods, randomized controlled trial research approach for data collection and analysis. Eligible participants included young people aged 16 to 24 years who were experiencing homelessness or housing precarity. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment-as-usual group or the housing first intervention group. Survey and interview data in Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario are being collected at multiple time points (3-6 months) over 4 years to capture a range of outcomes. Analytic strategies for quantitative data will include mixed-effects modeling for repeated measures and logistic models. A thematic analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data based on participants’ narratives and life journeys through homelessness. Furthermore, program fidelity evaluations are conducted within each HF4Y program. These evaluations assess how well the intervention aligns with the HF4Y model and identify any areas that may require adjustments or additional support. Results: The HF4Y study has received human participant research ethics approval from the Office of Research Ethics at York University. Recruitment was conducted between February 2018 and March 2020. Data collection is expected to be completed at both sites by March 2024. A preliminary analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data collected between baseline and 24 months is underway. Conclusions: This pilot randomized controlled trial is the first to test the effectiveness of the HF4Y intervention in Canada. The findings of this study will enhance our understanding of how to effectively deliver and scale up the HF4Y intervention, with the aim of continually improving the HF4Y model to promote better outcomes for youth. © 2023 JMIR Publications Inc..",2023,,JMIR Res.

Trans death at Rikers Island: sites of (in)visibility and reframing mass incarceration,"Montano, N.","On June 7th, 2019, Layleen Xtravaganza Cubilette-Polanco, a transgender woman from New York, died at Rikers Island while in solitary confinement. According to officials from the Department of Corrections, Layleen’s death was a result of a series of interrelated health problems. Trans, queer, and gender non-conforming people, especially youth of colour and Black trans women, face heightened rates of homelessness, violent victimisation, barriers to housing, employment, and healthcare. These social conditions are tied to heightened engagement in survival sex work, over-policing, and surveillance of their communities. As a result, Trans and queer people are disproportionately impacted by mass incarceration, and must contend with the nexus of a system that functions on racist and colonial legal construction of gender, making carceral spaces sites of (in)visibility and death. The death of Trans people within these carceral spaces are followed by multiple discursive deaths, including the use of dead names in media, misgendering, and transphobic political debate. This paper aims to highlight and explore carceral settings as sites of death and (in)visbility for Trans and queer people and how reframing allows us to identify how (neo)liberal reforms meant to protect Trans people only entrench mass incarceration in the United States. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Mortality,28,2,284-298,,10.1080/13576275.2023.2178292,,#536,Montano 2023,,
The Transition to Adulthood of Dual-System Youth in Quebec: A Focus on High School Graduation and Housing Situation,"Dumollard, M.; Gauthier-Davies, C.; Goyette, M.; Blanchet, A.","This article examines two outcomes of the transition to adulthood for youth who are involved with both the child protection and juvenile justice systems, known as dual-system youth. Data from a longitudinal study conducted in Quebec between 2017 and 2021 with 1136 youth in care suggest that dual-system youth are less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to experience housing instability and homelessness than are youth who have been in child protection alone. The article demonstrates that the differences between the two groups are far from anecdotal. The potential interactions of these results with the youth’s interpersonal support network are also examined. Finally, this article paints a bleaker picture of the situations dual-system youth experience during the transition to adulthood. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on the outcomes of the transition to adulthood to design socio-legal actions that can better prepare dual-system youth for this stage of their lives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Child Adolesc.

The present study used participatory qualitative methods, specifically a photovoice project with young people (N = 8) experiencing homelessness or housing instability, to understand their experiences of being in a relationship with a peer support specialist. This study found that young people experiencing homelessness or housing instability experienced peer relationships as uniquely caring and affirming. Young people described peers as “feeling like a friend” and repeatedly expressed that peer support is “deeper than therapy.” This sort of support stands in contrast to many conventional service approaches, which tend to be driven by organizational agendas and outcomes leading young people to disaffiliate from services.

Geographies of Hegemonic Gay Masculinity: Interplays of Trans and Racialized In/Exclusions in the Gay Village of Toronto,"Rosenberg, R.D.","Little geographical work has explored the role of hegemonic gay masculinity in constructing queer spaces and its impacts on multiply marginalized lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, and additional (LGBTQ2+) people. Building on interviews with LGBTQ2+ youth experiencing homelessness, and photographs taken by them, this article investigates how hegemonic gay masculinity materializes in visual representations of gendered bodies throughout Toronto’s gay village, and how this is reflected in feminine and trans or gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth’s social experiences of the neighborhood. Through a framework of hegemonic masculinity, gender and race are understood as co-constitutive and read simultaneously in the queer geographical productions of gendered inclusions and exclusions among LGBTQ2+ youth experiencing homelessness. This article analyzes how hegemonic gay masculinity links queer spaces to various structures of power through visual cultures, including whiteness, cisnormativity, nationalism, and able-bodiedness, and the implications of this in the everyday social relations of feminine and TGNC youth experiencing homelessness. Through this exploration, this article presents how visual representations of gendered bodies communicate hegemonic masculinity in built queer environments, instruct varying forms of gendered and racialized inclusions and exclusions, and (re)produce a sense of unbelonging for some of the most marginalized members of the LGBTQ2+ community.

Immunization Coverage in Young People Experiencing Homelessness and the Impact of a Nurse-led Program,"Tominc, B.L.; Francis, K.L.; Sawyer, S.M.; Heerde, J.A.; O’Neill, J.; Henning, D.","Objectives: To identify the proportion of young people experiencing homelessness who are immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases, and to evaluate the impact of a nurse-led immunization program to improve vaccination coverage in this population. Methods: A retrospective audit of electronic medical records included 400 participants aged 15 to 24 years who had an encounter with the Young People’s Health Service, a nurse-led clinic co-located with a specialist youth homelessness service in Melbourne, Australia, between February 2019 and May 2021. Results: Integrating an immunization nurse within a youth specialist homelessness service increased the percentage of young people who were up-to-date with routine vaccinations from 6.0% (n = 24) to 38.8% (n = 155). Intersecting social determinants of health that increased participants’ risk of vaccine preventable diseases, and of missing routine vaccines, were common. Conclusions: Incomplete coverage of routine vaccines is common in young people accessing homelessness services, and this coverage was improved when young people encountered an immunization nurse while accessing support from a specialist youth homelessness service. As a service model, nurse-led community health clinics co-located within homelessness providers can improve vaccination coverage, and therefore health outcomes, of young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,J.

The Association between Housing Stability and Perceived Quality of Life among Emerging Adults with a History of Homelessness,"Palimaru, A.I.; Mcdonald, K.; Garvey, R.; D'amico, E.J.; Tucker, J.S.","Many cities across the United States are experiencing homelessness at crisis levels, including rises in the number of unhoused emerging adults (18-25). Emerging adults experiencing homelessness may be at higher risk of experiencing negative outcomes, given that being unhoused increases risk for a variety of behaviors. To better understand the current living circumstances of emerging adults with a history of homelessness, as well as their perceptions about associations between housing stability and quality of life (QOL), we conducted 30 semistructured in-depth interviews with individuals recruited from drop-in centers for youth experiencing homelessness. At the time of recruitment, n = 19 were stably housed and n = 11 were unstably housed. Two coders analyzed these data inductively and deductively, using preidentified domains and open coding. Coding reliability was assessed. Three main themes emerged, each with subthemes: (1) housing quality (neighborhood safety, convenience, and housing unit characteristics); (2) QOL before stable housing (physical and mental wellbeing, social wellbeing, and other determinants of QOL, such as encounters with law enforcement); and (3) changes in QOL after stable housing (same subthemes as for prehousing stability QOL). Findings indicated a pattern of perceived relationships between housing stability, housing quality, built and social environments, and QOL in the context of emerging adults who experienced or continued to experience homelessness. However, results were mixed with regard to the perceived effects of housing stability on alcohol and other drug use. Taken together, results indicate several areas of challenge but also highlight opportunities to facilitate improvements in QOL among vulnerable emerging adults who experience homelessness. © 2023 RAND Corporation.",2023,,Health Soc.

Creating stories for impact: Co-producing knowledge with young people through story mapping,"van Blerk, L.; Hunter, J.; Shand, W.; Prazeres, L.","This paper explores co-production of knowledge for impact with young people through the process of creating digital story maps, drawing on co-produced research from two projects: with homeless youth in African cities; and with youth refugees in Uganda and Jordan. It examines the process of creating three story maps with the intention of enabling young people to co-produce knowledge exchange and research impact. Participants were able to engage in the latter stages of research as part of research analysis, outcomes and outputs beyond the temporal and spatial confines of data collection. The story maps were therefore used not only to ‘bring life’ to reports produced for stakeholders and funders, but also to take young people's research stories beyond locally bound contexts to reach a variety of global audiences. The reflections in this paper also highlight that while the approach adopted was not without challenges, in all three story maps a knowledge exchange process was fostered that resulted in young people feeling they had been listened to; were able to contribute to debates that affect their own lives and to instil a desire to create change, influence policy and inform publics about their lives. The paper concludes that story mapping is a useful creative process for extending young people's input into knowledge exchange and longer-term research impacts.

"Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Change Efforts for Young People in New Zealand: Demographics, Types of Suggesters, and Associations with Mental Health","Fenaughty, J.; Tan, K.; Ker, A.; Veale, J.; Saxton, P.; Alansari, M.","Sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts (SOGICE) are harmful practices, yet who suggests them to young people and what impacts are associated with these suggestions have received limited attention in the literature. The present study explored whether certain suggesters, and the frequency of categories of suggesters (including religious leaders, family members, and health professionals), were associated with suicidality and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The study also explored whether particular demographics of young people were more likely to report SOGICE experiences. Data were collected through an online survey of New Zealand gender- and sexuality-diverse youth. The sample (n = 3948) had an age range of 14–26 (mean age = 18.96), and approximately half (52.4%) were transgender or gender-diverse. Odds of suicidality and NSSI were highest when religious leaders suggested SOGICE and when more than one type of suggester was reported. SOGICE was more likely to be reported by transgender and gender-diverse youth, statutory care- and homelessness-experienced youth, and young people reporting current material deprivation.

"Illicit drug use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, trans and gender diverse, queer and asexual young people in Australia: Intersections and associated outcomes","Hill, A.O.; Amos, N.; Lyons, A.; Jones, J.; McGowan, I.; Carman, M.; Bourne, A.","Introduction: High rates of illicit drug use have been reported among gay and bisexual young men, however limited research has examined patterns of drug use among the broader population of lesbian, pansexual, trans and gender diverse, asexual and queer (LGBTQA) young people. We examined factors associated with illicit drug use in the past 6 months and lifetime experiences of self-reported concern with drug use among LGBTQA youth in Australia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 6418 LGBTQA participants aged 14–21 years, 5914 of whom provided information relating to their use of illicit drugs. Multivariable logistic regressions examined demographic factors and life experiences associated with drug use in the past 6 months and lifetime experiences of self-reported concern with drug use. Results: Overall, 26.4% of participants aged 14–17 and 41.9% aged 18–21 reported any drug use in the past 6 months, of whom 23.5% had ever been concerned about their drug use. Cannabis use was most commonly reported (28.3%), followed by ecstasy/MDMA (7.1%), antidepressants (5.6%) and LSD (3.5%). Higher odds of drug use were reported among cisgender men and those who had experienced homelessness or sexual harassment in the past 12 months. Higher odds of self-identified concern about drug use were observed among participants reporting challenging life experiences. Discussion and Conclusions: Rates of illicit drug use among LGBTQA young people in this study were considerably higher than those observed in general population youth studies in Australia and were further elevated among those who had experienced LGBTQA-related prejudice or harassment, or homelessness. © 2022 The Authors.

Using a System Dynamics Simulation Model to Identify Leverage Points for Reducing Youth Homelessness in Connecticut,"Hirsch, G.B.; Mosher, H.I.","Youth homelessness is a significant problem in most United States communities. Health problems are both a contributor to and a consequence of homelessness. Responses to youth homelessness are typically fragmentary. Different agencies deal with various causes and consequences of the problem. Stakeholders in Connecticut sought a more coherent approach. This article describes the development and use of a system dynamics simulation model as a decision-support tool that: (1) brings stakeholders together from diverse service sectors and allows them to see the system as a whole, (2) enables them to explore how delivery systems interact to affect homeless and unstably housed youth, (3) lets them test the impact of different intervention alternatives on reducing the problem, and (4) helps develop insights about coherent approaches to youth homelessness. The model’s development is described as a phased process including stakeholder engagement, causal mapping, and creation of the quantitative simulation model. The resulting model is presented along with an interface that enables stakeholders to use the model in a Learning Lab setting. Results of an initial set of Learning Labs are presented, including types of insights gained by participants from using the simulation model. Conclusions include limitations of the model and plans for its future use. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Systems,11,3,,,10.3390/systems11030163,,#564,Hirsch 2023,,
The deployment of discretionary power in the prevention and enactment of structural violence against young people experiencing homelessness,"Ratliff, G.A.; Harvey, T.L.; Jeffcoat, N.; Sarabia, R.; Yang, J.O.; Lightfoot, M.; Adams, S.; Lund, I.; Auerswald, C.L.","Background: Young people experiencing homelessness (YEH) interact with, and are reliant on, multiple social systems in their daily efforts to meet their basic needs. Criminalization of homelessness contributes to victimization, and social service providers can act as gatekeepers for access to services, yet little is known about how criminalization and social service policies impact access to food, housing, and other basic needs resources. Objective: This study aimed to explore how YEH access safety and basic needs resources and how they interface with social systems and systems agents while attempting to meet their basic needs. Participants and setting: Forty-five YEH participated in youth-led interviews across San Francisco. Methods: We conducted a qualitative Youth Participatory Action Research study utilizing Participatory Photo Mapping to interview YEH on their experiences of violence, safety, and accessing basic needs. A grounded theory analysis identified patterns of youth victimization and barriers to meeting their basic needs. Results: Analysis revealed the role of decision-making power of authority figures (e.g., social service providers, law enforcement officers, other gatekeepers) in enacting or preventing structural violence against YEH. When authority figures utilized their discretionary power to allow access to services, YEH were able to meet their basic needs. Discretionary power enacted to limit movement, prevent access, or cause physical harm limited the ability of YEH to meet their basic needs. Conclusions: The discretionary power of authority figures can contribute to structural violence when their discretion is used to interpret laws and policies in ways that prevent access to limited basic needs resources for YEH. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child Abuse Negl.,141,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106237,,#566,Ratliff 2023,,
Cognitive Strategies for Peer Judgments,"Olsson, H.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Galesic, M.; Hsu, H.-T.; Rice, E.","How do people make judgments about characteristics of their peers? We investigate what cognitive strategies underlie peer judgments, what group-level patterns of judgments these strategies produce, and whether they generate accurate judgments. We develop a general model that allows for comparison of different cognitive strategies including ego projection, probability matching, and three memory-based strategies. We examine it using a unique data set including self-reports and estimates of peer substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (N = 239). We find evidence for the adaptive use of strategies that are most appropriate given the information available from one’s personal experience and social environment. On the group level, the pattern of judgments sometimes resembles false consensus and sometimes false uniqueness, but overall shows a high level of accuracy. © 2023 American Psychological Association",2023,,Decision,10,3,268-287,,10.1037/dec0000208,,#571,Olsson 2023,,
A longitudinal investigation of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness,"Abramovich, A.; Pang, N.; Kim, K.V.; Stark, R.K.; Lange, S.; Chaiton, M.; Logie, C.H.; Hamilton, H.A.; Kidd, S.A.","Introduction The objective of this study was to examine the impacts of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on various dimensions of wellbeing among 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness over a 12-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods 2SLGBTQ+ youth (recruited using a convenience sampling method) participated in three online surveys to assess mental health (depression, anxiety, suicidality), substance and alcohol use, health care access, and violence for 12-months between 2021–2022. Quantitative data analysis included non-parametric one-sample proportion tests, paired t-test and McNemar’s test. Longitudinal data collected across all three timepoints were treated as paired data and compared to baseline data using non-parametric exact multinomial tests, and if significant, followed by pairwise post-hoc exact binomial tests. For the purposes of analysis, participants were grouped according to their baseline survey based on pandemic waves and public health restrictions. Results 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness (n = 87) reported high rates of mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression, over 12-months during the pandemic. Youth participants reported experiencing poor mental health during the early waves of the pandemic, with improvements to their mental health throughout the pandemic; however, results were not statistically significant. Likewise, participants experienced reduced access to mental health care during the early waves of the pandemic but mental health care access increased for youth throughout the pandemic. Conclusion Study results showed high rates of mental health issues among 2SLGBTQ+ youth, but reduced access to mental health care, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the need for 2SLGBTQ+ inclusive and affirming mental health care and services to address social and mental health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

"By Youth for Youth: Empowering Youth Experiencing Homelessness in Managua, Nicaragua","Hamel, K.; Lichtenstein, S.; Daley, M.; Castillo, M.; Kidd, S.","There is a dearth of effective, evidence-based programming to support youth experiencing homelessness, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where the majority of these young people live. Programs focused on youth engagement and leadership appear to be promising means to effectively engage and promote positive outcomes in this population. By Youth for Youth (BYFY) is a peer-led youth leadership framework developed to promote youth engagement, empowerment, and skill development. To date, BYFY has been successfully implemented with promising process and outcome indicators for youth experiencing homelessness, both in Toronto and with Indigenous youth in Thunder Bay. In this article, we present the application of BYFY with 30 street-involved youth in Managua, Nicaragua. We highlight the key implementation factors leading to BYFY’s success in Nicaragua as perceived by facilitators from the implementing organization, Covenant House International, and youth leaders. Using a General Inductive analysis of interview data, field notes, and artistic output generated by the project (rap video, graffiti art, street theater), we identify the processes that appeared to underlie positive outcomes observed in participants, including creating a sense of safety and providing opportunities to challenge negative self-perceptions. This article provides evidence for a scaleable model for youth engagement and empowerment that (a) is practical to implement in low-resource settings and (b) is effective at engaging street-involved youth across diverse cultures and contexts. We summarize practical implications and actionable measures that can be taken by stakeholders to capitalize on these findings. © 2023 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice",2023,,Am.

Building a Case for Targeted Surveillance and Assessment of LGBTQ+ Youth Needs and Experiences,"Mitsdarffer, M.L.; McColl, R.; Nescott, E.; Bianchetta, J.; Layland, E.K.; Tóth, T.","Objective: In this article, we examine the issue of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness in Delaware, summarize current services available and prior research work that has been done, examining the number, needs, and experiences of unaccompanied unhoused LGBTQ+ youth. Methods: We provide a literature review detailing risks associated with LGBTQ+ youth homelessness, resources available, and prior studies and surveys examining this population. Results: LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to physical and mental health challenges, abuse, and violence. The unique needs of this population necessitate specialized resources, yet there are a limited number of such resources available in Delaware and a dearth of information on youth homelessness in general, including LGBTQ+ youth. For example, administrative barriers exist for unaccompanied queer youth seeking shelter services, such as need for legal identification or being grouped in shelter populations based on sex assigned at birth rather than gender identity. Exposure to unsafe environments is a general problem for queer youth. This can make public spaces feel unsafe and increase risk of physical or mental harm, mistreatment, or abuse when seeking shelter outside of agency services and resources. In order to accurately identify and appropriately serve this population, additional research is necessary. Conclusions: Evidence building is a critical first step in creating an effective study to examine the issue of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness in Delaware. With the evidence acquired in our literature review our next step to establish an informed methodology is to hold service provider and LGBTQ+ lived experience focus groups. Through a qualitative approach we aim to learn how to appropriately utilize the quantitative tools identified in our analysis and to assess what questions are missing to advance the needs of this population. © 2023 Delaware Academy of Medicine.",2023,,Delaware J.

"“If they had a place to live, they would be taking medication”: a qualitative study identifying strategies for engaging street-connected young people in the HIV prevention-care continuum in Kenya","Embleton, L.; Shah, P.; Apondi, E.; Ayuku, D.; Braitstein, P.","Introduction: Street-connected young people (SCY) experience structural and social barriers to engaging in the HIV prevention-care continuum. We sought to elicit recommendations for interventions that may improve SCY's engagement along the HIV prevention-care continuum from healthcare providers, policymakers, community members and SCY in Kenya. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Nakuru and Kitale counties in Kenya between May 2017 and September 2018 to explore and describe the public perceptions of, and proposed and existing responses to, the phenomenon of SCY. This secondary analysis focuses on a subset of data interviews that investigated SCY's healthcare needs in relation to HIV prevention and care. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews and seven focus group discussions with 100 participants, of which 43 were SCY. In total, 48 participants were women and 52 men. Results: Our analysis resulted in four major themes corresponding to stages in the HIV prevention-care continuum for key populations. We identified the need for an array of strategies to engage SCY in HIV prevention and testing services that are patient-centred and responsive to the diversity of their circumstances. The use of pre-exposure prophylaxis was a biomedical prevention strategy that SCY and healthcare providers alike stressed the need to raise awareness around and access to for SCY. Several healthcare providers suggested peer-based approaches for engaging SCY throughout the continuum. However, SCY heavily debated the appropriateness of using peer-based methods. Structural interventions, such as the provision of food and housing, were suggested as strategies to improve antiretroviral therapy adherence. Conclusions: This study identified contextually relevant interventions that should be adapted and piloted for use with SCY. Education and sensitization of SCY and healthcare providers alike were identified as possible strategies, along with affordable housing and anti-poverty strategies as cash transfers and provision of food. Peer-based interventions are a clear option but require SCY-specific adaptation to be implemented effectively. © 2022 The Authors.

Objectives: The present study aimed to identify the prevalence, distribution, sociodemographic determinants, and risk-taking associated with alcohol and drug use among SICY. Methods: Studies published in English related to alcohol and drug use among SICY were searched for from December 1 1985 to July 1 2022, on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Results: After full-text paper evaluation, 73 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results indicated that lifetime prevalence rates were 44% (alcohol), 44% (crack), 33% (inhalants), 44% (solvents), 16% (tranquilizer/sedatives), 22% (opioids), and 62% (polysubstance use). The current prevalence rates were 40% (alcohol), 21% (crack), 20% (inhalants), 11% (tranquilizer/sedatives), and 1% (opioids). Also, life-time and current prevalence of alcohol and crack use, current prevalence of tranquilizer/sedative use, and life-time prevalence of polysubstance use were higher among older age groups. Life-time prevalence of tranquilizer/sedative use was lower among older age groups. Conclusions: The high prevalence of using alcohol, crack, and inhalants is a major issue because they are used extensively among different age groups, including minors. Such findings are beneficial for policymakers, health authorities, and professionals in developing programs aimed at minimizing inhalant use and other types of substance use harms among this group. It is important to accurately monitor this risk-exposed population to understand the mechanisms that might help protect them from high-risk substance use. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2023,,Am.

A Longitudinal Exploration of How Connections to Staff Facilitate Efficacy and Service Use in Drop-in Centers Serving Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Rice, E.R.; DiGuiseppi, G.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Casey, E.; Cooper, T.; DiBattiste, M.","Introduction: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) benefit from a variety of services to meet their immediate and long-term needs. Drop-in centers are a popular service venue used by YEH. However, the mechanisms responsible for engaging youth in drop-in services are not clear. The current study uses longitudinal data to explore the role of positive staff relationships in increasing youths’ knowledge and efficacy to access and subsequently use drop-in center services. Methods: 731 youth (Mage = 21.8, SD = 2.2, 25.1% female) accessing services at three drop-in centers in Los Angeles, California participated in the study. Surveys were completed at baseline, 1-month, and 3-months later. Path models examined the direct effect of positive relationships with adult staff on service use at the 3-month follow-up, and the indirect effect of service knowledge (assessed at the 1-month follow-up). Results: The direct effect model showed that positive staff relationships at baseline were significantly associated with number of services used at the 3-month follow-up (aIRR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.54). Positive staff relationships were also associated with greater service knowledge at 1-month (b = 0.93, p < 0.001), which in turn was associated with greater service use at 3-months (IRR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.28). The indirect effect of service knowledge was significant (b = 0.13, p = 0.02), suggesting that the association between positive staff relationships and service use was completely mediated by service knowledge. Conclusions: The current study adds to the literature by demonstrating that positive relationships with staff lead to increased service use by increasing youths’ knowledge and efficacy to access services. Efforts should be made to develop positive relationships with YEH in order to engage them in essential services needed to exit homelessness. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,J.

The Relationship Between Housing Status and Behavioral Health Outcomes Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness With a Foster Care History,"Wu, Q.; Lawler, S.M.; Hatch, E.; Villagrana, K.M.; Ferguson, K.M.","Objective: Stable housing is vital for improving behavioral health outcomes among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). However, few studies have focused on YEH with foster care history and the relationship between housing status and behavioral health. This study examined whether housing status (i.e., literally homeless vs. unstably housed) was significantly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive episode, and substance use disorder (SUD). Literal homelessness was defined as living on the street or in a temporary shelter; unstably housed re-ferred to living with parents, family, or foster parents but seeking services at a YEH drop-in center. Method: Data were from YEH ages 14–23 at YEH-serving agencies in three U.S. cities (N = 175): Los Angeles, CA; Denver, CO; and Austin, TX. We used propensity score weighting to balance the two comparison groups (i.e., literally homeless vs. unsta-bly housed). Results: YEH who were unstably housed were significantly less likely than those who were literally homeless to meet thecriteriaforPTSDbutweremorelikelyto meet SUD criteria. Conclusions: Increased attention should be paid to the behavioral health outcomes of YEH with a foster care history.

Method: A cluster analysis of outcome data from 148 youth was conducted. Results: Cluster 1 (n = 67) demonstrated significant decreases in risky behavior (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex, crime, and substance use) and poor interpersonal relationships (e.g. more interaction with family and friends and lower rates of violence) but experienced relatively fewer interactions with family and friends. Cluster 2 (n = 57) demonstrated a significant decrease in poor life functioning (e.g., lower rates of employment/education, better quality of life, and less symptoms of internalizing disorders). Cluster 3 (n = 24) experienced significant increases in risky behavior, poor life functioning, and poor interpersonal relationships. Discussion: Clusters 1 and 2 improved over six months of care. Cluster 3 deteriorated despite receiving similar services and used more opioids and stimulants. Conclusions: Peer engagement in programs for this population are important.

Method: A single-group pretest-posttest design was used to determine the impact of MAP. Participants completed the co-researcher music therapist-developed Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for five independent variables (i.e. self-reported levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue, physical tension, and mood), before and after participating in individual MAP sessions. Multivariate ANOVAs for repeated measures were used considering time (pretest-posttest), and MAP sessions as within-subjects factors. Results: Nine youth (n = 9) participated in one to three MAP sessions. There were 20 pre-tests and post-tests for each independent variable except for anxiety, for which 19 pre-tests and post-tests were completed. Results of quantitative data analysis show a statistically significant decrease in scores for self-reported levels of stress, anxiety and physical tension at post-session as compared to pre-session. No significant effect was observed for fatigue. Finally, mood scores significantly improved from prettest to posttest.

"“They are always focusing on the person who is doing the worst”: Exploring how crisis shapes young people's pathways in and out of supportive housing in Vancouver, Canada","Manson, D.; Fast, D.","Housing instability, homelessness, and mental health among young people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada, and elsewhere have increasingly been framed through a language of crisis. The declaration of overlapping housing, mental health, and addictions crises in our own setting has prompted a wide range of interventions, including the rapid expansion of supportive housing programs that include integrated housing-based substance use and mental health care. There is growing evidence demonstrating that these models are effective at stabilizing people who are experiencing protracted housing instability, mental health, and substance use related health concerns. We recount stories of three young people who have lived in supportive housing to argue that achieving the relative stability afforded by these interventions is partially contingent on maintaining a delicate balance between being in a state of “too much” or “too little” in crisis. These stories demonstrate two key findings. First, being in crisis has made these young people visible to housing, substance use, and mental health programs that may not otherwise be available to them. Secondly, entering periods of protracted or intense mental health crisis may reopen pathways into unstable housing and homelessness by activating undesirable institutional responses that conflict with young people's desire for self-determination in relation to their care. This study underscores that supportive housing should be part of a broader youth focused system of housing and care that seeks to address the needs of young people before they enter states of crisis. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,Soc.

Brain Changes Linked to Cognitive Symptomatology in Homeless Youth,"Bounds, D.; Woo, M.A.; Nyamathi, A.; Kehoe, P.; Roy, B.; Yadav, K.; Cabrera-Mino, C.; Kumar, R.","Youth impacted by homelessness experience diminished cognition due to a variety of reasons including mental health symptoms, alcohol and substance use, and adverse childhood experiences. However, the status of specific brain regions which could impact important cognitive functions in homeless youth remains unclear. In this pilot comparative and correlational study, a series of demographic, psychological, cognitive assessments, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 10 male youth experiencing homelessness and 9 age-matched healthy male controls (age range: 18–25 years). Participants experiencing homelessness had significantly decreased regional brain gray matter tissue in comparison to the controls. Moreover, there were strong inverse correlations between the brain regions classically associated with executive decision-making (prefrontal cortices), depression (insular lobes), and conflict resolution (anterior cingulate), and the level of the symptoms detected by their questionnaires. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Clin.

In defense of vulnerability,"Robinson, C.","Is vulnerability a poisoned conceptual chalice from which only individualized notions of suffering and responsibility can emerge? What would the concept of vulnerability have to do in order to be considered valuable in advancing social justice? In this article I utilize critique of the ‘vulnerability turn’ in child and youth policy as a launch pad into rethinking an emboldened account of vulnerability. In particular, I am drawn to the urgency of vulnerability, understood as an immediate openness to wounding, and find ethical and practical value in the unfinished business of struggling to justly define what constitutes vulnerability and who counts as vulnerable. Grounding theoretical exploration in reflections on unique Australian research on unaccompanied homeless children, the article seeks to advance vulnerability as a potentially radical tool for research and welfare policy that can grip the lived complexity of systemic and personal adversity. © 2023, Crown.",2023,,Subjectivity,30,1,22-Mar,,10.1057/s41286-022-00146-3,,#607,Robinson 2023,,
Nowhere to go: Housing pathways of college students with foster care and homelessness experience,"Skobba, K.; Moorman, D.; Meyers, D.; White, K.; Tiller, L.","This study builds on previous research to understand longer term housing experiences in late adolescence and early adulthood for vulnerable college students. Using a biographical, qualitative method, we study high school and college housing and family circumstances for 27 students with homelessness or foster care experience enrolled in 4-year colleges in Georgia. We identified three different housing pathway types in high school—family homelessness, unaccompanied youth and foster care. Housing instability and frequent moves were common in high school among all housing pathway types. In college, students who were able to find low or no-cost housing and those who identified a foster care pathway in high school achieved greater housing stability. Others students experienced a continuation of housing instability that began in high school. Additional funding to cover the cost of on-campus housing would likely contribute to increased stability. Additional strategies, such as rental assistance programmes tailored for college students, may be needed to address housing instability for vulnerable college students. More research on the unmet housing needs and the consequences of housing instability during college for homeless and foster youth is needed to further a housing policy agenda that focuses on practical solutions. © 2022 The Authors.

"Youth experiencing, and youth at risk of, homelessness: Associations between trauma type, posttraumatic negative cognitions, and posttraumatic stress disorder.","Bird, C.; Jenzer, T.; Read, J.","Background: Experiencing homelessness as an adolescent or young adult confers risk for trauma experiences and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite being a unique and at-risk group, research on the mechanisms that can impact PTSD symptom severity in this population is scant. One variable that has been found to follow both interpersonal trauma (IPT; e.g., acts of violence or neglect by a perpetrator) and noninterpersonal trauma (non-IPT; e.g., natural disasters, motor vehicle accidents) is posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), or negative thoughts about the self, the world, and self-blame, following a traumatic experience. Method: This study aimed to describe the experiences of IPT and non-IPT in this sample. Second, we aimed to be the first to identify how IPT and non-IPT impact PTCs for youth experiencing and youth at risk for homelessness. Finally, we examined the impact of PTCs on PTSD following both IPT and non-IPT. Data derived from a sample of youth at risk for homelessness and youth experiencing homelessness (N = 63) in Buffalo, New York, United States were analyzed. Results: PTCs have been found to follow trauma exposure which was corroborated by mediation analyses in our study. Mediation models identified that PTCs about the self (β = .34, SE = 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.14, .6]), and self-blame (β = .14, SE = 0.07, [.01, .3]), partially mediated the relationship between IPT and PTSD. Significant mediation pathways of PTCs were not found between non-IPT and PTSD.

In addition, youths of color and sexual minority youths are disproportionately more likely to experience homelessness. For the first time, in 2021, the nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Survey included an item assessing housing stability, or nighttime residence among students in grades 9-12 in the United States. During 2021, 2.7% of U.S. high school students experienced unstable housing. Among racial and ethnic subgroups, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander youths were most likely to experience unstable housing, followed by American Indian or Alaska Native and Black youths. Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning or other) youths were more likely to experience unstable housing compared with their heterosexual peers. Compared with students who were stably housed, students who were unstably housed were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors, substance use, and suicide ideation and attempts, and to experience violence. These findings highlight which adverse health risks and behaviors are elevated among youths experiencing housing insecurity.

Interpersonal or Institutional: Understanding Service User Oppression in Social Service Organizations Through Staff Interactions,"Ramsundarsingh, S.; Shier, M.L.","Service user experiences of oppression by human service organizations (HSOs) has long been understood through the lens of service providers, with service users largely excluded from research in this area. This qualitative study, the second phase of a mixed methods study, presents the findings of 9 focus groups (n=66) with service users from 13 different HSOs representing seven service areas (eg. Homelessness, addictions, youth) on the topic of service user experiences of oppression by HSOs. Using a semi-structured interview guide, participants were asked to share both positive and negative experiences with HSOs and recommendations to address oppression. The discussion identified important elements of the relationship between service providers and service users such as consistency, responsiveness, motivation, and competency that impact service user oppression. The findings from this qualitative phase help to develop a conceptual model of how oppression is rooted in organizations through service provider and service user interpersonal relationships. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.",2023,,J.

"Impact of community strategy package on uptake of reproductive tract infections health services among young street females in the municipality of Eldoret, Kenya","Maritim, C.V.; Wanyoro, A.; Maingi, J.; Nyamari, J.; Ng'ang'a, M.","Background: Despite the intervention of free medical care services for street children by a dedicated clinic in Eldoret municipality, health care service of young street females (YSFs) is still deficient. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of the community strategy package on the uptake of reproductive tract infections (RTI) health services among the target population. Materials and methods: A pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental with a qualitative and quantitative approach was applied among the YSFs aged 10–24 years. The study used structured questionnaires and key informant interviews to collect data from the respondents. Results: The study enrolled a total of 77 young street females in Eldoret municipality. A significantly higher proportion of respondents reportedly first sought treatment for RTI at a health facility after the implementation of the community strategy package (97.1%) when compared to the proportion of respondents who first sought treatment at a health facility in the pre-intervention phase (51.0%)(p＜0.001). Early seeking of treatment improved significantly after the introduction of the intervention; 72.0% and 94.1% of the respondents sought treatment early during the pre-intervention and post-intervention phase, respectively (p ​= ​0.011). Conclusion: The study recommends the adoption of the community strategy as an intervention to increase the uptake of RTIs health services and promotion of the reproductive health of young street females. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,Gynecol.

Gender Minority Youth Experiencing Homelessness and Corresponding Health Disparities,"Deal, C.; Doshi, R.D.; Gonzales, G.","Purpose: Pediatricians and youth service providers frequently interface with vulnerable populations, including gender minority youth (e.g., transgender, nonbinary, gender questioning, and other gender diverse individuals) and youth experiencing homelessness. The purposes of this study are to estimate the prevalence of homelessness and types of homelessness experienced among gender minority youth and their corresponding health outcomes. Methods: Data for this study came from gender minority (n = 3,194) and cisgender (n = 93,337) high school students who answered questions on transgender status and homelessness status in the 2017 and 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). We compared the prevalence of homelessness between gender minority and cisgender youth and assessed where youth experiencing homelessness had slept in the prior month: shelters, nonparental homes, streets, hotel, or other locations. Finally, logistic regression models and marginal effects (ME) were used to examine health outcomes at the intersection of gender minority status and homelessness. Results: 22% of gender minority youth reported homelessness during the prior month. Cisgender youth were significantly less likely to report being homeless (3%). Transgender youth experiencing homelessness were significantly more likely to live on the streets than cisgender youth experiencing homelessness (ME = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.10–0.30; p < .001). Gender minority youth experiencing homelessness reported elevated health-risk behaviors in excess of nonhomeless gender minority youth and cisgender youth experiencing homelessness.

"Race, homelessness and inner-city policy in 1980s Britain","Child, P.","This article utilizes an organizational history of the Birmingham-based Handsworth Single Homeless Action Group (HSHAG) to explore black youth homelessness and inner-city policy in 1980s Britain. It draws upon under-used charity archives to intervene in recent debates, considering the part played by the voluntary sector within the Thatcher administrations' inner-city policies and what targeted funding of this kind reveals about the remaking of the welfare state in these years. First, it introduces HSHAG, setting out the context of inner-city funding programmes, before questioning how sustainable this might have been for voluntary organizations engaged in supporting the homeless population. Secondly, it examines the effects of housing privatization and unemployment on HSHAG's attempts to advise homeless black individuals and assert their rights as citizens to state support. Together, it exposes the role of the voluntary sector in welfare state restructuring and considers how this change made the task of homelessness organizations Herculean.

"Prevalence and Social-Structural Correlates of Gender-Based Violence Against Women Living With HIV in Metro Vancouver, Canada","Ohtsuka, M.S.; Shannon, K.; Zucchet, A.; Krüsi, A.; Bingham, B.; King, D.; Axl-Rose, T.; Braschel, M.; Deering, K.N.","Violence experienced by cisgender (cis) and gender minority women living with HIV is known to be high. More work is needed to better understand how to support women living with HIV who have experienced violence. The objectives of this study are therefore to identify the prevalence and correlates of violence by any perpetrator among women living with HIV in a Canadian setting. Data were drawn from 9 years (January, 2010 to February, 2019) of a longitudinal community-based open cohort study of 350+ cis and trans women living with HIV who were living and/or accessed care in Metro Vancouver, Canada (Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS: Women’s Longitudinal Needs Assessment “SHAWNA”). Participants completed baseline and biannual follow-up interviews. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) were performed to identify correlates of recent (last 6 months) violence (physical and/or sexual) by any perpetrator. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) are presented. At baseline, prevalence of violence was high: 95.5% (recent = 19.4%) of participants reported lifetime physical and/or sexual violence, 94.8% (recent = 17.9%) reported lifetime physical violence, and 84.5% (recent = 5.7%) reported lifetime sexual violence. In multivariable logistic regression with GEE, the following variables were associated with higher odds of recent physical/sexual violence: youth (<30 years) (AOR: 1.60, 95% CI [1.15, 2.22]), recent unstable housing/homelessness (AOR: 1.96, 95% CI [1.30, 2.97]), recent food insecurity (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI [1.13, 2.17]), recent incarceration (AOR: 1.85, 95% CI [1.18, 2.91]), recent opioid use (AOR: 1.38, 95% CI [1.04, 1.82]), recent stimulant use (AOR: 2.48, 95% CI [1.72, 3.56]), and lifetime HIV status disclosure without consent (AOR: 1.59, 95% CI [1.13, 2.24]). Trauma- and violence-informed (TVI) policies that include a focus on confidentiality and safe disclosure practices should be integrated into existing housing, incarceration, and harm reduction programs, and HIV care and practice for women living with HIV.

"Physical, mental and healthcare issues of children on the street of Ibadan, Nigeria","Obimakinde, A.M.; Shabir, M.","Background: Most street children studied in lower and middle-income African countries are without family links. However, the majority of street children are children on the street, living with families during the night and spending their day-time on the streets. The health of this majority group is poorly captured in the literature despite the growing epidemic of child streetism. Aim: To explore the health of children on the street of Ibadan using multiple qualitative studies. Setting: A street in each of the five urban local government areas of Ibadan Oyo State, Nigeria. Methods: Participants comprising of children on the street, parental figures, street shop owners and child-welfare officers were purposively selected and interviewed. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Results: Using triangulated data from 53 interviews, the study found that the children on the streets of Ibadan experienced many health challenges. Outstanding are poor carbohydratebased diet, open defaecation with consequent infections, physical injuries and few deaths from road traffic accidents. Sexual, verbal and substance abuse were common although few children acquired resilience to adversity. The children had poor health-seeking behaviour and resorted to patent medicine dealers or tradomedical practitioners on the streets. Conclusion: This study bridged some gaps in the literature regarding the health of children on the streets in Nigeria. The straddling of children between the family and street has cumulative health consequences as depicted in this study. Contribution: This research can inform family-level intervention and primary health care plans to forestall the health challenges of children on the streets. © © 2023. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

Objective: Our two primary objectives were 1) to compare recent child abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual) between OSCA living in institutional environments and those in family-based care; and 2) to understand how recent child abuse among street-connected children and youth compared to these other vulnerable youth populations. Participants and setting: This project followed a cohort of OSCA in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya (2009–2019). This analysis includes 2393 participants aged 18 years and below, 1017 from institutional environments, 1227 from family-based care, and 95 street-connected participants. Methods: The primary outcome of interest was recent abuse. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of recent abuse at baseline, follow-up, and chronically for each abuse domain and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) between care environments, controlling for multiple factors. Results: In total, 47 % of OSCA reported ever experiencing any kind of recent abuse at baseline and 54 % in follow-up. Compared to those in family-based care, street-connected participants had a much higher reported prevalence of all types of recent abuse at baseline (AOR: 5.01, 95 % CI: 2.89, 9.35), in follow-up (AOR: 5.22, 95 % CI: 2.41, 13.98), and over time (AOR: 3.44, 95 % CI: 1.93, 6.45). OSCA in institutional care were no more likely than those in family-based care of reporting any recent abuse at baseline (AOR: 0.85 95 % CI: 0.59–1.17) or incident abuse at follow-up (AOR: 0.91, 95 % CI: 0.61–1.47). Conclusion: OSCA, irrespective of care environment, reported high levels of recent physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Street-connected participants had the highest prevalence of all kinds of abuse. OSCA living in institutional care did not experience more child abuse than those living in family-based care. © 2021 The Authors",2023,,Child Abuse Negl.,139,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104920,,#628,Ayaya 2023,,
The Use of Technology to Provide Mental Health Services to Youth Experiencing Homelessness: Scoping Review,"Lal, S.; Elias, S.; Sieu, V.; Peredo, R.","Background: There is growing interest in using information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve access to mental health services for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH); however, limited efforts have been made to synthesize this literature. Objective: This study aimed to review the research on the use of ICTs to provide mental health services and interventions for YEH. Methods: We used a scoping review methodology following the Arksey and O’Malley framework and guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The results are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A systematic search was conducted from 2005 to 2021 in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Maestro and in ProQuest Thesis and Dissertations, Papyrus, Homeless Hub, and Google Scholar for gray literature. Studies were included if participants’ mean age was between 13 and 29 years, youth with mental health issues were experiencing homelessness or living in a shelter, ICTs were used as a means of intervention, and the study provided a description of the technology. The exclusion criteria were technology that did not allow for interaction (eg, television) and languages other than French or English. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative approaches. Two reviewers were involved in the screening and data extraction process in consultation with a third reviewer. The data were summarized in tables and by narrative synthesis. Results: From the 2153 abstracts and titles screened, 12 were included in the analysis. The most common types of ICTs used were communication technologies (eg, phone, video, and SMS text messages) and mobile apps. The intervention goals varied widely across studies; the most common goal was reducing risky behaviors, followed by addressing cognitive functioning, providing emotional support, providing vital resources, and reducing anxiety. Most studies (9/11, 82%) focused on the feasibility of interventions. Almost all studies reported high levels of acceptability (8/9, 89%) and moderate to high frequency of use (5/6, 83%). The principal challenges were related to technical problems such as the need to replace phones, issues with data services, and phone charging. Conclusions: Our results indicate the emerging role of ICTs in the delivery of mental health services to YEH and that there is a high level of acceptability based on early feasibility studies. However, our results should be interpreted cautiously, considering the limited number of studies included in the analysis and the elevated levels of dropout. There is a need to advance efficacy and effectiveness research in this area with larger and longer studies. ©Shalini Lal, Sarah Elias, Vida Sieu, Rossana Peredo.",2023,,J. Med.

Staff Members’ Experience of Italian Shelters for LGBTQIA+ Homeless and Runaway People: An Exploratory Study,"Tubertini, E.; Carbone, A.; Santinello, M.","Background: Some LGBTQIA+ people, after coming out, experience marginalization and homelessness due to rejection and discrimination from their family and community. The increase in support requests led to the creation of LGBTQIA+ temporary shelter homes worldwide. This study aims to explore the functioning and effectiveness of shelters, analyzing the experiences of staff members in Italy. Methods: Focus groups were held with a total of 15 staff members (age range: 32–53) working in three shelters for LGBTQIA+ people. Data were analyzed qualitatively through the grounded theory methodology. Results: Data coding showed five final core categories: (1) user characteristics; (2) staff characteristics; (3) community relations; (4) activities carried out by services; (5) criteria for intervention assessment and staff satisfaction. Results revealed some criticalities in the effectiveness of these services, particularly the difficulty in achieving autonomy for users, a weakness attributable to the non-exhaustive training of staff members and the funding discontinuity. Conclusion: To improve the efficacy of shelters, this study emphasizes the necessity to (a) carry out an analysis of the vulnerability of the local LGBTQIA+ community, (b) establish a stable network with local services (NHS system), and (c) implement staff members’ psychological training. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Int.

"The family dynamics of children on the streets of Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria","Obimakinde, A.M.; Shabir, M.","Background: Children roaming the streets estimated at 1 in 10 by a 2021 United Nation Children’s Funds (UNICEF) report is a growing problem, in cities of lower-and middle-income African countries. Studies of street children with no family ties abound, but there is a paucity of studies on children on the street who exist within families and return home daily. We explored the family dynamics of children on the streets of Ibadan, emphasising family structure, resources and relationships. Methods: Using an exploratory design based on a qualitative approach 53 participants were interviewed, including children on the streets, parental figures, child-welfare officers and street shop owners. Participants were selected from streets in the five urban local government areas of Ibadan, Nigeria. Recorded data were transcribed, and framework analysis was performed. Results: The family dynamics included family structural problems, poor family resources and poor parent-child relationships. The family structural problems included: broken homes, large families and ambivalence around polygamy as subthemes. Family resources comprised: poor economic resources, poor social resources, educational challenges, cultural ambivalence and spiritual backdrops. The family relationships patterns included: poor adaptability, economic-oriented partnership, poor growth support, poor emotional connection and poor family bonding. Conclusion: The dynamics driving a family’s choice for child streetism in Ibadan, mostly to hawk, are devaluation of family life, parenting irresponsibility, and poor filial relationship, underscored by economic constraints and socio-cultural decadence. The results of this research buttress the need for family-level interventions to forestall the escalating phenomenon of child streetism in Ibadan, Nigeria.

Solving Homelessness in Delaware Requires Resolving the Disparities That Cause It,"Rent, S.","There are several paths to homelessness for adults and families, including a lack of affordable housing, financial crises such as unemployment, underemployment and low wages, and domestic violence. For youth, homelessness can be the result of running away from family conflict, family poverty, domestic violence, being put out of their homes, or loss of resources after aging out of state programs like foster care. The aim of this essay is to discuss the common paths to homelessness for adults, youth, and survivors of domestic violence as well as the associated health outcomes related to homelessness in relation to health equity and the social determinants of health. Additionally, this piece identifies existing disparities in homelessness, highlights Delaware resources, and seeks ways that Delaware can end involuntary homelessness in Delaware. Homelessness disproportionately affects minority populations more than other groups and has direct adverse health consequences on these populations. The poor health outcomes linked to homelessness can be many, co-occurring, and lifelong. If social determinants continue to be lacking, homelessness can become chronic. Homelessness is a prevalent public health issue in Delaware. With a health equity lens, state and community resources and solutions can be applied to help reduce homelessness and its disparities. © 2023 Delaware Academy of Medicine.",2023,,Delaware J.

"‘We're not a separate entity, we're staff now’ The involvement of transition age youth peer supporters in trauma-informed community partnerships","Siantz, E.; Center, K.; Lansing, A.E.; Sanghvi, N.; Gilmer, T.P.","Background: Transition age youth (TAY) experiencing mental illness, homelessness, and trauma face challenges in navigating the transition to adulthood. Age appropriate, trauma-informed support from peer specialists (PS) can assist TAY who have experienced trauma in navigating their transition to adulthood. Whether and how TAY PS are involved in trauma-informed community-based partnerships is unclear. This study explores TAY PS experiences with and social network positions in trauma-informed ‘TAY-support networks.’ Methods: Social network data were collected from four TAY-support networks. Structural analyses (network size and density) and core periphery analyses were conducted to elucidate TAY PS network positions, while focus groups were conducted with TAY PS to understand their experiences delivering services. Focus group data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Data were triangulated to understand whether and how focus group results expanded on our social network analysis. Results: TAY support networks included 194 persons (range: 32–55) and 26 TAY PS. In two networks, TAY PS were located at the network's core and periphery, and reported ongoing contributions to initiative activities. In two other networks, TAY PS were located at the network periphery and reported challenges with team communication.

Hierarchical regression indicated that secure attachment with the keyworker was independently predicted by failed protection and goal-corrected partnership. Preoccupied attachment with the keyworker was predicted by fear of parental loss and client post-traumatic stress while avoidant attachment to the keyworker was predicted by goal-corrected partnership. These findings suggested that the relationship between youth experiencing homelessness and hostel staff was linked with the formers’ attachment experiences with their caregivers. In Study 2, 46 homeless individuals undergoing psychological therapy completed measures of attachment and psychopathology before and after treatment. Moderated hierarchical regression suggested that individuals experiencing homelessness who tended to be avoidantly attached to their keyworkers had relatively limited improvement in post-traumatic stress after therapy. Present studies identified specific ways in which the attachment system is implicated in the homeless-keyworker relationship. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,,Child. Youth Serv.

Improving school attendance among homeless children: Evaluating the attendance matters program,"Treglia, D.; Cassidy, M.; Bainbridge, J.","Absenteeism is a prevailing concern in American education, and students experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to high rates of school absenteeism. Despite this increased risk, we find no research in which the primary focus is assessing the efficacy of shelter-based programs that seek to reduce absenteeism among homeless children. Thus, we evaluate the Attendance Matters program, which sought to improve school attendance among homeless students in New York City shelters through interagency coordination, leveraging data to target scarce program resources, and employing evidence-based social work practices. We use administrative data in a quasi-experimental study to evaluate the program's effects on school attendance and, secondarily, on outcomes of proficiency and stability. Findings suggest that the program resulted in reductions in days absent and the absence rate among K-8 students, though findings for secondary outcomes and attendance outcomes for high school students were inconsistent across model specifications. Results, which likely understate actual program effects, have implications beyond this setting, as they suggest that a low-budget program leveraging evidence-based practices and existing resources can impact this seemingly intractable problem. Education and homelessness policymakers should seek opportunities to test replication in additional settings. © 2023",2023,,Child. Youth Serv.

A Scientific Approach to Addressing Social Issues Using Administrative Data,"Green, D.; Simard-Duplain, G.; Sweetman, A.; Warburton, W.","We use linked administrative data on education, health, social services, and crime from British Columbia, Canada, to document the relationship between measures of secondary educational attainment and indicators of poor outcomes later in life. Poor outcomes are seen primarily among high school dropouts. Next, we document the ability of characteristics observed in grade four to predict high school graduation using a simple model that produces a lower bound. It straightforwardly identifies more than one-fifth of future dropouts with reasonable accuracy. Non-cognitive measures (especially social and emotional characteristics) are better predictors of educational attainment than cognitive ones.

"Circus Activities as a Health Intervention for Children, Youth, and Adolescents: A Scoping Review","Coulston, F.; Cameron, K.L.; Sellick, K.; Cavallaro, M.; Spittle, A.; Toovey, R.","Circus activities are emerging as an engaging and unique health intervention. This scoping review summarises the evidence on this topic for children and young people aged up to 24 years to map (a) participant characteristics, (b) intervention characteristics, (c) health and wellbeing outcomes, and (d) to identify evidence gaps. Using scoping review methodology, a systematic search of five databases and Google Scholar was conducted up to August 2022 for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fifty-seven of 897 sources of evidence were included (42 unique interventions). Most interventions were undertaken with school-aged participants; however, four studies included participants with age ranges over 15 years. Interventions targeted both general populations and those with defined biopsychosocial challenges (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental illness, or homelessness). Most interventions utilised three or more circus disciplines and were undertaken in naturalistic leisure settings. Dosage could be calculated for 15 of the 42 interventions (range one-96 h). Improvements in physical and/or social-emotional outcomes were reported for all studies. There is emerging evidence of positive health outcomes resulting from circus activities used in general populations and those with defined biopsychosocial challenges. Future research should focus on detailed reporting of intervention elements and increasing the evidence base in preschool-aged children and within populations with the greatest need. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,J.

Is queer-and-trans youth homelessness a form of displacement? A queer epistemological review of refugee studies’ theoretical borders,"Ritholtz, S.","The phenomenon of queer-and-trans internal migration from homophobic to “safe” areas in the United States remains under-studied in the literature of refugee and forced migration studies. Rejected from their communities and facing discrimination, queer-and-trans youth leave home and may not find another–can their experience of homelessness be considered forced migration? In this paper, I employ critical and normative theory to explore the logics that produce cisheteronormative assumptions in refugee studies. I posit that there is an epistemological cisheteronormativity informing the theory of knowledge of the discipline and causing the internal migration of queer-and-trans people in the United States to be overlooked. I use the case study of queer-and-trans youth experiencing homelessness to reveal how epistemological cisheteronormativity prevents us from asking crucial questions about queer-and-trans migrants that would not only render their displacement legible, but also challenge the prevailing, depoliticizing assumptions associated with the liberal queer-and-trans subject. © 2022 The Author(s).

The key factors contributing to the persistence of homelessness,"Zhao, E.","Homelessness is a long-standing social problem in many countries. People who work and volunteer in homeless shelters struggle with the question of how to help homeless people lead an independent life. We sought to answer this question using insights obtained from Google Scholar literature searches and personal experiences with homeless people. In this brief research, we explored the main causes of homelessness in the United States for children, youth, adults, elderly, women, and veterans, over the past decade. The results showed that the three leading causes of homelessness were substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental illness. These problems lead to the initial homelessness, and in turn, homelessness further exacerbates these problems. Preventing and reducing homelessness requires effective policies and community interventions, such as rehabilitation facilities for people with substance abuse, job placement assistance and accommodation for homeless people, and homeless camps in designated areas to serve as bases to help homeless people rebuild their lives.

Young and hungry in the United Kingdom: a qualitative study of youth food insecurity in Edinburgh and London,"McPherson, C.","Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, food insecurity was rising steadily and attracting growing concern across the UK. Young people are disproportionately more exposed to food insecurity because of their higher risks of poverty, destitution and homelessness, and because of discriminations in the labour market and social security system. Despite this, very little is known about youth food insecurity in the UK, where the assumption that young people can rely on parental support prevails. This article draws on qualitative interviews with 13 young people, aged 18–26, conducted during the height of nationwide lockdowns in Edinburgh and London in 2020. By engaging with young people from a range of circumstances, this article provides important insights into experiences of youth food insecurity. It finds that while youth food insecurity stems from the familiar trigger of low income, young people are not only more exposed to this risk, but also encounter additional risks linked to being young, including leaving home for the first time. Similarly, this article illustrates that while people of all ages generally prefer to manage their food insecurity independently due to the stigma attached to food insecurity, notions of independence seem particularly important to the young people and their narratives of emerging adulthood in this study, with implications for their (dis)engagement with support. The findings challenge ingrained policy assumptions about young people, and suggest a need for significant policy activity around youth food insecurity, which has been troublingly overlooked in the UK. © Policy Press 2023.",2023,,J.

"“Like rubbing salt into the wound”: Lived experiences of homeless youth in Gondar City, Ethiopia","Bihonegn, A.A.","Despite growing research on homeless street children, women and elderly people in Ethiopia, there is little empirical evidence regarding the experiences of homeless street youth in the country. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological research is therefore to understand the lived experiences of street homeless youth aged between 18 and 29 years in Gondar city. Face -to-face in-depth interview was conducted with 9 purposively selected study participants. Interviews were transcribed, coded, categorized and thematized through thematic analysis strategy. Five themes emerged from the data analysis include Reasons for becoming homeless; Social marginalization; Violence and Criminalization; Psychological distress; and Means of a living. Findings of this study illustrate that homeless youth suffered from poor health, sexual violence, psychological trauma, social stigma and hostility from the public. The combined effect of these precarious situations places homeless youth at the margins of society and makes them feel helpless in their daily lives. This study implies that social workers should use and promote family- and community-based interventions to deal with the problem of homeless youths and integrate them into society. © National Association of Social Workers-Zimbabwe/Author(s).",2023,,Afr.

"Risky sexual practice and associated factors among street children of Wonago town, Gedeo zone, Southern Ethiopia","Zenebe, G.A.; Alemu, W.; Muche, T.; Debela, B.G.","Introduction: A “risky sexual practice” is any sexual act that might put an individual’s social, physical, and psychological health at risk and increase the likelihood of adverse sexual and reproductive health consequences. Street children have risky sexual practices, which place them at all kinds of health risks. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess risky sexual practices and associated factors among street children in Wonago Town, southern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. About 214 street children, aged 10–18, residing in Wonago Town from September 1–30, 2021, participated in the study. Data was gathered from all of the street children in Wonago town. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Epi data software was used to enter the collected data, which was then exported to SPSS for analysis. A logistic regression model was applied to identify the associated factors. A p value <0.05 was used to declare the significant variables. Results: A total of 214 street children were involved in the study. Overall, the magnitude of risky sexual practices was 43.46 percent (95% CI: 38.3–48.62). About 52.7% of participants had ever had sexual intercourse in the last year, and of them, around 43.5% had more than one sexual partner. Among sexually active street children, 40.9% never used a condom during sexual intercourse. Age (Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR): 1.42, 95%CI: 1.03–2.37), educational status (AOR: 5.73, 95%CI: 1.49–10.51), substance use (AOR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.03–2.07), duration on the street (AOR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.03–4.12), and daily income (AOR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.32–0.98) were found to be significantly associated with risky sexual practices. Conclusion: Risky sexual practices among street children were more prevalent in Wonago Town, Southern Ethiopia. Children’s age, educational status, daily income, duration on the street, and status of substance use were the factors that contributed to risky sexual practices. As a result, conducting information and education campaigns, developing income-generating activities for children, increasing children’s school enrollment and attendance, improving access to sexual and reproductive health services, and providing capacity-building training for health care providers may all help to reduce risky sexual practices.

A global systematic scoping review of literature on the sexual exploitation of boys,"Moss, C.; Smith, S.J.; Kim, K.; Hua, N.; Noronha, N.; Kavenagh, M.; Wekerle, C.","Background: Sexual exploitation of children (SEC) is a widespread crime which impacts the child victim across developmental, health and well-being domains. As victims, boys have received much less clinical and research attention. While context-specific factors likely shape the SEC risk, under-recognized gender norms can deny boys' vulnerability. Professional failures to recognize and respond adequately to boys' sexual exploitation may prevent access to support. Objective: This systematic scoping review updates and broadens a previous review of literature addressing prevalence, victim/offender/facilitator characteristics, control mechanisms, as well as the health correlates and outcomes regarding sexual exploitation of boys. This review included international peer-reviewed and gray literature from 38 countries in 14 languages. Participants and setting: Studies from the years 2000 to 2022 that included samples of boys under age 18, or sex-disaggregated data for children under 18, were included. Case studies, systematic reviews, and those reporting on retrospective experiences by adults over 18 were excluded. A total of 254,744 boys were represented across 81 studies. Methods: A systematic scoping review considered qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed publications from eight, English-language databases. English and non-English non-peer reviewed publications (‘gray literature’) was identified by both ECPAT International's global network of member organizations and citation chaining. Results: Overall, 81 peer-reviewed (n = 51) and gray literature (n = 30) documents from 38 countries were included. In total, 254,744 youth participated in peer-reviewed studies (N = 217,726) and gray literature (N = 37,018). General prevalence of sexual exploitation of boys was reported at up to 5 %, with higher rates noted in specifically vulnerable sub-populations (e.g., 10 %, trans youth; 26 %, street-connected youth). The literature indicates that sexual exploitation of boys is reported as occurring primarily between 12 and 18 years old. Multi-level factors are linked to SEC, including individual (e.g., disability status), relationship (e.g., child maltreatment, dating violence), community (e.g., community violence), and societal domains (e.g., discriminatory beliefs). SEC victimization is linked with youth mental and physical health concerns, particularly sexual health. Post-traumatic stress symptomatology or disorder was rarely evaluated. Evidence-based treatments were not available, which may be related to a lack of gender-based theoretical models for understanding SEC specifically. Conclusion: The sexual exploitation of boys is a prevalent public health, child rights, and clinical issue. All young people experiencing sexual exploitation face sex- and gender-specific challenges, and this remains the case for boys with indications including family rejection, implicit community tolerance for abuse to service accessibility barriers. Actioning our duty to care for all children requires gender- and trauma-informed lenses. Ongoing surveillance of all forms of violence against children, with gender disaggregation, is essential for practice and policy advancement. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child Abuse Negl.,142,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106244,,#663,Moss 2023,,
Mental Health Service Experiences Among Transition-Age Youth: Interpersonal Continuums that Influence Engagement in Care,"McCormick, K.A.; Chatham, A.; Klodnick, V.V.; Schoenfeld, E.A.; Cohen, D.A.","Purpose. Transition-age youth (TAY) who have experienced or are experiencing complex trauma, system involvement and homelessness are at increased risk for serious mental health needs and related challenges. However, these vulnerable and historically marginalized TAY typically have low rates of mental health service engagement. This study examines how and why TAY experiencing system involvement, homelessness, and serious mental health and substance use symptoms engage in mental health services, and what facilitates and/or hinders their engagement in services. Methods. Twenty-one TAY completed a virtual interview about their previous and current mental health service experiences, and why they did or did not engage with mental health services. A modified grounded theory qualitative analysis approach was used to understand how participants’ personal sense of meaning interacted with programmatic factors to construct participant experiences with mental health services. Results. Most participants (81%, n = 17) received mental health services, namely psychiatry (76%, n = 16) and counseling/therapy (48%, n = 10), and peer support (10%, n = 2). Participants described their mental health service experiences along three interpersonal and relational continuums between themselves and their providers: feeling (mis)understood, being treated with (dis)respect, and experiencing (dis)trust. Discussion. Study findings reveal that for these particularly vulnerable and marginalized TAY, relational and interpersonal factors significantly influenced their engagement in mental health services. Study findings call for providers to re-imagine their working alliance with highly vulnerable TAY through culturally-attuned practices that promote understanding, respect, and trust. Findings also call for TAY-serving programs and policies to re-imagine peer support as a mental health service option for this highly vulnerable population. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Child Adolesc.

Examining these digital behaviors may provide useful data to design new digital health intervention models for youth experiencing homelessness. Specifically, passive data collection (data collected without extra steps for a user) may provide insights into lived experience and user needs without putting an additional burden on youth experiencing homelessness to inform digital health intervention design. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore patterns of mobile phone Wi-Fi usage and GPS location movement among youth experiencing homelessness. Additionally, we further examined the relationship between usage and location as correlated with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Methods: A total of 35 adolescent and young adult participants were recruited from the general community of youth experiencing homelessness for a mobile intervention study that included installing a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for up to 6 months. Of these participants, 19 had sufficient passive data to conduct analyses. At baseline, participants completed self-reported measures for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5]). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from phone location and usage data. Results: Almost all participants (18/19, 95%) used private networks for most of their noncellular connectivity. Greater Wi-Fi usage was associated with a higher PCL-5 score (P=.006). Greater location entropy, representing the amount of variability in time spent across identified clusters, was also associated with higher severity in both PCL-5 (P=.007) and PHQ-9 (P=.045) scores. Conclusions: Location and Wi-Fi usage both demonstrated associations with PTSD symptoms, while only location was associated with depression symptom severity. While further research needs to be conducted to establish the consistency of these findings, they suggest that the digital patterns of youth experiencing homelessness offer insights that could be used to tailor digital interventions. © Yousaf Ilyas, Shahrzad Hassanbeigi Daryani, Dona Kiriella, Paul Pachwicewicz, Randy A Boley, Karen M Reyes, Dale L Smith, Alyson K Zalta, Stephen M Schueller, Niranjan S Karnik, Colleen Stiles-Shields.",2023,,JMIR Form.

Through an interviewer-administered survey, YYSEH were asked about timing of tobacco use; exposure to causes of ABI; including brain oxygen deprivation (BOD; strangulation; accidental; choking games) and blunt force head trauma (BFHT; intentional; shaken violently; accidental); and perpetrators of intentional assault. Participants (n = 96) were on average 22 years old and from populations who experience structural disparities; including those minoritized by race (84.4%) and gender/sexual orientation (26.0%). In total, 87% of participants reported at least one exposure to BFHT and 65% to BOD. Intentional injury was more common than accidental. Furthermore, 60.4% of participants (n = 59) were classified as having ABI using the Brain Injury Severity Assessment.

The foremost objective is to understand their social and health conditions as vulnerable/at-risk street groups. The secondary goal is to identify the populations’ strengths, inspecting protection mechanisms, survival strategies and dreams. The data show a complex situation: experiences of trauma, violence, conflict and abandonment; ambivalent family ties, school drop-out, lack of legal and physical protection, homelessness, living below the limit of extreme poverty. The street has activated survival strategies, mostly on an individual level, but functioning as a “base system” the street seems to act as a protective system and a possible scenario in which to create a different future together with youth workers: reconnecting with the family, liaising with expert figures in order to return to school or look for suitable training.

"Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Students Experiencing Homelessness and Substance Use in the School Context: A Statewide Study","Moore, H.; De Pedro, K.","PURPOSE: This study explored differences between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)-housed and homeless students regarding substance use patterns on and off school grounds and the unique contribution of homelessness to substance use in school. METHODS: Data were from the 2013-2015 California Healthy Kids Survey, a statewide survey of school protective factors and risk behaviors. A representative sample of 9th- and 11th-grade students (N = 20,337) was used. Comparisons between housed (n = 19,456) and homeless (doubled up: n = 715; acute homeless: n = 166) LGB students were conducted. We used chi-square tests to compare rates of lifetime, past-30-day, and in-school substance use and conducted multivariate logistic regression models for each substance use variables. RESULTS: Chi-square test results indicated significant differences in rates of substance use among students experiencing homelessness (both categories) and housed LGB students. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students experiencing homelessness were more likely to report substance use off and on school grounds. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that LGB students who experience homelessness were significantly more likely to report recent and in-school substance use. For example, students experiencing acute homelessness were about 3 times as likely to report heavy episodic drinking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13, 4.26) and more than 5 times as likely to smoke marijuana in school (AOR = 5.38; 95% CI = 3.46, 8.36), compared to housed LGB students.

We followed these 57,509 individuals to age 18–19 years and compared ED presentations and hospital separations related to mental health, self-harm, drug and alcohol, injury, oral health, respiratory conditions, diabetes, pregnancy, and potentially preventable hospitalizations between those in contact and not in contact with SHS. Results: Four percent of young people had contact with SHS at ages 16–17 years. Young people who had contact with SHS were 2 and 3 times more likely to have presented to an ED and hospital respectively, compared to those who did not contact SHS. This accounted for 13% of all ED presentations and 16% of all hospitalizations in this age group. Excess burden causes included mental health, self-harm, drug and alcohol, diabetes, and pregnancy. On average, young people in contact with SHS experienced an increased length of stay in ED (+0.6 hours) and hospital (+0.7 days) per presentation, and were more likely to not wait for treatment in ED and to self-discharge from hospital. Discussion: The 4% of young people who contacted SHS at ages 16–17 years accounted for 13% and 16% of all ED presentations and hospitalizations respectively at age 18–19 years. Prioritizing access to stable housing and primary health-care services for adolescents in contact with SHS in Australia could improve health outcomes and reduce health-care costs. © 2023 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2023,,J.

"Demographic predictors of experiences of homelessness among lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, gender-diverse and queer-identifying (LGBTIQ) young people in Australia","Lim, G.; Melendez-Torres, G.J.; Amos, N.; Anderson, J.; Norman, T.; Power, J.; Jones, J.; Bourne, A.","Homelessness among young lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, gender-diverse and queer-identifying (LGBTQ+) persons is highly prevalent and constitutes a structural risk to health and future life chances. However, the distribution of homelessness burden is among different LGBTQ+ subgroups is poorly understood. An Australia-wide cross-sectional online survey was conducted involving 6,481 LGBTQ+ participants aged 14–21 years during 2019. Single-predictor logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with both lifetime and recent experiences of homelessness. Analyses also explored associations between recent (<12 months) experiences of homelessness, experiences of harassment, alcohol consumption, and psychological distress. Higher odds of experiencing homelessness were observed for trans and gender-diverse young people, individuals who identified with sexual identity labels other than lesbian, gay or bisexual, racially-minoritized persons, disabled persons and individuals from a religious family or household, compared to their respective counterparts. Experiencing homelessness was associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption and higher prevalence of experiencing verbal, physical and sexual harassment, but only modestly associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Homelessness risk and burden is unevenly distributed among LGBTQ+ youth and is linked to outcomes which may potentiate future homelessness. Interventions addressing homelessness among this group must be optimized for those subgroups most vulnerable to experiencing homelessness. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Casa 1, a site of LGBTQ memory in São Paulo, Brazil","Duarte, A.D.S.; Cymbalista, R.","The NGO Casa 1 was conceived as a housing project for runaway and homeless LGBTQ youths. Launched in 2017, it has expanded into a complex that includes housing, culture, education and health services. Together with this infrastructure of care, Casa 1 has created several strategies to promote LGBTQ memory that have made it a new site of memory in São Paulo. Through field research, interviews and analysis of institutional material, this article presents the NGO’s memory strategies in four directions: memorialisation as a symbolic mechanism of gratitude, exemplarity and denunciation, and the safeguarding of a LGBTQ memory collection. We argue that, through these dimensions, Casa 1 has consolidated itself as a site of memory even considering its short existence, showing that the establishment of a site of memory is not a passive consequence of time and historical events, but can be precipitated and induced, through intensity and intentionality. © The Author(s) 2022.",2023,,Mem.

Perspectives of Refugee Youth Experiencing Homelessness: A Qualitative Study of Factors Impacting Mental Health and Resilience,"Khan, B.M.; Waserman, J.; Patel, M.","Homeless refugee youth experience high rates of traumatic and adverse experiences, a significant burden of mental health needs, and compounded barriers in accessing support services. Despite this, there is a paucity of literature exploring the unique intersections and vulnerabilities faced by this subgroup. This study of Youth Without Shelter (YWS), an emergency residence and referral agency serving homeless youth in Toronto, Canada was a qualitative study of homeless refugee youth. Research goals were to describe the mental health needs and identify the factors contributing to the resiliency of refugee youth experiencing homelessness. Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews with YWS youth (n = 6) and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis with a realist lens. Results highlighted that the mental health of refugee youth experiencing homelessness was subject to system-level factors such as the immigration process (n = 6), housing insecurity (n = 5), finances (n = 5), education (n = 6), employment (n = 6) and sense of safety (n = 4), with acculturative stress, including culture shock (n = 3) and language (n = 4), also have negative effects. Goal directedness (n = 5), independence or responsibility (n = 4), and nurturing social connectedness with family (n = 5), peers (n = 6), and community (n = 4) contributed to participants' resilience. A model for planning future interventions was proposed and was informed by the lived experience of participants. This model focuses on initially on immediate and basic needs and reflected evidence gathered through this work to attend to long-term needs once individuals have integrated into society. Future efforts will be directed toward translating the lived experience of this population and developing practice guidelines to optimize care.

The Precariat That Can Speak The Politics of Encounters between the Educated Youth and the Urban Poor in Seoul,"Cho, M.Y.","In this article, I explore how different groups of the precariat endure and struggle with specific and hierarchical forms of precarity in Seoul. By paying attention to which precarity matters, and to whom it belongs, I examine the friction between the educated youth—the “deserving” precariat that can speak—and the urban poor, who endure abandonment. This collaborative project, in which university students encountered welfare recipients and homeless people through interviews with antipoverty activists, unveils the complex reality that one group’s attempt to react to their precarity risks marginalizing or exacerbating the precarity faced by another group. The affective discourses of fairness and security, which are often embodied and fetishized by precarious youth who are struggling to survive, turn out to have fostered a deeper marginalization and criminalization of the urban poor. Instead of reducing this finding to a critique of the differential distribution of precarity, I reposition my ethnography as an experimental and pedagogical project, in which an anthropologist’s “field” is created with the expansion of research inquiries, findings, reflections, and actions. As such, ethnography serves as a kind of activism to connect the bounded circles of the precariat and demonstrate new predicaments and possibilities in an open-ended manner. © 2022 The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Reciprocal associations between housing instability and youth criminal legal involvement: a scoping review,"Almquist, L.; Walker, S.C.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness have disproportionate contact with the criminal legal system. This system contact represents a critical inflection point for enhancing risk or opportunities for stabilization; however, the policy and scholarly traditions examining the criminal legal system have not traditionally incorporated housing or other social determinants as a central focus of intervention. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA-ScR guidelines to examine how the research literature is currently addressing housing within the context of youth involvement in the legal system. Databases searched included PubMed, Web of Science, and Academic Search Complete. Google Scholar was used to identify papers not indexed in the academic databases of interest. Database searches were conducted between September and December 2019 and articles were restricted to those published in English between the year 2000 and 2019. Key study components extracted included demographic information regarding each sample, type of article, study methodology, direction of effects of interest, outcome measures and primary findings, as well as theoretical frameworks engaged by the authors. Results: The search results returned 2154 titles for review. After screening all 2154 titles, 75 met eligibility for inclusion. Abstract reviews were conducted for all 75 papers. 36 abstracts met eligibility criteria and underwent full-text review. Ultimately, 29 articles satisfied eligibility criteria and were included in this scoping review. Conclusions: Publications are primarily focused on the social epidemiology of risk factors and behaviors determining youth justice contact, but relatively less so on studies of interventions targeting youth delinquency, crime reduction, or recidivism that included housing support. The lack of continuity in theorizing from epidemiology to applied science in this area represents a gap in the literature that is likely reducing the effectiveness of interventions to interrupt patterns of legal system contact for youth. Integrating a public health framework that emphasizes the upstream social determinants leading to contact with the youth justice system would represent a paradigm shift for the field that would have beneficial effects on long term health outcomes for youth. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Health Justice,10,1,,,10.1186/s40352-022-00177-7,,#691,Almquist 2022,,
Design and delivery of a need-based mental health promotion program for shelter-home adolescents,"Soni, J.; Jijina, P.","Background: India has a large population of adolescents living in shelter homes. However, there is a scarcity of empirical literature on mental health promotion programs developed to suit their unique needs. Aim: The aim of this research was to design a need-based mental health promotion program for runaway and homeless adolescents living in a shelter home in Vadodara, India. Methods: To gain a holistic understanding into their mental health issues and felt needs, semi-structured interviews were conducted with these adolescents along with key stakeholders such as their care takers, counselors, and teachers. The key needs identified pertained to issues related to academics, reduction of substance abuse, anger management, and emotional regulation. On the basis of identified needs, a training program of 13 sessions was developed using indigenous technique of Yoga and techniques from literature of subjective well-being and life skills. Total sample included 35 male adolescents from 12 to 18 years of age. Participants were randomly divided into experimental group (n = 19) and control group (n = 16). Pre- and post-intervention assessment was performed using Academic Stress Scale, State Trait Anxiety Scale, Children and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, and Children Depression Inventory. Results: The results indicated that trait anxiety was significantly reduced, and there was a significant increase in mindfulness in the intervention group. However, there was no significant improvement in depression and academic stress. Discussion: The observations from this study are detailed to sensitize researchers toward the design and delivery of mental health promotion programs for institutionalized youth. © 2022 The Author(s).",2022,,Indian J.

Substance use treatment using cultural arts and 12 steps: Curriculum training and community-led implementation in Zambia,"Lorenz, H.S.; Stuebing, M.D.; Nambeye, C.; Lungu, G.; Littlefield, L.M.","Introduction: Substance use in Zambia is stigmatized and treatment access is limited. Over 30,000 people are homeless in Lusaka, where one-quarter of homeless youth report use. Zambia's Ministry of Health recently developed policies targeting alcohol, suggesting Chainama, the only mental health hospital, offer treatment. Together, they endorsed training in the curriculum studied in this paper. We hypothesized training Zambian professionals would improve their perceptions of substance users and treatment. We then explored if treatment using the curriculum, as delivered to clients by training participants, would encourage client motivation to change, participation in groups, and reduce substance use frequency. Methods: Part 1: One-hundred professionals were trained in a curriculum-based, literacy-free intervention employing cognitive behavioral and rational emotive behavior therapy techniques to explore 12 Steps of addiction recovery through Zambian art forms. Pre/post questionnaires captured perspectives around substance users and treatment. Part 2: Trained organizations delivered the curriculum in their communities. Twenty-five organizations rated feasibility and benefit of the curriculum. Data for 200 clients recorded pre/post motivation to change, open-sharing/participation, and frequency of substance use. Results: While training significantly modified professionals’ perspectives regarding the value of offering treatment, their views of substance users did not change. Clients endorsed increases in “motivation to change” and “participation/open-sharing.” Frequency of alcohol, marijuana, inhalant, and cigarette use significantly decreased. Conclusion: Training in the curriculum helped address a public health need, playing a role in increased motivational variables and decreased substance use.

Income assistance use among young adults who were in British Columbia special education: A longitudinal cohort study,"Scott, C.W.M.; Russell, M.J.; Tough, S.; Zwicker, J.D.","Background Persons with disability (PWD) experience disproportionately high poverty rates in Canada. This trend is apparent especially among youth compared to those who develop disabilities later in life. PWD in poverty have additional needs that increase barriers to full participation in society and translate to higher basic costs for daily living. Despite the existence of income assistance programs in Canada to mitigate income inequalities faced by PWDs, access to these programs can be limited. Objective To describe use of income assistance for young adults with disability in British Columbia for the development of potential approaches to improve realized access to these programs. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using British Columbia linked administrative data. We described differences in income assistance use among PWD by the level of special education funding received during primary school education (from most to least; Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Unfunded, and no special education) and family composition. We also provided longitudinal patterns of income assistance use. Results Of 218,324 young adults, 88% received no special education, 0.1% used Level One, 1.6% used Level Two, 2.9% used Level Three, and 7.1% used Unfunded special education coding. Young adults with Level One special education funding had the highest rates of hospitalizations and continuing care, with no hospitalization due to homelessness. Those with Level Three special education coding had higher rates of hospitalization and hospitalization due to; homelessness than Level Two young adults. When transitioning to adulthood initially, Level One and Two funded individuals used relatively more disability income assistance than individuals from the other funding levels. Nearly all BCEA users with higher funded special education codes used this disability-specific program, while lesser funded special education codes used the Temporary Assistance more frequently, for a longer duration and were more likely to be persistent Temporary Assistance users. Conclusions Sustainable and reliable access to income assistance programs remains an issue across the heterogeneity of needs faced by young adults with disability. © 2022 Scott et al.

The research team used SNA to assess the level of connectivity of three different community coalitions. While research questions were slightly different for each collaborative, each project asked about the frequency of communication between organizations to determine connectivity. Results vary between case examples.

Homelessness at the San Diego Central Library: Assessing the Potential Role of Social Workers,"Urada, L.A.; Nicholls, M.J.; Faille, S.R.","Nationwide, public libraries are experiencing an increase in “on-premise” opioid overdoses and other issues (e.g., suicide attempts) affecting unstably housed library users. The public library presents a unique opportunity to access an otherwise hidden population. In partnership with the San Diego Central Library, researchers led focus groups, in-depth interviews, and surveys with 63 library patrons experiencing homelessness or housing instability (n = 49) and library staff (n = 14) (January–June 2019). Using a consensus organizing framework and mixed methods approach, the researchers conducted in-depth interviews exploring the library’s strengths and opportunities for patrons experiencing homelessness, the barriers to meeting their aspirations, and whether having a social worker at the library or other policy changes in government or the library could help. Specifically, participants answered inquiries about the opportunities for the library to address substance use and human trafficking. In brief surveys, library patrons and staff provided views on the patrons’ educational needs, library staff’s training needs, and changes needed in government or library policies. Results revealed the desire of the library patrons (69%) and staff (93%) to have a library social worker who could link patrons to housing services, substance use harm reduction or treatment, and address food-insecure youth/families and human trafficking/sexual exploitation. Participants also valued peer advocates with lived homelessness experiences. Over 70% of the unstably housed patrons said they would like library patrons to participate in peer leadership training. Other significant themes were the need for crisis prevention and intervention, connecting patrons to resources and each other, and creating consistent assistance. Libraries urgently need more on-premise support to address patrons’ pressing housing, health, and mental health needs. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Int. J. Environ. Res.

"“I feel like I’m in a revolving door, and COVID has made it spin a lot faster”: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Canada","Noble, A.; Owens, B.; Thulien, N.; Suleiman, A.","Purpose Research has shown that youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face barriers to social inclusion and are at risk for poor mental health. With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening the health, wellbeing, and economic circumstances of people around the world, this study aims to assess the impacts of the pandemic on YEH in Toronto, Ontario, as well as to identify recommendations for future waves of COVID-19. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with YEH (ages 16–24, n = 45) and staff who work in one of four downtown emergency shelters for youth (n = 31) in Toronto, Ontario. Results YEH experienced both structural changes and psychosocial impacts resulting from the pandemic. Structural changes included a reduction in services, barriers to employment and housing, and changes to routines. Psychosocial outcomes included isolation, worsened mental health, and increased substance use. Impacts were magnified and distinct for subpopulations of youth, including for youth that identified as Black, 2SLGBTQ+, or those new to Canada. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic increased distress among YEH while also limiting access to services. There is therefore a need to balance health and safety with continued access to in-person services, and to shift the response to youth homelessness to focus on prevention, housing, and equitable supports for subpopulations of youth. © 2022 Noble et al.

"Initiation of opioid agonist treatment and subsequent substance use and other patterns among adolescents and young adults in Vancouver, Canada","Pilarinos, A.; Fast, D.; Nosova, E.; Kwa, Y.; Joe, R.; Buxton, J.A.; DeBeck, K.","Background: Opioid agonist treatments (OAT) are effective interventions for reducing illicit opioid use; however, less is known about OAT among adolescents and young adults (AYA). This study sought to examine OAT retention and discontinuation among AYA. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street-involved AYA in Vancouver, Canada, between September 2005 and December 2018. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was employed to identify sociodemographic, substance use, and other factors associated with time to first OAT. Substance use, homelessness, service utilization, and criminal justice patterns among AYA who did and did not initiate OAT were examined using before and after analysis. Results: Of 676 AYA who reported weekly illicit opioid use, 454 (67.2%) reported not being on OAT at some point over the study period and 217 (32.1%) initiated OAT over follow-up. In non-linear growth curve analysis, only participants retained in OAT demonstrated significant reductions in daily illicit opioid use when compared to ‘no OAT’ controls (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, reductions in homelessness (p = 0.070) and increases in difficulty accessing services (p = 0.078) were observed between participants retained in OAT vs. ‘no OAT’ controls, while reductions in homelessness (p = 0.085) and weekly non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) (p = 0.061) were observed between ‘OAT discontinuers’ vs. ‘no OAT’ controls. Conclusions: Despite finding that OAT retention was associated with significant reductions in daily illicit opioid use, no significant improvements in other key indicators were observed. This underscores the importance of providing supports alongside OAT to improve treatment outcomes among AYA. © 2022",2022,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,235,,,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109441,,#713,Pilarinos 2022,,
"Accelerated adulthood, extended adolescence and the care cliff: Supporting care leavers' transition from care to independent living","Palmer, A.; Norris, M.; Kelleher, J.","The pressures of ‘accelerated adulthood’ are a critical challenge for young people ageing out of the care system. Despite the trauma related to their placement history, young people ‘aging out’ are expected to adapt to adulthood at younger age and faster pace than their non-care peers, who enjoy an ‘extended adolescence’ a far more gradual progression into adulthood than previous generations. This article draws on first-person narratives of care leavers in Ireland who have aged out of care and transitioned into independent living in a dedicated social housing programme to examine their strategies for coping with these competing pressures. It examines their worries about the sudden withdrawal of supports after they reach 18 years, which they characterized as a ‘care cliff’. The emotional and practical challenges they faced when transitioning to independent living at a comparatively young age are explored, and strategies for mitigating these are identified. These include better preparing care leavers for this transition, maintaining supports for longer and withdrawing them in a more gradual way, which is tailored to meet the specific needs of each care leaver and grounded in more comprehensive after care planning than has been the norm in Ireland. © 2022 The Authors.

Revictimization Patterns Among Unhoused Youth,"Wright, N.M.; Milligan, T.; Bender, K.; DePrince, A.P.","Young people experiencing houselessness are at high risk for revictimization. As has been identified in other populations, symptoms of psychological distress may be an indirect pathway by which initial victimization may increase risk for later revictimization among youth experiencing houselessness. The current study used cross-sectional mediation analyses to examine the hypothesis that there would be an indirect effect of interpersonal victimization that occurred before young people left home on subsequent victimization while experiencing houselessness, through posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms. Youth (N = 245) residing in a shelter provided responses during an in-person interview screening prior to participating in a larger clinical study. Relevant to the current study, youth reported victimization experiences before and after leaving home (Childhood Trauma and Juvenile Victimization Questionnaires, respectively), and PTSD and depression symptoms on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results replicated and extended previous findings determining high rates of victimization among houseless young people both before (92%) and after (75%) leaving home. Further, exposure to more types of childhood victimization significantly predicted likelihood of experiencing more types of victimization after leaving home. Significant indirect effects of childhood victimization risk on revictimization after leaving home were found, occurring through both PTSD and depression symptoms. Results are discussed in terms of existing theories of revictimization, with particular emphasis on the state-dependence theory of victimization. These findings have implications for intervention with young people experiencing houselessness, particularly with regard to addressing the consequences of childhood victimization and trauma-informed support systems. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",2022,,J.

Tenant-based housing voucher programs (voucher programs) limit rent to 30% or less of household income to help households with low income obtain safe and affordable housing. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of voucher programs in improving housing, health, and other health-related outcomes for households with low income. Design: Community Guide systematic review methods were used to assess intervention effectiveness and threats to validity. An updated systematic search based on a previous Community Guide review was conducted for literature published from 1999 to July 2019 using electronic databases. Reference lists of included studies were also searched. Eligibility Criteria: Studies were included if they assessed voucher programs in the United States, had concurrent comparison populations, assessed outcomes of interest, were written in English, and published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports. Main Outcome Measures: Housing quality and stability, neighborhood opportunity (safety and poverty), education, income, employment, physical and mental health, health care use, and risky health behavior. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Compared with low-income households not offered vouchers, voucher-using households reported increased housing quality (7.9 percentage points [pct pts]), decreased housing insecurity or homelessness (-22.4 pct pts), and decreased neighborhood poverty (-5.2 pct pts). Adults in voucher-using households had improved health care access and physical and mental health. Female youth experienced better physical and mental health but not male youth. Children who entered the voucher programs under 13 years of age had improved educational attainment, employment, and income in their adulthood; children's gains in these outcomes were inversely related to their age at program entry. Conclusion: Voucher programs improved health and several health-related outcomes for voucher-using households, particularly young children. Research is still needed to better understand household's experiences and contextual factors that influence achievement of desired outcomes. © 2022 Journal of Public Health Management and Practice.

Adolescent homelessness: Evaluating victimization risk based on LGBT identity and sleeping location,"Flatley, C.A.; Hatchimonji, D.R.; Treglia, D.; Cutuli, J.J.","Background: Teen homelessness confers risk for victimization experiences, and teens that identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) are at an even greater risk of experiencing victimization and homelessness. Methods: Using the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, we evaluated the association of experiencing homelessness with physical and sexual victimization and we examined whether LGBT identification moderated this relationship. We also evaluated if the odds of experiencing sexual and physical victimization differed depending on the reported sleeping location. Results: Students who reported homelessness had increased odds of having experienced physical and sexual victimization. LGBT identity was related to increased risk for physical and sexual victimization; however, LGBT identity did not moderate the relationship between homelessness and victimization. Considering nighttime sleeping arrangement, students who reported having no usual place to stay had the highest odds of experiencing sexual or physical victimization, followed by car, park, campground, hotels/motels, emergency housing, and doubled-up with family or friends. Notably, all homeless sleeping locations were associated with increased odds of experiencing victimization relative to sleeping at a parent or guardian's home. Conclusions: Our findings confirm links between teen homelessness and sexual and physical victimization, as well as increased risk for victimization experienced by LGBT youth. Special considerations should be made when developing and implementing interventions for teens experiencing homelessness and teens who identify as LGBT. © 2022 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.",2022,,J.

"“Companion, friend, four-legged fluff ball”: The power of pets in the lives of LGBTQ+ young people experiencing homelessness","Schmitz, R.M.; Carlisle, Z.T.; Tabler, J.","Experiences of homelessness are challenging for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+) young people. LGBTQ+ young adults without stable housing endure mental health struggles stemming from multiple structural disadvantages. In navigating stressors, LGBTQ+ young people may develop bonds with companion animals, or pets. Demonstrating the diverse ways LGBTQ+ young adults manage mental health challenges while homeless, we qualitatively analyzed the narratives of 17 LGBTQ+ young adults (18–25) surrounding their pet relationships. Participants emphasized the positive power of pets in their lives to help offset stressors. These findings illustrate how marginalized young people manage their mental health through informal resources. Incorporating companion animals could potentially enhance services for LGBTQ+ youth experiencing marginalization. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,,Sexualities,25,6-May,694-716,,10.1177/1363460720986908,,#732,Schmitz 2022,,
Perceived safety in community and service settings among young adults experiencing homelessness: Differences by sexual and gender identity,"DiGuiseppi, G.; Semborski, S.; Rhoades, H.; Goldbach, J.; Henwood, B.F.","Homelessness poses risks to the health and safety of young adults; particularly among sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults. The current study sought to better understand service use and perceived safety in community and service settings among SGM and cisgender heterosexual (cis-hetero) young adults experiencing homelessness. Data come from a mixed-method, ecological momentary assessment study (n = 80; 43% sexual minority; 10% gender minority) in Los Angeles, California. Participants reported their current location (service vs. nonservice setting) and perceived safety. Multilevel modeling examined associations between identity, location, and perceived safety; qualitative interviews with 20 SGM participants added context to quantitative findings. Overall, service location was associated with greater perceived safety (β =.27, p <.001). Compared to cis-hetero participants, cisgender sexual minorities (β = −.23, p =.03) and sexual and gender minorities (β = −.50, p =.002) reported lower perceived safety in service settings (vs. nonservice settings).

Variability in treatment outcomes from a housing intervention for young mothers misusing substances and experiencing homelessness by sexual identity,"Mallory, A.B.; Luthy, E.; Martin, J.K.; Slesnick, N.","Sexual minority (SM) youth have twice the risk of experiencing homelessness compared to their heterosexual peers. Further, SM youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report greater depression symptoms and substance use compared to heterosexual YEH. Housing First is an intervention that provides scattered-site individual apartments, without any prerequisite conditions for eligibility, and additional services to support long-term housing sustainment; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for SM youth. The current study utilized data from a RCT that provided housing to young mothers experiencing homelessness to examine if treatment effects varied by mothers’ sexual identity. Mothers were randomly assigned to services as usual (i.e., provided a referral sheet of all services available in the community; SAU), Housing only (i.e., three months of utility and rental assistance; Housing), or housing and supportive services (integrates independent housing, Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), HIV prevention, and substance use/mental health counseling; Housing + SS). Latent growth curve models were estimated to assess how substance use and depression symptoms changed over the 12 months. SM mothers receiving SAU or Housing did not experience a significant change in substance use or depression symptoms. All groups of heterosexual mothers and SM mothers receiving Housing + SS had less substance use and depression symptoms at twelve months, with SM mothers in Housing + SS evidencing a steeper decline in substance use and depression symptoms. This study provides some of the first evidence that Housing First can mitigate the mental health and substance use concerns of SM YEH. Given SM's higher rates of homelessness, substance use, and depression symptoms, Housing First should be further explored as an intervention to address their unique needs. © 2022",2022,,Child.

Response Patterns to Weekly Short Message Service Health Surveys Among Diverse Youth at High Risk for Acquiring HIV,"Tang, W.; Gunn, H.J.; Kwok, S.; Comulada, W.S.; Arnold, E.M.; Swendeman, D.; Fernández, M.I.","HIV researchers use short messaging service (SMS)-based surveys to monitor health behaviors more closely than what would be possible with in-person assessment. Benefits are tempered by nonresponse to completing surveys. Understanding response patterns and their associated study participant characteristics would guide more tailored use of SMS-based surveys for HIV studies. We examined response to weekly 7-item SMS surveys administered as part of an HIV prevention trial. Using Mixture hidden Markov models (MHMM), we identified the underlying response patterns shared by subgroups of participants over time and quantified the association between these response patterns and participant characteristics. Three underlying response patterns were identified; responders, responders with phone-related errors, and non-responders. Non-responders versus responders were more likely to be younger, male, cis-gender, Black and Latinx participants with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and social support service utilization. Responders with phone-related errors compared to non-responders were more likely to be Black, Latinx, female, students, and have a history of incarceration and social support service utilization. More nuanced results from MHMM analyses better inform what strategies to use for increasing SMS response rates, including assisting in securing phone ownership/service for responders with phone-related errors and identifying alternative strategies for non-responders. Actively collecting and monitoring non-delivery notification data available from SMS gateway service companies offers another opportunity to identify and connect with participants when they are willing but unable to respond during follow-up. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,AIDS Behav.,26,7,2229-2241,,10.1007/s10461-021-03569-2,,#741,Tang 2022,,
"Initiation into the street, challenges, means of survival and perceived strategies to prevent plights among street children in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 2019: A phenomenological study design","Chimdessa, A.","Background The life and health of street children are becoming a global concern. Push and pull factors i.e. poverty, family death, economic decline, child abuse, financial independence, and peer influence draw children into the street. The street lives by itself pushes them into sex work, and lack of shelter magnificent abuses, where both sexes have the same sleeping quarters. Materials and Methods A phenomenological study design was employed from January to March 2019 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Time-Space Sampling (TSS) was used to recruit participants into the study. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and individual in-depth interview were used to collect data. Data analyzed by using framework analysis software. Results About 103 participants took part in the study. Finding shows street children are encountering widespread challenges like social network fragmentation, child trafficking, harassments, and shortage of basic needs. Furthermore, poor design of comprehensive, contextualized strategies and less political value worsening the problems. They are considered as a felon, outlaws, and having a mentality of committing a crime by both law-keeping bodies and society. This situation resulted in fewer acceptances of street children by the community, and less legal protection by law that made them more at risk for denial of social protection. Street children positively perceived strategies like Income Generating Activities (IGAs), shelter, community support, child protection, and access to education, health services, life coaching, and less extent re-integration strategies to address their problems. Conclusion The study shows street children are defenseless to harassments and denial of social protection services. Poorly designed policies, strategies targeting them, less political values, and traditional response by government has been subjugated, which made them prone to health and social problems. Therefore, finding might be beneficial to health data scientists, and policymakers; to design and implement policies, and strategic plans in addressing, and preventing their plights. © 2022 Ayana Chimdessa.

Prevalence of alcohol consumption in most at-risk groups in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Hosseinkhani, Z.; Mohammadkhanloo, M.; Zamanian, M.; Moradzadeh, R.; Ramezani, M.; Cheraghi, Z.; Bagheri, H.; Jafari, E.; Osooli, M.","Introduction: Many studies have assessed the prevalence of alcohol consumption in Iran. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of alcohol consumption in different groups. Material and Methods: We searched international and databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and we searched two main Farsi-language index databases including Scientific Information Database (SID) and the Irandoc. Grey literature search was also performed in Google Scholar, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses without time limit until June 2020. All studies that reported the prevalence of alcohol consumption among Iranians were included in current study. Results: From 9,038 screened studies, 109 studies with 925,480 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of alcohol consumption was estimated 24% (95% CI: 18.0–31.0), 12% (95%CI: 10.0–14.0), 14% (95%CI: 13.0–15.0), 19% (95%CI: 13.0–26.0), 15% (95%CI: 3.0–28.0) among prisoners, general population, students, drivers, and street children, respectively. Conclusion: This systematic review indicated higher prevalence of alcohol consumption in prisoners, drivers, and street children than the general population and other subgroups. The distribution of the alcohol prevalence studies in different groups and provinces were heterogeneous.

Using scenario videos with Theatre Testing method to adapt a peer navigation model to improve street-connected youth's access to HIV care in Kenya and Canada,"MacEntee, K.; Lee, E.O.J.; Oudshoorn, A.; Abramovich, A.; Kiptui, R.; Ayuku, D.; Van Berkum, A.; Saarela, O.; Tang, T.-S.; Apondi, E.; Wachira, J.; MacDonald, S.-A.; Braitstein, P.","Theatre testing (TT) method demonstrates whole or portions of an evidence-based intervention to stakeholders to elicit feedback on context-specific adaptations and future implementation. The Peer Navigator Project (PNP) studied the adaptation and implementation of Peer Navigators in five urban sites to increase street-connected youth (SCY) access to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment in Canada and Kenya. TT was used with SCY, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders to collect feedback on the optimal characteristics of the PNs (e.g., social identities) and their professional activities and responsibilities in each site. Sites scripted unique scenarios of PNs supporting SCY and interacting with social service providers. Local actors were employed, and the scenarios were filmed and edited into videos alongside audience discussion questions. Videos were screened to separate audiences of SCY (n = 40), healthcare providers (n = 12), and community stakeholders (n = 59). Facilitated discussion about the scenarios were recorded as data, and transcripts were analyzed thematically by the research team. The scenario videos are presented as a unique adaptation to the TT method. The adaptations were time-consuming and limited the ability to present responsive changes while presenting the method to different audiences. They were also effective at maintaining presentation fidelity and eliciting diverse and meaningful responses from different stakeholder groups. One site successfully adapted the method for use in a physically distanced manner that complied with COVID-19 public health regulations. TT using video scenarios is an engaging approach that garners rich responses from diverse stakeholder groups about the adaptation of evidence-based interventions preparing for implementation in international settings.

Youth resilience and training programmes in Australia and the US: Beyond neoliberal social therapeutics,"Campbell, P.; Howie, L.; Moussa, B.; Mason, C.; Joyce, A.","In a world where opportunities are increasingly limited, young people are encouraged to become resilient and entrepreneurial in their pursuit of the traditional markers of adulthood. Social enterprise and community organisations dedicated to supporting young people seek to recast these expectations by providing supportive work and training environments and cultures and encouraging young people to find passion and hope in economic conditions that have failed to deliver the security and wellbeing that was promised. These organisations identify and respond to complex issues like unemployment and disengagement, homelessness and housing precarity, and provide personal development, support, education, training and employment options. In this paper, we explore how youth-focused social enterprise and community organisation programmes shape dispositions of resilience and entrepreneurialism. Drawing on the work of Butler and Anthanasiou and Dey and Mason, we argue that social organisations re-imagine the ‘social therapeutics’ that young people may require in relation to their participation in neoliberal forms of governmentality. We hope to challenge conceptualisations of such interventions as purely bounded by neoliberal and pro-capitalist therapeutic logics, by identifying the complex and sometimes contradictory goals that community organisations and social enterprises work towards in supporting young people to navigate a precarious economic landscape. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,J.

"Adverse childhood experiences, associated stressors and comorbidities in children and youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder across the justice and child protection settings in Western Australia","Tan, G.K.Y.; Symons, M.; Fitzpatrick, J.; Connor, S.G.; Cross, D.; Pestell, C.F.","Background: Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at risk of having adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), especially those with child protection and/or justice system involvement. The complex relationship between FASD and psychosocial vulnerabilities in the affected individual is an important clinical risk factor for comorbidity. This study (1) explored the ACEs and associated stressors in individuals with FASD; (2) investigated the association between ACEs and negative outcomes, i.e., justice/child protection system involvement; and (3) examined the relationship between ACEs and comorbid conditions such as mood and neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively via file review from diagnostic clinics in Western Australia. Life adversity was coded using a standardised ACEs questionnaire. A total of 211 participants (72% males) with FASD with a mean age of 11 years (range = 2–21) were included in the final sample. 70% of the total sample had been involved with the child protection system and 40% had trouble with the law. Results: Exposure to drinking/substance misuse at home (70%) and domestic violence (52%) were the two most common ACEs across the total sample. In the entire cohort, 39% had four or more ACEs, indicating higher risks of poor health outcomes. Additional stressors recorded were disengagement from school (43%), transiency (19%), victims of bullying (12%), traumatic brain injury (9%) and homelessness (5%). ACEs such as drinking/substance misuse at home, emotional neglect and physical neglect were positively associated with child protection system involvement. Additionally, exposure to domestic violence was positively correlated with justice system involvement. Higher rates of life adversity in this clinical population were associated with an increased number of comorbidities. Specifically, those with FASD who had comorbidities such as attachment disorder, substance use disorder, and PTSD also reported higher ACEs scores. Conclusion: ACEs were common in this clinical population. Increased ACEs in this sample were associated with increased comorbidities and involvement with the child protection and/or justice system. This highlights that prevention, intervention and early diagnosis of FASD are important for at risk children to reduce the negative effects of ACEs. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Pediatr.,22,1,,,10.1186/s12887-022-03654-y,,#748,Tan 2022,,
"Migration, personal physical safety and economic survival: drivers of risky sexual behaviour among rural–urban migrant street youth in Kampala, Uganda","Bwambale, M.F.; Birungi, D.; Moyer, C.A.; Bukuluki, P.; van den Borne, B.","Background: Despite the vulnerabilities associated with the youth migration process, knowledge on the drivers of risky sexual behaviour among migrant street youth is limited. This study sought to explore the pathways driving risky sexual behaviour among rural–urban migrant street youth in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: We conducted 11 focus-group discussions composed of 8–10 participants each, and 15 in-depth interviews with urban street adolescents and youth aged 12–24 years. We purposively recruited street youth who had migrated from other districts to Kampala, Uganda, and who identified themselves as street youth. Data were analysed thematically using an inductive approach facilitated by Dedoose software. Results: The migration journey acted as a catalyst for risky sexual behaviour among the adolescents and youth moving from rural districts to Kampala. Three primary pathways were found to drive risky sexual behaviour of street youth: 1) rural–urban migration itself, through sexual exploitation of and violence toward street youth especially young girls during movement, 2) economic survival through engaging in casual jobs and sex work upon arrival in the city, and 3) personal physical safety through friendships and networks, which consequently lead to having multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex. Engagement in risky sexual behaviour, especially sex work, was found to be an adaptation to the challenging and complex street life within the city. Conclusions: This study highlights the migration process, personal physical safety and economic survival as major pathways driving risky sexual behaviour among rural–urban street youth in Kampala. Interventions to improve sexual health, physical safety and protection of street youth during the migration process and within the city spaces should be prioritised. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Public Health,22,1,,,10.1186/s12889-022-13516-y,,#750,Bwambale 2022,,
Understanding the Health and Health-Related Social Needs of Youth Experiencing Homelessness: A Photovoice Study,"Damian, A.J.; Ponce, D.; Ortiz-Siberon, A.; Kokan, Z.; Curran, R.; Azevedo, B.; Gonzalez, M.","Purpose: Homelessness is a major public health problem facing millions of youths across the United States (U.S.), with lesbian gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ+) youths and youths of color being disproportionately at higher risk. This study obtains an understanding of the health and health-related social needs of youths experiencing homelessness during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A total of 14 youths between the ages of 14 and 24 who (a) lived, worked, or attended school in New Britain, Connecticut (CT) and (b) had at least one experience of homelessness or housing insecurity worked with the research team to conduct a needs assessment regarding youth homelessness. Using photovoice, a community-based participatory research method, participants created photo narratives to share their stories and recommendations for community change. The main goals of photovoice are to enable participants to (1) record and represent their everyday realities; (2) promote critical dialogue and knowledge about person and community strengths and concerns; and (3) reach policy makers. Results: Most of the participants identified as youths of color, and half of the participants identified as members of the LGBTQ+ community. Three major themes that appeared in the youths’ narratives include the following: mental health and substance use challenges, trouble accessing basic human needs, and lack of a social support system. Conclusion: This study uplifts and empowers a vulnerable population to increase visibility around a major public health challenge from their own lived experiences. Despite the challenges that were voiced, many participants shared a sense of hope and resiliency. The major themes endorsed by the youths has the potential of informing practitioners and policy makers of how to better address the needs of youths experiencing homelessness, particularly those most at risk. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Int.

"Former street-working boys in Iraq highlight the importance of receiving education, training and support from families and other adults","Taib, N.I.; Öster, C.; Ramklint, M.","Aim: This study investigated the perceptions of men who worked on the streets of Iraq when they were children. It looked at the risks they faced, how they developed resilience and what support they feel current working children need. Methods: In 2021, semi-structured interviews were held with 40 men aged 24–33 who used to work on the streets as children. They had attended the Zewa Centre, a drop-in centre for street-working children in 2004–2005. Thematic analysis was used to explore the transcribed interviews. Results: Positive feedback focused on how they developed working and social skills and felt proud to support their families. Negative feedback included the consequences on their social lives and mental and physical health. Their suggestions for preventing street work in children were financial support, so that families could send their children back to school, and programmes that offer social skills training and vocational training. Social support from families, other adults and peers was very important. Conclusion: Working on the streets had positive and negative consequences and support from family and friends influenced the men's attitudes in adulthood. They suggested that financial support, education and social and vocational training would be very important for today's street-working children. © 2022 The Authors.

Over a third of the sample reported having been sex trafficked, and of those, over half were LGBTQ+. Further, amongst the sample, the odds of being LGBTQ+ and sex trafficked were two times higher compared to being heterosexual. Sex trafficked LGBTQ+ homeless young adults were found to be significantly more likely to report exchanging sex for money and were also found to have reported higher rates of challenging life experiences, including suicide attempts, drug use, risk-taking, and being raped between ages 13–17 compared to sex trafficked heterosexual homeless young adults.

Associations of mental illness and homelessness: results of a secondary data analysis at a Berlin health center for the homeless,"Knörle, U.; Gutwinski, S.; Willich, S.N.; Berghöfer, A.","Background: Homelessness is an expression and consequence of a complex problem situation that poses major challenges to the medical and social care systems in Germany. About three quarters of homeless people suffer from mental illness. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between mental illness and homelessness. Material and methods: A secondary data analysis of patients’ records from a Berlin health center for homeless people was conducted. Data from 112 homeless patients who received care at the center between the years 2006 and 2020 were included in the explorative study. Results: Mental illness was present in 84.9% of patients before the onset of homelessness. The factors associated with an early onset of homelessness were low school education and drug abuse. A long duration of homelessness was associated with the factors alcohol abuse as well as imprisonment. Each new episode of street homelessness was associated with an average increase in the duration of homelessness by 7.9 months. Discussion: Since mental illnesses are important factors influencing the development and maintenance of homelessness, preventive strategies as well as specialized services for this vulnerable group need to be increasingly created. In particular, recurring episodes of street homelessness should be prevented as far as possible. The link between imprisonment and homelessness suggests that more intensive support is needed for reintegration after release from prison. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Bundesgesund.blatt.

Predictors of Secondary Completion Among Homeless Youth in Three U.S. Cities and the Potential Application of National Policies,"Hatch, E.; Villagrana, K.; Wu, Q.; Lawler, S.; Ferguson, K.","Purpose: Secondary education completion rates (i.e., high school diploma or General Education Development [GED]) among homeless youth (HY) are low in comparison with their housed peers. Method: Secondary data with a sample of 429 HY was used from a 3-city study using quantitative retrospective interviews with a purposive sample of601 HY collected from 2010 to 2011 in social service organizations across three U.S. cities (Denver, CO, n = 201; Los Angeles, CA, n = 200; and Austin, TX, n = 200). This study examines risk and resilience factors (i.e., demographics, childhood trauma, transience, mental health diagnosis, incarceration history, employment, and resilience) associated with the completion of secondary education among HY using logistic regression. Results: Secondary completion was positively associated with identifying as female, formal employment, a sense of equanimity, and experiences of childhood emotional abuse. In contrast, secondary completion was negatively associated with a history of incarceration as well as experiences of childhood physical neglect and emotional neglect. Discussion: Recommendations are made for strengthening educational institutions’ capacity to provide the comprehensive support services for HY to minimize risk factors and enhance protective factors. Similarly, the authors highlight how cross-sector collaboration, such as those approaches supported through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and the McKinney-Vento Homelessness Assistance Act, can be leveraged to minimize significant risk factors and promote resilience factors associated with secondary completion. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Child Adolesc.

“They peed on my shoes”: foregrounding intersectional minority stress in understanding LGBTQ youth homelessness,"Robinson, B.A.","Minority stress is a cause of health challenges for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth experiencing homelessness. However, in over-focusing on family rejection, the research on LGBTQ youth homelessness often misses how minority stress itself can shape the youth’s perceived pathways into and experiences of homelessness. A main objective of this study, then, foregrounds minority stress in understanding LGBTQ youth homelessness. To achieve this objective, the author conducted ethnographic fieldwork in central Texas and interviewed 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author shows how experiencing intersecting minority stressors, especially within families and youth-serving institutions, is part of the perceived pathways into homelessness. The author also documents how experiencing homelessness in conjunction with experiencing anti-LGBTQ perceived discrimination, violence, and other minority stressors such as racism impact the youth’s mental health challenges while living on the streets. A second objective of this study, then, shows how anti-LGBTQ discrimination intersects with other forms of prejudice and discrimination to shape the youth’s stressors and pathways into and experiences of homelessness. The author concludes that intersecting minority stressors shape perceived pathways into homelessness and compound with the socially stressful experiences of homelessness, but social support, especially LGBTQ-specific support, can help ameliorate these challenges. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2023,,J.

Predictors of service utilization among homeless former foster youth: Implications for intervention,"Yoshioka-Maxwell, A.","Summary: A high percentage of homeless youth have a history of foster care placement; this population faces high rates of behavioral health problems. No research has focused on the predictors of service use among homeless former foster youth. This analysis seeks to determine what foster care and homeless experiences are associated with service use among this population. Data were collected via convenience sample from 184 homeless former foster youth at a drop-in center in Hollywood, California. A series of logistic regressions were conducted for network engagement behaviors that may be impacted by foster care experiences. Knowledge from prior empirical results form the basis for this analysis. Findings: Number of foster care placements and age at first foster care placement, overall time spent homeless, age at first homelessness, and being kicked out of housing as a cause of homelessness were associated with decreased service use. Time spent in foster care and homeless experiences during foster care were associated with increased service use. Application: Results can be used to aid in understanding which foster care and homeless experiences aid or hinder service use. From a policy level, findings from this study can aid child welfare agencies in further understanding which foster care experiences present as risk factors after transition from care. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,J.

Improving access of young adults with experience of homelessness to primary care dental services in the UK: A realist synthesis,"Ahmadyar, M.; Rai, T.; Daly, B.; Wong, G.","Objective: To understand why, how and under what circumstances interventions lead to improved access of young adults with experience of homelessness (YAEH) to primary care dental services in the UK. Methods: We followed a realist, theory-driven methodology. It involved locating existing theories, searching for evidence, document selection, data extraction/appraisal and evidence synthesis. We searched scientific databases and grey literature sources. We used these data and relevant substantive theories to develop explanations of how, why and under what circumstances interventions lead to desired outcomes. We presented these explanations in the form of context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs). The CMOCs were incorporated in an overarching programme theory, which was iteratively developed and refined throughout the realist synthesis. Results: We used 106 scientific and 18 grey literature records to synthesize 61 CMOCs. Our revised programme theory highlights the importance of four main considerations: ‘preparing a service’, ‘producing and disseminating information’, ‘outreach activities’ and ‘facilitating interactions’. When designing dental programmes for YAEH, we recommend considering the importance of prior service planning (including resourcing of emergency dental care, training staff and incorporating safety measures), creating positive experiences, flexibility, patient-centeredness, being informative and reassuring, creating an enabling environment (including strong communication, building rapport and avoiding negative judgements), having realistic expectations and designing services that empower patients. Conclusions: Improving dental access of YAEH requires attention to multiple levels. Services can achieve positive outcomes by understanding the complexity of YAEH lives, and creating contextual circumstances that encourage their attendance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Harm reduction calls to action from young people who use drugs on the streets of Vancouver and Lisbon,"Canêdo, J.; Sedgemore, K.-O.; Ebbert, K.; Anderson, H.; Dykeman, R.; Kincaid, K.; Dias, C.; Silva, D.; Charlesworth, R.; Knight, R.; Fast, D.","Vancouver, Canada, and Lisbon, Portugal, are both celebrated for their world-leading harm reduction policies and programs and regarded as models for other cities contending with the effects of increasing levels of drug use in the context of growing urban poverty. However, we challenge the notion that internationally celebrated places like Lisbon and Vancouver are meeting the harm reduction needs of young people who use drugs (YPWUD; referring here to individuals between the ages of 14 and 29). In particular, the needs of YPWUD in the context of unstable housing, homelessness, and ongoing poverty—a context which we summarize here as “street involvement”—are not being adequately met. We are a group of community and academic researchers and activists working in Vancouver, Lisbon, and Pittsburgh. Most of us identify as YPWUD and have lived and living experience with the issues described in this comment.

LGBTQ Youth Homelessness: Why We Need to Protect Our LGBTQ Youth,"Ormiston, C.K.","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth are 120% more likely to be homeless than cisgender and heterosexual youth, yet current federal policies are insufficient and exclude LGBTQ youth. Youth homeless shelters are inadequately equipped to serve LGBTQ homeless youth due to poor funding, a focus on heterosexual or cisgender clients in their programs, and a lack of LGBTQ-friendly policies. Given the pervasiveness of this issue, public health and social policy interventions must be considered. In this perspective, the LGBTQ homeless youth epidemic is introduced and described, past policies are analyzed, and policy recommendations are made.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",2022,,LGBT Health,9,4,217-221,,10.1089/lgbt.2021.0324,,#771,Ormiston 2022,,
Independent living programs and services for youth 'aging out' of care in Canada and the U.S.: A systematic review,"Doucet, M.M.; Greeson, J.K.P.; Eldeeb, N.","Evidence from American and Canadian studies over the last three decades demonstrates that youth exiting foster care are at a much higher risk to face a multiplicity of challenges than their peers who are not in care. These challenges result in negative outcomes, such as high rates of homelessness, under-education, unemployment or under-employment, poverty, mental health issues and post-traumatic stress, substance abuse and early pregnancy or parenthood. This systematic review addresses Independent Living Program (ILP) and Independent Living Services (ILS) studies in the U.S. and Canada published between 2000 and 2018. In order to compile a list of relevant ILP and ILS impact studies, a bibliographic search of six databases was conducted for the peer-reviewed literature, and the grey literature was searched using Google and expert consultation. The search yielded a total of 64 studies after applying our study selection protocol, with 50 from the peer review literature and 14 from the grey literature. The clear majority of studies originated from the U.S., with only three Canadian studies emerging from the grey literature. This is most likely due to differences in mandated data collection and reporting. In the U.S., data collection and reporting is mandatory under the Foster Care Independence Act in 1999. In Canada, there is no such mandatory reporting as child welfare services are under the sole jurisdiction of the provinces, with no Federal government involvement aside from First Nations children and youth. Studies to date suggest that ILP and ILS are not producing the intended outcomes, with limited to no impact demonstrated on youth leaving care wellbeing outcomes. In fact, some of the studies found a negative impact, especially related to social support. Much of the ILP and ILS studies did not incorporate the voices of youth in care, but rather focused on program process and components, staff experiences, and outcome measures such as social support, employment, income, housing and self-sufficiency. Of the limited ILP and ILS studies incorporating youth perspectives, youth in care often indicated that emotional support and mentoring are crucial needs during the transition to adulthood, which are often not the focus of ILP or ILS. Moreover, compared to the U.S., program impact studies in Canada are sorely lacking; more research needs to be done in this area to build our knowledge of evidence-based and best practices. This systematic review highlights two main conclusions: (1) Both the U.S. and Canada sorely need innovation with respect to preparing youth in care for the transition to adulthood; and (2) We also must commit to using rigorous research designs with such programming to determine the impact of such new approaches. In sum, we must reconceptualize our investment in youth in care and focus on their interdependence in order to realize their potential.

"A population-based study of homelessness, antisocial behaviour and violence victimisation among young adults in Victoria, Australia","Heerde, J.A.; Bailey, J.A.; Patton, G.C.; Toumbourou, J.W.","Homeless young adults are at increased risk for contact with the police and are overrepresented in the justice system. This study explored associations between homelessness, antisocial behaviour and violence victimisation using longitudinal panel data gathered through young adulthood. Data were drawn from a state representative population-based sample of young adults from Victoria, Australia participating in the International Youth Development Study (IYDS; n = 2884, 54% female). Participants were surveyed at age 21 years, with follow-up at ages 23 and 25 years. We examined changes in the prevalence of homelessness and tested hypothesised directional relationships between young adult homelessness, antisocial behaviour and violence victimisation using longitudinal cross-lagged panel models. Multiple-group modelling was used to test whether these relationships were moderated by gender. The prevalence of young adult homelessness was highest at age 21 (6.5%), declining at ages 23 (3.9%) and 25 years (2.5%). Results showed that young adult homelessness, antisocial behaviour and victimisation were related cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Gender did not significantly moderate these associations. Findings suggest that the state of homelessness is associated with temporary vulnerability to potentially harmful and problematic situations involving antisocial behaviour and victimisation. These situations are likely to heighten risk for contact with the police and direct physical and psychological harm. © 2022 The Authors.

The Housing Pathways and Experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Youth as They Transition from out of Home Care in Victoria and Western Australia,"Jau, J.; Mendes, P.; Chavulak, J.; Martin, R.","It is well established that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people are over-represented in Australian child protection and out-of-home care systems. Despite this, there has been limited analysis of their exit from care pathways. This study, based on interviews with 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth from Victoria and Western Australia (who were a sub-set of a larger study of 34 care leavers), examined their transition experiences and outcomes in relation to accessing stable and affordable housing. While all care leavers spoke of poor or non-existent transition planning, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants were more likely to report incidences of homelessness and more complex experiences in a range of areas. Importantly, the group identified a need for culturally appropriate service models which built on and enhanced cultural and kinship connections. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,"Int.

Understanding perinatal patient’s health preferences and patient-provider relationships to prevent congenital syphilis in California and Louisiana,"Wagman, J.A.; Park, E.; Giarratano, G.P.; Buekens, P.M.; Harville, E.W.","Background: Congenital syphilis (CS) has reemerged as a global maternal and child health crisis. Kern County, California and East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana are among the highest CS morbidity regions in the United States. We previously reported on social-ecological and structural barriers to prenatal care and maternal syphilis testing and treatment in these two regions. The aim of this study was to examine perinatal patient’s health preferences and perceptions of patient-provider relationships in the prenatal care clinic setting. Methods: Between May 2018 and January 2019 we conducted 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with prenatal providers and 8 focus group discussions with pregnant and postpartum individuals in Kern County and East Baton Rouge Parish. We applied an adapted health services framework to analyze participants’ understanding of health disparities and vulnerable populations; perinatal patient’s health and prenatal care preferences; and participants’ perspectives of clinical encounters in the context of prenatal care and maternal syphilis testing and treatment. Results: Site-specific determinants of syphilis infection emerged but participants from both locations felt CS prevention efforts should be prioritized among youth, racial/ethnic minority populations, people experiencing socioeconomic limitations and people with other commonly occurring health conditions. Although perinatal patients expressed clear health preferences, they reported inconsistent receipt of respectful, patient-centered care. Inconsistencies were connected with limited ethnic and cultural competence among providers, and implicit, negative attitudes toward patients using substances, experiencing homelessness, or engaging in sex work. Providers clearly aimed to offer high quality prenatal care. However, some clinic and health systems level factors were thought to reduce positive and communicative patient-provider relationships, contributing to gaps in use of prenatal care and syphilis testing and treatment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that interventions tailored to address setting-specific determinants (including clinic and health system factors) of disparities in CS risk could improve pregnant people’s access to prenatal care and ensure they and their sex partners receive timely syphilis screening and treatment. We recommend all prenatal care providers receive training on how to identify and mitigate implicit biases and provide competent and compassionate patient-centered care. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,22,1,,,10.1186/s12884-022-04883-w,,#780,Wagman 2022,,
Watch Me Rise: An evaluation of Wraparound with homeless youth with a child welfare history,"Lindquist-Grantz, R.; Downing, K.; Hicks, M.; Houchin, C.; Ackman, V.","Older youth involved with child welfare experience disproportionate rates of homelessness after leaving custody compared to youth with no child welfare history. More intervention programs for this population are needed. Watch Me Rise (WMR) was developed as part of an initiative to build evidence for interventions that prevent homelessness among youth and young adults who have a child welfare history. WMR is based on High Fidelity Wraparound (Wraparound) and was implemented in a shelter that serves homeless youth (ages 18–24) in order to prevent them from experiencing recurring homelessness. The present study was part of a formative evaluation of youth outcomes in WMR and looks at preliminary findings within the first six months of enrollment in the program. A total of 87 youth enrolled in WMR during the evaluation period and results indicate youth housing stability improved within the first six months of youth enrolling in WMR. Youth also demonstrated improvements in life domain functioning and employment/employment readiness. Although several other outcomes were not achieved or the results were inconclusive, the study highlights important insights for working with and studying this important population. Implications for the implementation of WMR or Wraparound with homeless youth who have a child welfare history are discussed. © 2022",2022,,Child. Youth Serv.

Mental health correlates of quitting cigarette smoking in youth experiencing homelessness,"Tran, D.D.; Davis, J.P.; Atieh, T.; Pedersen, E.R.; Tucker, J.S.","Smoking prevalence among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) is three times higher than smoking prevalence among the general population. Many YEH who smoke are interested in quitting smoking, but also report smoking to cope with mental health symptoms. Research on factors that facilitate or impede successful smoking cessation among YEH is limited. This study examined mental health correlates (i.e., anxiety and depression symptoms) of quitting-related factors (i.e., quit attempts, perceived barriers to quitting) and whether smoking to cope moderates these relationships among this vulnerable population. The sample consisted of 77 YEH cigarette smokers between the ages of 18–25 who were interested in quitting. Participants completed a survey assessing various behavioral and cognitive factors related to tobacco use. Analyzing two separate models, hierarchical negative binomial and hierarchical linear regression were used to examine hypothesized correlates of the number of past year quit attempts and perceived barriers to quitting. Smoking to cope moderated the relationships of depression with past year quit attempts and perceived barriers to quitting. Those high in depression and smoking to cope had the fewest number of quit attempts and reported the greatest perceived barriers. Anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated with quit attempts or perceived barriers. Smoking cessation interventions that address using smoking to cope with mental health symptoms may be important for YEH with depression. © 2022",2022,,Addict.

Exploring Mental Health and Holistic Healing through the Life Stories of Indigenous Youth Who Have Experienced Homelessness,"Gabriel, M.D.; Mirza, S.; Stewart, S.L.","Indigenous youth are the fastest growing population in Canada, yet are marked by profound and disproportionate personal, societal, political, and colonial barriers that predispose them to mental health challenges, employment and educational barriers, and experiences of housing insecurity and homelessness. It is only from the perspectives and experiences of Indigenous community members themselves that we can gain appropriate insights into effective supports, meaningful interventions, and accessible pathways to security. This paper will explore the mental health of Indigenous youth who are at risk of, or who have experienced, homelessness, as well as the lifelong perspectives, teachings, and guidance from Indigenous Elders and traditional knowledge keepers; their perspectives are weaved throughout, in order to provide a more effective means to addressing holistic healing and the mental health needs of Indigenous homeless youth. As educators, researchers and clinicians who have sought to understand this issue in more depth, our analysis aims to raise awareness about the complexities of Indigenous youth homelessness and push back against systemic barriers that contribute to homelessness, fail young people, and subject them to oppression.

Health Care Needs of Young Adults Who Have Experienced Homelessness,"Semborski, S.; Henwood, B.; Madden, D.; Rhoades, H.","Introduction: Young adults experiencing homelessness have poorer overall health compared with the general population. However, not much is known about how health care needs may change in the transition from homelessness to supportive housing. This study utilizes the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations to examine unmet health care needs among young adults currently experiencing homelessness and formerly homeless young adults living in supportive housing. Methods: This study includes data from 192 young adults who were either residing in a supportive housing program (n=103) or were ""unhoused"" (eg, residing on the street, staying in emergency shelters; n=89) in Los Angeles, CA, between 2017 and 2019. Hierarchical modeling examined unmet health care needs and factors that may enable those needs to be met, controlling for predisposing and other need factors. Results: Controlling for predisposing and other need characteristics, this study identified increased enabling factors among those residing in supportive housing, the most widely applied intervention for homelessness. Participants who resided in supportive housing were more likely to report at least 1 type of unmet need than youth who did not have access to housing. Additional findings regarding the association of enabling factors and unmet need yield mixed results based on the type of unmet need. Discussion: The acknowledgment of unmet needs may, in fact, be a byproduct of shifting priorities, which often occurs in the transition from homelessness to housing. Understanding the unmet need and health implications of this transition has relevance for practice as we work to better support formerly homeless young adults in meeting the needs that they identify. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: This study utilized the Homeless Management Information System administrative data of 10 922 youth experiencing homelessness collected from a convenience sample of 16 geographically diverse communities across the USA between 2015-17. Using multinomial logistic regression analyses and logistic regression, main effects and interaction effects of racial/ethnic minority identity and sexual/gender minority identity were examined on various homelessness exits (n = 9957) and housing sustainability (n = 5836). Results: Black youth, relative to White youth, were disproportionately exiting homelessness through incarceration (P < 0.001). Black and Latinx youth were less likely to successfully self-resolve their homelessness (both P < 0.05). Black heterosexual and Black and Latinx non-heterosexual youth were most frequently lost to the homeless system (all P < 0.01). Black youth, relative to White youth, were approximately half as likely to remain stably housed after returning to family (P < 0.01). Conclusions: With respect to housing exits and exit stability, Black and Latinx heterosexual youth are consistently at a disadvantage.

Navigating Treatment in the Shadow of the Overdose Crisis: Perspectives of Youth Experiencing Street-Involvement Across British Columbia,"Thulien, M.; Charlesworth, R.; Anderson, H.; Dykeman, R.; Kincaid, K.; Sedgemore, K.; Knight, R.; Fast, D.","Objective:Youth experiencing street-involvement are particularly vulnerable to substance use-related harms. Since an overdose public health emergency was declared in British Columbia (BC) in 2016, there have been concerted efforts to expand youth's access to integrated mental health and substance use treatment across the province. The present study sought to explore how youth were navigating this rapidly evolving treatment landscape.Methods:Focus groups were conducted with youth experiencing street-involvement in three BC cities, followed by a summit event in Vancouver. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and coded thematically alongside observational field notes. All activities were undertaken in collaboration with a Youth Advisory Council.Results:Across BC, youth expressed desires to achieve aspects of what some called a ""normal life""following treatment, which required having ""somewhere to go next.""In the absence of desirable housing and adequate income, youth were often left with the crushing sense that, despite their efforts, treatment would not ultimately help them to ""get somewhere better.""Negative experiences in treatment settings were also shaped by the files that ""followed""youth across care settings, inappropriate information sharing between providers, and an overemphasis on pharmacotherapies (namely, opioid agonist therapies and psychotropic medications).Conclusion:Our findings point to the inability of existing services and systems to address entrenched marginalization and chronic instability. Our findings also underscore the importance of relationship-, trust-, and future-building to providing treatment and care to youth.

The experience of food insecurity during and following homelessness in high-income countries: A systematic review and meta-aggregation,"Easton, C.; Oudshoorn, A.; Smith-Carrier, T.; Forchuk, C.; Marshall, C.A.","Homelessness is a pervasive challenge caused by poverty which continues to grow in economically developed countries, posing significant health impacts (Fazel et al., Lancet, 384: 1529–1540, 2014). While food security related to poverty and low income has been investigated, this review specifically explores the experience of food security during and following homelessness. Given the fact that the health of individuals who experience homelessness is known to be poor and the importance of nutrition, this is a necessary contribution. Informed by a health equity lens, this review synthesises the findings and quality of the literature regarding experiences of food security during and following homelessness in high-income countries. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Qualitative studies published to date were obtained from six databases. We conducted a meta-aggregation of existing qualitative findings. Twenty-four studies on 462 participants were included in the review. Through meta-aggregation four themes were created: (1) imposed food options as a determinant of health out of my control; (2) obtaining food for survival despite stigma or other consequences; (3) situated within a system that maintains food insecurity; and (4) surviving hardships. Persons during and following homelessness in high-income countries face multiple challenges when securing food while situated in an oppressive system that lacks choice. Despite this, persons who have experienced homelessness demonstrate resilience by finding ways to meet their basic needs in the face of imposed barriers.

"Counter-Narratives of Structural Oppressions, Stigma and Resistance, and Reproductive and Sexual Health Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness","Henriques, E.; Schmidt, C.; Pascoe, R.; Liss, K.; Begun, S.","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face myriad injustices regarding their reproductive and sexual health and rights. Reproductive and sexual health research with YEH often explores condom-use and sexually transmitted infections, potentially contributing to narrow conceptualizations of YEH as “unclean” or in need of disease-screening. A narrative theory perspective was applied to this study, which allowed for the emergence of alternative storylines, or counter-narratives, which attend to manifestations of power and oppression within the lives of marginalized individuals. Qualitative interviews engaged 30 young people (ages 18–21) accessing shelter services. Narrative analyses identified YEHs’ documentations of dominant narratives related to structural oppressions, stigma, and numerous dimensions of reproductive and sexual health including how they create, through their resistance, counter-narratives that include their preferred futures. YEH emphasized systemic sources of stigma and outlined their criticisms of the state. Within-group stigma emerged as a noteworthy theme, with YEH showing both empathy and ambivalence towards other YEH, along with internalization of stigmatizing narratives about pregnancy and homelessness. Approaches to service provision that further amplify youths’ voices in naming and challenging the many oppressions and stigmas they face should be prioritized. Moreover, policies should be implemented to dismantle the actual root causes of challenges faced by YEH, rather than perpetuating them through measures rooted in interlocking oppressions of discrimination, inequity, and judgment. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,Qual.

Heterosexist and cisgenderist rejection from their families frequently causes and exacerbates this housing instability. Despite these challenges, LGBTQ young adults demonstrate tremendous resilience. Using grounded theory to analyze interviews with 15 young adults experiencing family rejection and housing instability, this study seeks to illuminate the practices and attitudes that allow LGBTQ young adults to develop and maintain resilience. Analysis of the interview data revealed three main themes: (1) strategizing: taking agency, making plans, and learning lessons; (2) connecting: getting support from individuals, institutions, and communities, and engaging in their own altruism; and, (3) coping: focusing on goals, maintaining motivation, and using creativity.

"Housing after care: understanding security and stability in the transition out of care through the lenses of liminality, recognition and precarity","Glynn, N.; Mayock, P.","There is a well-documented association between histories of state care and housing instability. This paper examines care leavers’ experience of securing housing during the transition out of care through the lenses of liminality, Recognition theory, and precarity. Conducted in Ireland, sixteen care-experienced youth were recruited to a qualitative longitudinal study. The findings demonstrate how aftercare policies and a lack of affordable housing combined to create precarity for many, which also had implications for their feelings of recognition as young people. For those who remained in their foster care placements or transitioned to supported lodgings, housing stability engendered feelings of being cared for by creating a liminal space where growth was supported. Those, on the other hand, who left their foster care placements at the age of 18 or were forced to leave time-limited aftercare housing were pushed into precariousness, placing them at high risk for homelessness and housing exclusion. These young people felt misrecognised and disrespected by the state and the aftercare system. The findings highlight the deleterious consequences of time-limited aftercare supports for care leavers’ sense of security and their ability to achieve valued life goals. The implications of the study's findings for leaving care and aftercare policies are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,J.

Prevalence and Correlates of Illicit Substance Use Among Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness in Seven Cities Across the United States,"Chassman, S.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Hsu, H.-T.; Ferguson, K.M.; Narendorf, S.C.; Maria, D.S.; Shelton, J.; Petering, R.; Bender, K.","Background: Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) engage in substantially higher substance use rates than housed young adults. This current study builds on previous research by investigating the prevalence of and salient correlates of illicit substance use across a seven-city sample. Methods: This study used the Homeless Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (HYRRS) dataset, n=1426 Young adults experiencing homelessness to study patterns and correlates of illicit substance use. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess correlates of substance use. Study site, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, history of suicidal ideation, use of specific substances, and trading sex for drugs were associated with five types of illicit substance use (ecstasy, cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, and injection drug use). Conclusion: Findings indicate that substance use interventions for YAEH must be multifaceted, addressing illicit and multiple substance use, along with the myriad factors associated with substance use among this at-risk group. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,J.

"Lonely, harassed and abandoned in society: the lived experiences of Iranian homeless youth","Johari, F.; Iranpour, A.; Dehghan, M.; Alizadeh, S.; Safizadeh, M.; Sharifi, H.","Introduction: Homelessness is increasing among young adults in large cities. According to the United Nations, there are more than one billion absolute or relative homeless people in the world. This study was conducted to explain the lived experiences of homeless youth in southeastern Iran. Materials and methods: In this qualitative study, we recruited 13 participants in a big city, southeast Iran, in 2020. The participant was young homeless adults aged 18–29 years who were using homeless shelters provided by the municipality, sleeping in parks or on streets. Data were collected through in-depth and semi-structured interviews and three focus group discussions. Data were analyzed by conventional qualitative content analysis. Results: The main category of “lonely, annoyed, and abandoned in society” and three subcategories of avoidance of/by society, comprehensive harassment, and lack of comprehensive support were extracted. The experiences of young homeless adults showed that they escaped from the community due to addiction, feeling like a burden to others, and social isolation, and not only have they been left without support in society, but they have also suffered from all kinds of physical and psychological harassments. Conclusion: The lived experiences of homeless people show that in addition to appropriate facilities and living conditions, they require respect, reduced social stigma, discrimination, and favorable conditions for a return to life. Therefore, authorities should identify and settle their problems and needs. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Psychol.,10,1,,,10.1186/s40359-022-00787-8,,#821,Johari 2022,,
Telemedicine in the treatment of addictions,"Caballeria, E.; López-Pelayo, H.; Matrai, S.; Gual, A.","Purpose of reviewThe purpose of this update is to provide an overview of recent research publications (January 2020-January 2022) on real-time telemedicine solutions for the management of addictions (alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and other drugs).Recent findingsMotivational interviewing by real-time telemedicine showed effectiveness in youth and adults for risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorders, even when a concurrent mental health disorder exists. Live telemedicine is well accepted for managing tobacco use disorders. The range of interventions for treating opioid use disorder by real-time telemedicine is large and has been increased due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (prescription of opioid agonists, peer-to-peer support, counseling, and group therapy).SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation of real-time telemedicine and, in parallel, research has been conducted to test its effectiveness. Videoconferencing and telephone interventions are supported by solid evidence for risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder. The Integration of other types of telemedicine (asynchronous telemedicine and remote monitoring) and with the entire health system is lacking. Many areas and vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, elderly, and cannabis use disorders) need more attention. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",2022,,Curr. Opin.

Psychosocial factors influencing smoking relapse among youth experiencing homelessness: A qualitative study,"Patterson, J.G.; MacIsco, J.M.; Glasser, A.M.; Wermert, A.; Nemeth, J.M.","Objectives In the United States, up to 70% of youth experiencing homelessness smoke cigarettes. Many are interested in quitting; however, little is known about psychosocial factors influencing smoking relapse in this population. This study, part of a larger project to develop an optimized smoking cessation intervention for youth experiencing homelessness, aimed to describe how psychosocial factors influence smoking relapse in this group. Methods This study describes the smoking relapse experiences of 26 youth tobacco users, aged 14- 24 years, who were recruited from a homeless drop-in center in Ohio. We conducted semistructured interviews to understand how stress, opportunity, and coping contribute to smoking relapse. Results Five themes emerged from the data: (1) smoking as a lapse in emotional self-regulation in response to stress; (2) smoking as active emotional self-regulation in response to stress; (3) social opportunities facilitate smoking in the context of emotion-focused stress coping; (4) problem-focused stress coping; and (5) opportunity facilitates smoking relapse. Conclusions Stress was a primary driver of smoking relapse among youth experiencing homelessness, yet social and environmental opportunities to smoke also precipitated relapse. Interventions to improve abstinence among this population should target foundational stressors, coping skills, social supports, and nicotine dependence. Copyright:  © 2022 Patterson et al.

"The Relationship Between Self-Compassion, Childhood Maltreatment and Attachment Orientation In High-Risk Adolescents","Quinlan, H.M.; Hadden, K.L.; Storey, D.P.","The purpose of the current study was to explore whether selfcompassion predicted psychological distress over and above childhood maltreatment and attachment orientation in high-risk youths. Fifty-one youths (31 males, 20 females) aged 17 to 24, recruited from a community non-profit organization in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, were administered validated measures of childhood maltreatment, attachment orientation, self-compassion, and psychological distress. Results indicated that self-compassion was inversely associated with childhood maltreatment, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and psychological distress. However, results did not support the hypothesis that self-compassion was a significant predictor of psychological distress over and above attachment anxiety and childhood maltreatment in high-risk youths. Our results indicated that self-compassion is not well developed in street-involved youths and may be a vital intervention target to heal negative internalized views of the self, while maintaining vigilance to threats inherent in the street environment. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,,Youth Soc.,54,5,890-906,,10.1177/0044118X211002857,,#833,Quinlan 2022,,
Use of technology to provide mental health services to youth experiencing homelessness: a scoping review protocol,"Lal, S.; Elias, S.; Sieu, V.; Peredo, R.","Introduction Despite the importance to address mental health issues as early as possible, youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) often lack prompt and easy access to health services. Recently, there has been a surge of studies focusing on leveraging technology to improve access to mental health services for YEH; however, limited efforts have been made to synthesise this literature, which can have important implications for the planning of mental health service delivery. Thus, this scoping review aims to map and synthesise research on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide mental health services and interventions to YEH. Methods and analysis A scoping review of the literature will be conducted, following Arksey and O'Malley's proposed methodology, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews and recent guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. All peer-reviewed papers using ICTs as a means of intervention will be considered, as well as grey literature. Only documents in English or French will be included in the analysis. First, 10 electronic databases will be consulted. Next, all data will be extracted into Covidence. Then, two reviewers will independently conduct the screening and data extraction process, in the case of discrepancies, a third reviewer will be included. Finally, data will be synthesised according to our objectives. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required, as data will be collected from published literature. Findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journals. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

Assessing the fidelity of delivery style of a mental skills training programme for young people experiencing homelessness,"Tidmarsh, G.; Whiting, R.; Thompson, J.L.; Cumming, J.","There is a need for positive youth development/strengths-based approaches to support the wellbeing and social inclusion of young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) uses a strengths-based approach with the aim to improve young people's resilience, self-worth, wellbeing and engagement in education, employment, and training. This mixed methods study assessed the fidelity of delivery style of the MST4Life™ programme, the extent to which frontline service staff can delivery psychologically informed programmes to service users and identified barriers and enablers to delivering with fidelity to the intended style. Observations of programme delivery (two facilitators per session) took place across early, middle, and late phases of the programme across a pilot phase (n = 18) and main study (n = 45). Facilitators also completed self-reflection forms following each session. The mean observation score was 82.2 ± 15.7 %, and facilitator self-report mean adherence score was 89.3 ± 6.2 % which indicate that the programme was delivered with high fidelity. Quantitative data was also analysed using non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U Test). There was a significant difference between observation scores for deliverers with postgraduate psychology training compared to deliverers without postgraduate psychology training (p =.029). Qualitative data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Barriers and enablers included communication, frontline staff support, logistics, and participant behaviours. Overall, this study highlights that despite the challenges of delivering complex community programmes to young people experiencing homelessness, it was possible for frontline service staff to deliver MST4Life™ with high fidelity. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Eval.

Post-housing first outcomes amongst a cohort of formerly homeless youth in Aotearoa New Zealand,"Fraser, B.; Chun, S.; Pehi, T.; Jiang, T.; Johnson, E.; Ombler, J.; McMinn, C.; Pierse, N.","This paper explores the government service interactions for a cohort of formerly homeless youth in Aotearoa New Zealand, using linked administrative data. We report the rates of service interactions pre- and post-housing for a cohort of 69 youth, aged 18–25 years old, who received housing and support from a Housing First provider. 60.9% were women, and 69.6% were Māori. Very high rates of service interactions were seen both before and after they were housed. The evidence shows promising potential improvements in young people’s lives when housed. The most significant changes we saw in the one and two years post-housing were in incomes from both wages/salaries and social welfare benefits; there was a significant increase in total income for our cohort. There was also a promising reduction in hospitalisations and emergency deparment admissions. Overall, Housing First shows promising outcomes for youth. © 2022 The Author(s).

Effect of Portable Rent Subsidies and Mentorship on Socioeconomic Inclusion for Young People Exiting Homelessness: A Community-Based Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial,"Thulien, N.S.; Amiri, A.; Hwang, S.W.; Kozloff, N.; Wang, A.; Akdikmen, A.; Roglich, J.; Nisenbaum, R.","Importance: There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness. Objective: To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022. Interventions: Participants (n = 24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (n = 13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem - proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Results: A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -5.0 to 1.0; P =.18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.3; P =.44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; P =.03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes - potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies - are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation.

An updated examination of the predictors of running away from foster care in the United States and trends over ten years (2010–2019),"Branscum, C.; Richards, T.N.","Background: Among the more than 400,000 children in foster care, there is a small group who will run away from care and face increased risks of negative outcomes. Previous studies on the predictors of running away from care use limited samples or outdated data. Objective: The present study replicates and extends prior research by presenting an updated analysis of predictors of running away from foster care as well as 10-year trends in the prevalence and predictors of running from care. Participants and setting: This study uses the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data to assess the runaway status of 597,911 children who were involved in foster care in 2019. Longitudinal trend analyses utilize AFCARS data from 2010 to 2019. Method: Using chi-square/t-tests and binary logistic regression analyses, this study investigates individual- and case-level predictors of running away from foster care programs. Results: Findings show that girls (OR = 1.29, p < .001), African American children (OR = 1.89, p < .001), and older children (OR = 1.61, p < .001) are at increased risk of running away from foster care. Removal reasons such as child substance abuse (OR = 1.65, p < .001), abandonment (OR = 1.38, p < .001), and child behavioral problems (OR = 1.31, p < .001) are also associated with an increased risk. Analysis of 10-year trends shows a steady decline in running from care: 1.40% in 2010 to 0.98% in 2019. The profile of risk factors is stable overall, with a few notable exceptions. Conclusions: The percent of children running from foster care is at a 10-year low. Prevention and intervention efforts regarding running from care must focus on the needs of African American and Hispanic children, especially girls, as well as children with substance use or behavior problems. Given that programs rarely have prospective information regarding why children leave care and the negative consequences of labeling children as “runaways,” shifting language to “missing from care” should be considered. © 2022",2022,,Child Abuse Negl.,129,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105689,,#848,Branscum 2022,,
Do Independent Living Services Protect Youth Aging Out Foster Care From Adverse Outcomes? An Evaluation Using National Data,"Huang, H.; Li, Y.; Campbell, J.M.","Objective: Youth aging out foster care are at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Federal funded programs have provided independent living services (ILSs) to these youth. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the continuity of ILSs at ages 17–19 in protecting youth aging out foster care from homelessness and incarceration at ages 19–21. Method: This study used data on 4,853 foster youth from the National Youth in Transition Database and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System. Logistic regression was used to regress two binary outcomes on seven ILS variables and covariates. Results: The results suggest that remaining in foster care, continuous receipts of academic support, and financial assistance services at ages 17–19 protected foster youth from experiencing homelessness. Remaining in foster care and continuous receipt of financial assistance services at ages 17–19 protected foster youth from incarceration at ages 19–21. But, surprisingly, continuous receipt of housing education and home management training, and health education and risk prevention training at ages 17–19 were each associated with increased risk of homelessness at ages 19–21. The results also showed statistically significant effects of several covariates.

However, to date to there is limited research exploring housing first interventions with youth experiencing homelessness. Homeless youth are a distinctly different population than homeless adults, thus housing first interventions will need to consider the unique needs of homeless youth. To better understand how homeless youth may respond to a housing first intervention, the current study utilized qualitative interviews with 17 youth who had recently participated in a 6-month housing first intervention. Overall, youth reported generally positive experiences and believed the intervention had led to improvements in their lives.

Methods: DESIGN: A Solomon four-group (double randomized controlled trial) longitudinal design with repeated measures (3- and 6-month follow-ups) was used in drop-in centers for YEH in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio from which 602 youths, 18-24 years-old (M = 21 ± 1.8), 50% white; 69.9% heterosexual were recruited. A manualized one-on-one intervention consisted of six modules delivered via laptop computers. Modules focused on communication, goal-setting, substance use refusal, safe sex behaviors, enhanced psychological capital (hope, optimism, resilience, self-efficacy, gratitude), and life satisfaction. Valid and reliable measures of hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, social connectedness, gratitude, condom intention, self-efficacy for safe sex, safe sex behaviors, self-efficacy for substance use refusal, and life satisfaction were used to collect data for which three hypotheses were tested, using intent to treat, with multi-level modeling (R). Results: The analysis showed partial support for all hypotheses: (1) post-test outcomes were greater than pretests; (2) intervention group outcomes were greater than control group measures; and (3) significant effects for pretesting. YEH in Ohio completed significantly more sessions than YEH in Texas (p = .001), but took significantly longer to complete all six sessions (p = .001). Discussion: This brief intervention had significant effects on YEH to promote healthy attitudes and behaviors that merit further testing in larger samples. © 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2022,,J.

"Characterizing tobacco and marijuana use among youth combustible tobacco users experiencing homelessness – considering product type, brand, flavor, frequency, and higher-risk use patterns and predictors","Glasser, A.M.; Hinton, A.; Wermert, A.; Macisco, J.; Nemeth, J.M.","Background: Cigarette smoking is three times more prevalent among youth experiencing homelessness compared with the general population. Co-use of tobacco and marijuana is also common. The aim of this study is to characterize tobacco and marijuana use among youth experiencing homelessness who use combustible tobacco in a Midwestern city to inform smoking cessation intervention. Methods: This study included 96 youth (ages 14–24 years; 52% male, 39% female, 5% transgender/non-binary) attending a homeless drop-in center who had used at least one combustible tobacco product in the past week. We assessed past-month use of tobacco products and marijuana, other product use characteristics (e.g., frequency, brand and flavor), and psychosocial predictors of more frequent (i.e., daily) use of combustible tobacco and marijuana. Results: Most youth experiencing homelessness with past-week combustible tobacco use had used cigarettes (n = 85, 88.5%), cigars (n = 89, 92.7%), and marijuana (n = 82, 85.4%) in the past month. One-third (n = 34) used electronic vapor products (EVPs), 19.8% (n = 19) smoked hookah, and 11.5% (n = 11) used smokeless tobacco (ST). Most marijuana users co-administered with tobacco (n = 67, 69.8%). Daily combustible tobacco smoking was associated with having a child and smoking out of boredom/habit. Daily marijuana use was associated with using substances to cope with one’s housing situation. Newport (n = 66, 72.5%) and Black & Mild (n = 48, 51.1%) were the most popular brands of cigarettes and cigars among ever users. Most non-combustible tobacco ever users reported not having a usual brand (EVPs: n = 51, 73.9%; ST: n = 16, 57.1%). Cigar smokers reported the most varied selection of flavors. Conclusions: Young combustible tobacco users experiencing homelessness engage in high-risk use patterns, including poly-tobacco use, co-use of tobacco with marijuana, and frequent combustible product use.

"A Benefit-Cost Analysis of BackTrack, a Multi-Component, Community-Based Intervention for High-Risk Young People in a Rural Australian Setting","Deeming, S.; Edmunds, K.; Knight, A.; Searles, A.; Shakeshaft, A.P.; Doran, C.M.","BackTrack is a multi-component, community-based program designed to build capacity amongst high-risk young people. The aim of this study was to conduct a benefit-cost analysis of BackTrack, which was implemented in Armidale, a rural town in New South Wales, Australia. Costs and benefits were identified, measured and valued in 2016 Australian dollars. Costs were estimated from program financial and administrative records. Benefits were estimated using a pre-post design and conservative economic assumptions. Benefits included education attendance or completion; employment; engagement with health service providers; reduced homelessness; economic productivity; reduced vandalism to local infrastructure; reduced youth crime; reduced engagement with the justice system; and program income generated by participants. The counterfactual baseline was zero educational outcome, based on discussions with BackTrack staff and expert informants. We tested this assumption compared to the assumption that participants had a Year 8 education. There was evidence of significant quantifiable improvements in several outcomes: high school attendance or completion, vocational education attendance or completion, unskilled or vocationally qualified employment and economic productivity. Reduced homelessness, engagement with health services and acquisition of job readiness skills, as well as reduced local infrastructure vandalism and reduced crime were further quantifiable improvements. The net social benefit of BackTrack was estimated at $3,267,967 with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.03, meaning that every dollar invested in BackTrack would return $2.03 in benefits.

Health System Access for Precariously Housed Youth: A Participatory Youth Research Project,"Nichols, N.; Malenfant, J.","This article builds from young people’s experiences navigating health system organizations to identify concrete institutional and policy processes that pose problems for youth experiencing or at risk of homelessness, as well as those that show promise in terms of health promotion. Our participatory youth research team explored homeless youth’s health-seeking practices, the specific barriers they face, and relations between their health-seeking efforts and their homelessness. Youth and adult co-researchers interviewed 38 individual youth (aged 16–29) who completed 64 qualitative institutional history interviews. Their accounts illuminate a systemic lack of capacity to address the mental health needs of homeless youth. Unable to secure access to timely, sufficient, and suitable programs and services, youth navigate patchwork of crisis and emergency supports that undermine their autonomy, their health, and their housing stability. Finally, youth without stable housing—particularly those who are Trans* and non-binary youth and/or who use drugs—report discrimination in health care settings.

Youth perceptions and concerns about sexually transmissible infections versus pregnancy: A qualitative comparative study in California,"Decker, M.J.; Borgen, N.; Gutmann-Gonzalez, A.; Brindis, C.D.","Background: Although rates of adolescent pregnancy have been declining for decades, rates of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) continue to increase among youth. Little is known about youth's comparative concern regarding pregnancy and STIs, particularly among marginalised populations. Therefore, this study compares concerns toward unplanned pregnancy and STIs and identifies underlying reasons for these differing concerns in youth populations with elevated rates of STIs. Methods: Fourteen focus groups were held with 92 youth in two counties in California, USA. Youth were purposefully selected from community-based organisations and schools to represent a variety of backgrounds and populations with elevated rates of pregnancy and STIs. Qualitative coding and analysis were conducted using ATLAS.ti. 7.0. Results: Almost all participants were youth of colour (86%), 27% identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, and 21% had ever experienced homelessness. Although most youth were generally concerned about the consequences of contracting an STI, including the possible stigma associated with it, both males and females were more worried about an unplanned pregnancy. Emergent themes included varying concerns about the lasting consequences of unplanned pregnancies and STIs; greater visibility of pregnancy compared to infection; stigma; and limited STI prevention efforts compared to teen pregnancy prevention. Conclusions: By addressing the underlying concerns and varying perceptions that different groups of youth have toward STIs and pregnancy, prevention approaches and messages can be tailored, including by age, gender, sexual orientation, and for those exposed to vulnerable living situations. Additional efforts are needed to address increasing rates of STIs among young people.  © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Published by CSIRO Publishing.",2022,,Sex.

"Pregnancy and sexual related problems among women living on the street in dire Dawa City, Eastern Ethiopia, 2021: qualitative study","Assegid, D.T.; Abera, L.; Girma, M.; Hailu, M.; Tefera, B.","Background: The problem of women and youths living on the street is a global phenomenon. It has created countless problems while they lived on the street; such as unwanted pregnancies, sexual exploitation and prostitution. It is a frequent observation to see women begging on the streets of major cities in Ethiopia having one or two babies by their sides. This study will give an in-depth understanding of the distressing and highly challenging problem among women on the street regarding pregnancy and related problems. Objective: To explore pregnancy and sexual-related problems among women living on the street in Dire Dawa city, Eastern Ethiopia 2021. Methods: A community-based phenomenological qualitative study was conducted at Dire Dawa city. Data was collected from homeless women and Key informants through focus group discussion and in-depth interviews using a semi-structured tool aided by a voice recorder. Data were analyzed thematically using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti7. The thematic analysis with inductive approach goes through 6 steps; Familiarization, Coding, Generating themes, Reviewing themes, Defining and naming themes and Writing up. Result: Women living on the street are more likely to experience physical abuse, sexual harassment, Sexual transmitted infection, unprotected sex and unwanted pregnancy. As a result, the fate of this pregnancy is abortion leads to high risk of getting health complications as most abortions are made in illegal and unsafe ways. Conclusion: Teen pregnancy, STI, rape and unsafe abortion are the major concerns as it accompanied by their homelessness situation and abusive lifestyles. The regional health bureau needs to understand the extent of problem and plan to organize an awareness creation program on STI, risk of pregnancy and SRH services. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Women's Health,22,1,,,10.1186/s12905-022-02006-3,,#878,Assegid 2022,,
Lifetime alcohol-use prevalence and correlated factors among street children in Iran,"Roshanfekr, P.; Ali, D.; Noroozi, M.; Bahrami, G.; Vameghi, M.","Background: Several studies on street children in Iran reported a high prevalence of alcohol consumption among this group. This study assessed the prevalence of lifetime alcohol use and correlated factors among street children in Iran. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 856 street children from six provinces of Iran. Behavioral data were collected by trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire. Our target outcome was lifetime alcohol use. We examined associations between individual variables and lifetime alcohol use using the chi-square. A multiple logistic regression model included variables with a p-value <.2. Lastly, we reported the adjusted odds ratio (an OR) point estimate and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) as the effect measure. Results: Mean age and standard deviation (SD) of alcohol drinkers were 14.94 ± 2.16. Overall, 16.6% (CI95%: 14.38%, 19.55%) of participants reported lifetime alcohol use, and almost 60% of children reported alcohol use over three past months. In the final model, factors that were independently associated with alcohol use included the 15–18 age range (AOR 2.35, 95% CI 1.48−3.73), Iranian nationality (AOR 3.36, 95% CI 2.07−5.45), working longer than 5 years in the streets (AOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.72−4.88), father's drug use (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.22−3.01), and illiteracy (AOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03−2.66). Conclusions: The results of the present study demonstrated that preventive plans for alcohol use among street children must be addressed using the services provided by governmental and nongovernmental organizations. © 2022 The Authors.

Street Children in Ghana’s Golden Triangle Cities: Mental Health Needs and Associated Risks,"Dankyi, E.; Huang, K.-Y.","More than 61,000 persons below the age of 18 are living on the streets in the Greater Accra region in Ghana. Street children is a hidden vulnerable population and a global public health issue in the world, but little is known about their mental health and health needs, and mechanisms that contribute to their poor health. With a lack of mental health research to guide intervention or psychoeducation programme and policy planning, this study aimed to address these research gaps by examining prevalence of mental health problems and a set of associated risk factors (i.e. Perceived quality of life, and social connection). In addition, we examined whether the associations between risk factors and mental health problems were moderated by demographic and contextual factors (i.e., gender, age, work status, reason for living on street, number of years in street). Two hundred and seven children between age 12 and 18 who lived on the street in three cities (Accra, Sekondi Takoradi, and Kumasi) were recruited. Data were gathered through adolescent survey/interviews. Multiple regression was utilized to examine risk factors and moderation effects. Results support high mental health needs among street children. Approximately 73% street children experienced moderate to severe mental health problems, and 90% experienced poor quality of life. Perceived quality/happiness of life was the strongest predictor for street children’s mental health. Social connection was associated with children’s mental health only in certain subgroups and contexts. This study adds new epidemiological evidence for street children, an extremely vulnerable population, in Ghana and global child and adolescent mental health. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Child Psychiatry Hum.

"Systematic review: Rates of psychopathology, substance misuse, and neuropsychological dysfunction among transitional age youth experiencing homelessness","Burke, C.W.; Firmin, E.S.; Wilens, T.E.","Background and Objectives: Transitional age youth experiencing homelessness (TAY-EH) bear a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality related to psychopathology, substance use disorders (SUD), and neuropsychological dysfunction. Prior reviews examining these conditions are now nearly a decade old, have focused on younger adolescent populations, or have utilized nonsystematic approaches. To our knowledge, no prior reviews have reported on all three of these domains in an integrated fashion. Here, we provide a contemporary, critical synthesis of the literature on the functioning of TAY-EH in North America within these three domains. Methods: Based upon PRISMA guidelines, a search of PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo databases was conducted, including literature published between January 2015 and June 2021. Results: The initial search yielded 2024 citations; 104 underwent full text review and 32 met inclusion criteria, with a final aggregate sample size of 13,516. Studies revealed elevated rates of mood disorders, PTSD, anxiety disorders, and alcohol misuse. There is insufficient data to draw generalizable conclusions regarding neuropsychological functioning, other SUD, or other psychiatric diagnoses. No studies reported on co-occurrence of disorders among or between the domains of psychopathology, SUD, and neuropsychological dysfunction. Four studies used structured interviews for diagnoses, with the remainder relying upon brief screeners or self-report measures. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to provide integrated findings on psychopathology, SUD, and neuropsychological dysfunction among TAY-EH. Further research using structured, DSM-based tools is needed to characterize rates of single and co-occurring conditions to inform tailored treatment interventions. © 2022 American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry.",2022,,Am.

"Perspectives of Stakeholders Working to End the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in Atlanta, Georgia","Ducak, D.; Narasimhan, S.; Ripkey, C.E.; Evans, D.P.","Accurate data on the background, risk factors, and prevalence of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) in the United States are rare and difficult to collect due to their complex, underground nature. Black and Brown youth, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth, youth with previous experiences of child and sexual abuse, youth in the foster care system, and those who have run away and/or are experiencing homelessness are disproportionately affected by CSEC, thus warranting special attention. Prevention and response strategies for CSEC often do not keep these marginalized populations in mind or include survivors in the development and implementation of strategies. This study explores the CSEC prevention and response landscape in Atlanta, Georgia. Data were collected from 12 key informants through Zoom and in-depth, telephone interviews. Interviews were held with key stakeholders working in the field of CSEC through the legal system, state employees, and anti-trafficking organizations. Emergent themes were developed by using inductive coding. Themes included: (1) the perceived risk profile of at-risk youth is changing; (2) stereotypes and stigma are barriers to appropriate and comprehensive CSEC response; (3) youth with higher risk factors are in need of greater support; (4) initiatives must be survivor-led and community based; and (5) systemic factors must be addressed to prevent CSEC. Participants observed demographic changes across individuals identifying as sexually exploited, and/or those seeking stakeholders' services. Youth often experience stigma due to their racial and socio-economic identities; due to systemic racism, Black and Brown youth are often treated as adults and not as victims. Stakeholders perceived gaps in services and support for pregnant youth, youth identified as potential recruiters for commercial sexual exploitation, youth identifying as LGBTQ, and those with substance abuse problems and mental health disorders. All participants described the need to create and fund community-based programs that focus on basic needs such as shelter, and sustainable life-enrichment programs. This study underscores the need for research focused on specific populations at risk of CSEC and the need to resolve systemic issues disproportionately affecting youth vulnerable to and experiencing CSEC.  © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",2022,,Violence Gend.,9,2,73-79,,10.1089/vio.2021.0048,,#891,Ducak 2022,,
Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Questioning/Queer Two-Spirit Adolescents and Suicidality,"Tobin, V.; Sheth, N.K.; Thompson, H.M.; Karnik, N.S.","Background: At a time when suicides are increasing throughout the United States, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and two-spirit (LGBTQ2S) adolescents are at especially high risk for suicidal ideation, attempts, and completed suicide. Objectives: This study aimed to 1) provide an overview and clinical perspective on LGBTQ2S suicidal ideation, attempts, and completed suicide, 2) discuss how the literature maps on to theories of suicide and also point the way to clinical recommendations, and 3) give recommendations for clinical care based on this evidence. Methods: This article uses a narrative review style to discuss the current concerns regarding LGBTQ2S adolescent suicide. The Social Ecological Model, the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide, and Minority Stress Theory are used to describe the manner in which risks are acquired. Results: Emerging research demonstrates risks and protective factors in the lives of LGBTQ2S adolescents. The social context of LGBTQ2S adolescents puts them at risk for internalizing the experiences of discrimination evident in our society. In addition, there are other risk factors frequently associated with their LGBTQ2S status, such as substance misuse, homelessness, and lack of social support. Adolescents of color are especially vulnerable as they experience multiple marginalizations, often living in under-resourced communities with poor access to health care. Support to families can be provided in the form of psychoeducation based on research findings. Social support is crucial and can be effectively provided in schools. Access to mental health care needs to be increased, and barriers must be reduced. Conclusion: There is a need for more research, especially prospective study designs and research that centers on adolescents of color and homeless adolescents. While there may be barriers to addressing the current rate of suicidality in this population, clinicians who work with adolescents can use a range of therapies to support their LGBTQ2S adolescent patients and their families, decreasing the risk of suicidality. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.",2022,,Adolesc.

Examining sources of Social Support and Depression Prevention Among Pregnant Youth Experiencing Homelessness: Outcomes of a Seven-City Study,"Canfield, S.M.; Hsu, H.-T.; Begun, S.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Shelton, J.; Ferguson, K.M.; Maria, D.S.; Narendorf, S.C.","Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) with pregnancy history are at higher depression risk. Receiving social support is protective for depression in pregnancy. This study differentiates social support sources associated with depression by pregnancy history among YAEH. Using a subsample of data collected from YAEH in seven US cities that were collected through REALYST, we conducted stratified logistic regression models (by pregnancy history) to identify support sources associated with depression. Logistic regression analysis including the interaction term (i.e., pregnancy history x support sources) using the full sample was then conducted. A higher proportion with pregnancy history reported depression compared to those without. Support from home-based peers was significantly associated with reduced depression risks among YAEH with pregnancy history, but not among youth without. Home-based supports were less frequently indicated by homeless female youth with pregnancy experience. Home-based social support is protective against major depression for YAEH with pregnancy experience. Findings of this study suggest that interventions addressing depression among YAEH should take their pregnancy history and social support sources into consideration. Specifically, for YAEH with pregnancy history, facilitating supportive social ties with home-based peers may be promising in reducing their depression risks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,J.

Shelter Bans Among People Experiencing Homelessness: an Exploratory Study of Predictors in Two Large Canadian Datasets,"Kerman, N.; Wang, R.; Aubry, T.; Distasio, J.; Gaetz, S.; Hwang, S.W.; Latimer, E.; O’Grady, B.; Schwan, K.; Somers, J.M.; Stergiopoulos, V.; Kidd, S.A.","Emergency shelters are a core component of homeless service systems that address immediate basic needs. Service bans, which refer to temporary or permanent disallowances from a program or organization, are an underresearched phenomenon that can leave people experiencing homelessness without needed supports. This exploratory study examined the factors associated with shelter bans among people experiencing homelessness using secondary data from two Canadian studies: (1) a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (At Home/Chez Soi Demonstration Project) and (2) a cross-sectional survey of youth experiencing homelessness across Canada (2019 Without a Home–National Youth Homelessness Survey). The two datasets were analyzed separately using logistic regression models with similar predictors to maximize the comparability of the results. Participants who experienced homelessness at an earlier age and had recent criminal justice system involvement were more likely to have shelter bans in both datasets. Impaired impulse control, more chronic medical conditions and living in Toronto were associated with increased likelihood of shelter bans in the At Home/Chez Soi dataset, whereas more adverse childhood experiences, physical violence victimization, engagement in survival sex behaviours and longer current episodes of homelessness were significant predictors of bans in the Without A Home dataset. Overall, the findings suggest that victimization and criminalization during homelessness may increase the risk of shelter loss from bans and further exclusion. The observed regional differences also highlight the potential limits of individual-level predictors. Further research is needed on shelter ban outcomes, as well as how capacity limits and organizational policies affect banning decisions. © 2022, The New York Academy of Medicine.",2022,,Urban Health,99,5,842-854,,10.1007/s11524-022-00680-0,,#898,Kerman 2022,,

We tested for differences in sexual behaviors and STI/HIV testing based on student homelessness and intersecting factors using data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey administered in 7 states and 3 school districts. Students who experienced homelessness were more likely to report risky sexual behavior. Race moderated this link, suggesting that Asian students who experienced homelessness were at greater risk. Homelessness was linked to a greater likelihood of having been tested for STIs/HIV among those who seemed to be in groups recommended for testing. Student sex and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity did not moderate associations between homelessness and risky sexual behavior or STI/HIV testing.

Quantifying the intersection of disability and homelessness in Massachusetts public schools in 2018–2019,"Rubenstein, E.; Bock, E.; Brochu, P.; Byrne, T.","Background: Homelessness has a major impact on the educational and health trajectories of children. Youth with disabilities may be especially vulnerable to experiencing homelessness, but little epidemiological work has been done to characterize dual disparity. Our goal was to describe the relationship between homelessness and disability among students (age 3–21) receiving public education in Massachusetts in 2018–2019. We evaluated the proportion of students with and without disabilities experiencing homelessness by county and school district. Methods: We used publicly available data from the United States and Massachusetts Department's of Education. These data used the McKinney Vento Homelessness Assistance Act definition of homelessness which is a lack of fixed, adequate, and regular housing, and disability was determined by the presence of an individualized education program or individualized family service plan. We calculated percentages of students with and without disabilities experiencing homelessness at the state, county, and district level and calculated and mapped risk of homelessness comparing students and without disability. We also determined the occurrence of disability among those experiencing homelessness. Results: In Massachusetts public schools, 3.5% of students with disabilities experienced homelessness compared with 2.4% of students without disabilities (relative risk 1.50, 95% CI: 1.47, 1.53). A greater proportion of students with disabilities experienced homelessness compared with students without disabilities in all counties. In sum, 24.8% of students experiencing homelessness had a reported disability. Conclusions: In Massachusetts public schools, a greater proportion of students with disabilities experience homelessness compared with students without disabilities, and disability is common among students experiencing homelessness. We hypothesize potential mechanisms, such as the financial cost of disability, that may lead to this finding. Findings support the need for additional funding and interventions for school districts and communities to better serve vulnerable students with disabilities experiencing homelessness. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,,Child Care Health Dev.,48,4,569-577,,10.1111/cch.12961,,#901,Rubenstein 2022,,

Enhancing communication between sexual partners can improve sexual health outcomes, yet little is known about this topic among homeless youth; therefore, this study aimed to examine how homeless youth communicate with their partners about birth control. In-depth semi-structured interviews regarding intimate partner birth control communication were conducted with 10 homeless young women aged 14–22 years following their completion of a comprehensive sexual health program (Wahine Talk). We transcribed the interviews verbatim and used a structured, inductive analytic approach to identify themes. Analysis identified three themes: Getting the Conversation Started, Conversation Content, and Impact of Conversation. Birth control conversations were prompted by programme participation, birth control side effects, and family members’ interest in homeless youth becoming pregnant. Barriers to communication included fear and mistimed conversations (e.g. during the initiation of sex). Homeless young people shared simultaneous desires to delay pregnancy and concerns about side effects of birth control use. Discussions about birth control with their partners may demonstrably improve homeless youth’s intimate relationships and family planning efforts. Providers can support homeless young women by helping them plan conversation timing and addressing fear, including the risk of violence. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Cult.

Feasibility of a computer-assisted social network motivational interviewing intervention to reduce substance use and increase supportive connections among emerging adults transitioning from homelessness to housing,"Kennedy, D.P.; Osilla, K.C.; Tucker, J.S.","Background: Social networks may play positive and negative roles in the lives of young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) who are transitioning into housing. Social networks can influence their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) use, as well as provide immediate and long-term support necessary for a successful transition. Methods: We adapted a four-session computer-assisted motivational interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) for YEH transitioning into housing. We iteratively adapted and beta tested the intervention for delivery by case managers at an organization that provides supportive housing to YEH. We conducted a focus group with agency staff (n = 6), role-play exercises with case managers (n = 3), and semi-structured interviews with residents (n = 6). Interview data were thematically analyzed with open coding. This study presents the first adaptation of an innovative social network-based motivational intervention to reduce AOD use and increase stable, prosocial supportive connections via visualizations of the structure and composition of the individual’s social network. Results: Participants rated sessions as “moderately” to “very” helpful and “good” quality on average. Participants agreed that the sessions were helpful, understandable, and satisfying and would work for new residents. Themes emerged in four broad categories: (1) Acceptability, (2) Positive benefits, (3) Visualization reactions, and (4) MI-SNI interface reactions. For the acceptability category, three sub-themes emerged: (1) understandability, (2) enjoyability and ease of use, (3) and barriers to acceptability. Five sub-themes emerged about the intervention’s likelihood to trigger positive benefits: (1) learning/new insights, (2) enhancement to motivation to change, (3) making AOD changes, (4) building social support, and (5) the intervention’s usefulness to some but not others. Five sub-themes also emerged from comments about the social network visualizations: (1) general positive comments, (2) understandability, (3) new insights, (4) triggering changes in social support, and (5) triggering changes in AOD use. When discussing the MI-SNI intervention interface beyond the visualizations, discussions emerged in three thematic categories: (1) discussion of name listing, (2) discussion of screen wording, and (3) the use of a computer interface to deliver the intervention. Conclusions: Results suggest that the MI-SNI is acceptable to YEH and can be feasibly delivered by case managers during case management sessions.

"Understanding female adolescent ‘runaways’ and the implications of their decisions in Tigray, northern Ethiopia","Lurgain, J.G.; Eyber, C.","Objective: This study aimed to understand the main factors influencing the decision of adolescent girls to run away from home in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, and to explore the social and cultural construction of female adolescent runaways in this region. Method: In-depth qualitative interviews with seven runaway adolescent girls and six women married at an early age (11–16 years old) were conducted in Wukro and Mekelle in Tigray to investigate why the girls escaped from home and how communities responded to these decisions. Results: Findings suggest that the immediate trigger that led all the young participants to run away was to escape an arranged marriage, except in one ‘romantic’ elopement case. Individual and structural factors, such as child maltreatment and educational aspirations, and new family law respectively, also contributed to the decision to escape. Conclusion: Adolescent runaways seem to be ignored or normalized within the community in Tigray and, in particular, by its public institutions. This may explain why there are limited services for runaway girls, such as shelters and other forms of support. This lack of social protection structures has left these girls unprotected and exposed to a range of risks, such as early and unwanted pregnancies, labor exploitation, dropping out of school, and transactional sex. To date, this phenomenon of adolescent runaways has remained an invisible issue in Tigray as runaway girls are counted under general migration figures. Further research is needed to explore how this phenomenon is categorized at policy level in order to address runaway girls’ needs as defined by them. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Child Abuse Negl.,129,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104125,,#912,Lurgain 2022,,
The role of mental health problems in out-of-home care youths' educational pathways: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of Danish longitudinal data,"Bengtsson, T.T.; Olsen, R.F.; Lausten, M.","Background: While the low educational attainment of out-of-home care youth (OHC youth) has been well established, less is known about the role mental health problems play in shaping their educational pathways. Objective: This paper examines how mental health problems influence OHC youths' educational pathways and how this influence can be understood. Participants and setting: The paper draws on a mixed-methods longitudinal study of OHC youth in Denmark. Methods: Sequence and cluster analyses and logistic regressions of survey data (n = 525) and administrative registries were used and combined with narrative analyses of two qualitative cases. Results: We identified four educational pathways: 1) the typical academic pathway, 2) the typical vocational pathway, 3) the disrupted pathway, and 4) the non-completion pathway. Moreover, mental health problems were found to be an essential predicting factor of entrance into the disrupted pathway (3) or the non-completion pathway (4). For youths who entered the disrupted pathway (3), mental health problems appeared to be the key predicting factor. Even though mental health problems also played a fundamental role in entrance into the non-completion pathway (4), we also found a more complex intersection of predictive factors, such as care history, lack of social support, and other social problems, such as cannabis abuse and homelessness. Conclusions: The findings showed a need for a stronger focus on how mental health problems among OHC youths impact their educational pathways. Mental health problems played a key role in OHC youths' transition to independent adulthood and, consequently, their chances for a better life. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Child Abuse Negl.,131,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105782,,#913,Bengtsson 2022,,
Characteristics Associated with Housing Loss Among Youth in a Rapid Rehousing Program,"Youngbloom, A.J.; Farnish, K.A.; Schoenfeld, E.A.","Housing First programs, such as rapid rehousing, are a well-established approach to addressing homelessness among adults, yet there remains a lack of research demonstrating the ability of such services to effectively promote housing stability among youth. Given the paucity of work examining the factors associated with housing stability for formerly homeless youth, the current exploratory study was conducted to determine the characteristics associated with housing loss (i.e., due to evictions or notices to vacate) among youth (N = 60) housed through a rapid rehousing program. Data collected through service delivery at an agency in Austin, Texas, were examined as part of this analysis, including sociodemographic information, mental health and substance misuse, and other background and psychosocial factors. Stepwise regression analyses revealed significant positive associations between youth’s loss of housing and the following three factors: (1) foster care history; (2) identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ); and (3) depression. Results from this study highlight the need for more tailored support for youth who have a history of foster care involvement, identify as LGBTQ, or are experiencing depression as they exit homelessness through a rapid rehousing program. Ensuring adequate and appropriate formal and informal support for these youth can improve the efforts of rapid rehousing programs in promoting housing stability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Child Adolesc.

Reducing the drivers of drug demand in English towns by understanding risk and resilience in the community and developing a framework for partnership action: a mixed methods analysis,"Whitehead, R.; Wells, C.","BACKGROUND: Substance misuse has extensive effects on individuals and communities, ranging from the poor health of people who use drugs to the pressure placed on health care, social services, and the criminal justice system. Strategies to curtail the supply and demand of drugs and reduce these effects typically focus on supply, with less emphasis placed on the drivers of demand. We piloted and evaluated a public health approach for understanding the drivers and effects of substance misuse in a local area, and how these might be targeted for prevention through multi-agency partnership action. METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed methods analysis was conducted, using multi-agency data. 3 years of data provided by criminal justice agencies (police, youth justice, and probation), drug treatment services, social care, education, and hospitals were used to profile the local demand and effect of drugs on individuals and communities in a coastal town in southern England. The experiences of local professionals who support people who misuse drugs, or people affected by drug misuse, were collected via an online survey that was disseminated to relevant partnership organisations, including homelessness charities and drug treatment providers. A public health framework identifying relevant risk and resilience factors in the community was developed by combining the multi-agency data and survey responses The methodological efficacy of this approach to inform partnership action was evaluated via a survey with the project's stakeholders. FINDINGS: Community housing, mental health, and cycles entrenching substance misuse were identified as risk factors that increase individual-level, interpersonal-level, and community-level vulnerabilities to the harms of drug misuse, violence, and exploitation. Evaluation found this mixed-methods analysis for understanding risk and resilience to be a valuable approach to enable public health and community safety leaders to develop a framework for partnership action to reduce the negative effects of drug demand in the community. INTERPRETATION: Analysis of multi-agency data helped to further a shared understanding in local partners of the drivers and effects of drug demand at a local level; and, through a public health lens, clearly identified the role that local organisations can play in minimising the harms of substance misuse and exploitation.

The cohort was divided into four groups: LAI-AP first (started on LAI-AP and later received OAP), OAP first, LAI-AP only, and OAP only. Results: Global assessment of functioning (GAF) improved in all groups, but our mixed-effect model did not show any significant association between the route of administration and the GAF outcome. The LAI-AP only group was significantly less likely to have extreme residential instability at 3 years than the other groups despite its highest proportion of homeless youth and their poor prognostic factors at baseline. Conclusions: Our naturalistic study suggests a significant protective effect of LAI-AP on extreme residential instability for the most vulnerable patients, but no impact of the first AP administration route on other functional outcomes was observed at 3 years of follow-up. Key points Long-acting injectable antipsychotics seem promising to avoid extreme residential instability in early psychosis. Global assessment of functioning (GAF) improved in all groups. There was no significant association between the first route of administration and global functionning. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Int. J. Psychiatry Clin.

Homeless youth shelters and services for transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) clients: Results from a nationwide survey,"Bowers, P.H.; Aguiniga, D.M.; Reamer, D.; Reynolds, J.","This study explored results from a nationwide survey conducted with homeless youth shelter directors. The research sought to further the understanding of how policy and societal changes about gender affirming access to services have affected service delivery and accommodations at homeless youth shelters for transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth. Results from (n = 117) youth shelters indicate the majority of those surveyed are current in implementing many of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) gender affirming policies. Among others, recommendations include a need for shelters to incorporate TGNC safety accommodations, and to update dress code policies from a universal design perspective. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2023,,J.

Queer homelessness: the distinct experiences of sexuality and trans-gender diverse youth,"Hail-Jares, K.; Vichta-Ohlsen, R.; Butler, T.M.; Byrne, J.","Queer young people, or young people who are sexuality diverse and/or trans and gender diverse, face a higher lifetime likelihood of homelessness than their cis-heterosexual peers. However, queer young people are often treated as a homogenous group within research, a methodological decision that obscures differences on the basis of gender identity. Drawing upon 2,159 intake records from a youth housing program in Australia, the authors compare the experiences of (i) cis-heterosexual; (ii) sexuality diverse; and (iii) trans and gender diverse young people across a number of domains related to vulnerability, including victimization and violence, health, substance use, and support systems. Eighteen percent of young people in the sample identified as queer, and five percent identified as trans or gender diverse. Queer young people were more likely to report family and intimate partner violence, poor mental health, and recent substance use than cis-hetero youth. Trans and gender non-conforming respondents were more likely than sexuality diverse peers to be experiencing current, rather than past, family violence, and less likely to report intimate partner violence and substance use. We conclude by discussing these issues within the context of past research and their implication for future research and practice within the homelessness sector. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2023,,J.

Outreach programs to improve life circumstances and prevent further adverse developmental trajectories of at-risk youth in OECD countries: A systematic review,"Filges, T.; Dalgaard, N.T.; Viinholt, B.C.A.","Background: At-risk youth may be defined as a diverse group of young people in unstable life circumstances, who are currently experiencing or are at risk of developing one or more serious problems. At-risk youth are often very unlikely to seek out help for themselves within the established venues, as their adverse developmental trajectories have installed a lack of trust in authorities such as child protection agencies and social workers. To help this population, a number of outreach programmes have been established seeking to help the young people on an ad hoc basis, meaning that the interventions are designed to fit the individual needs of each young person rather than as a one-size-fits-all treatment model. The intervention in this review is targeted outreach work which may be (but does not have to be) multicomponent programmes in which outreach may be combined with other services. Objectives: The main objective of this review was to answer the following research questions: What are the effects of outreach programmes on problem/high-risk behaviour of young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries? Are they less likely to experience an adverse outcome such as school failure or drop-out, runaway and homelessness, substance and/or alcohol abuse, unemployment, long-term poverty, delinquency and more serious criminal behaviour?. Search Methods: We identified relevant studies through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, governmental and grey literature repositories, hand search in specific targeted journals, citation tracking, and Internet search engines. The database searches were carried out in September 2020 and other resources were searched in October and November 2021. We searched to identify both published and unpublished literature, and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were searched. Selection Criteria: The intervention was targeted outreach work which may have been combined with other services. Young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries, who either have experienced or is at-risk of experiencing an adverse outcome were eligible. Our primary focus was on measures of problem/high-risk behaviour and a secondary focus was on social and emotional outcomes. All study designs that used a well-defined control group were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilised qualitative approaches were not included. Data Collection and Analysis: The total number of potentially relevant studies constituted 17,659 hits. A total of 16 studies (17 different interventions) met the inclusion criteria. Only five studies could be used in the data synthesis. Eight studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to have critical risk of bias and, in accordance with the protocol, were excluded from the meta-analysis on the basis that they would be more likely to mislead than inform. Two studies (three interventions) did not provide enough information enabling us to calculate an effect size and standard error, and one study did not provide enough information to assess risk of bias. Meta-analysis of all outcomes were conducted on each conceptual outcome separately. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models incorporating both the sampling variance and between study variance components into the study level weights. Random effects weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using 95% confidence intervals. Too few studies were included to carry out any sensitivity analyses. Main Results: Four of the five studies used for meta analysis were from the USA and one was from Canada. The timespan in which included studies were carried out was 32 years, from 1985 to 2017; on average the intervention year was 2005. The average number of participants in the analysed interventions was 116, ranging from 30 to 346 and the average number of controls was 81, ranging from 32 to 321. At most, the results from two studies could be pooled in a single meta-analysis. It was only possible to pool the outcomes drug (other than marijuana) use, marijuana use and alcohol use each at two different time points (one and 3 months follow up). At 1 month follow up the weighted averages varied between zero and 0.05 and at 3 months follow up between −0.17 and 0.07. None of them were statistically significant. In addition, a number of other outcomes were reported in a single study only. Authors' Conclusions: Overall, there were too few studies included in any of the meta-analyses in order for us to draw any conclusion concerning the effectiveness of outreach. The vast majority of studies were undertaken in the USA. The dominance of the USA as the main country in which outreach interventions meeting our inclusion criteria have been evaluated using rigorous methods and within our specific parameters clearly limits the generalisability of the findings. None of the studies, however, was considered to be of overall high quality in our risk of bias assessment and the process of excluding studies with critical risk of bias from the meta-analysis applied in this review left us with only five of a total of 16 possible studies to synthesise. Further, because too few studies reported results on the same type of outcome at most two studies could be combined in a particular meta-analysis. Given the limited number of rigorous studies available from countries other than the USA, it would be natural to consider conducting a series of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of outreach for at-risk youth in countries outside the USA. The trial(s) should be designed, conducted and reported according to methodological criteria for rigour in respect of internal and external validity to achieve robust results and preferably reporting a larger number of outcomes. © 2022 The Authors.

Sex differences in poly-victimization among youth experiencing homelessness prior to substance use treatment,"DiGuiseppi, G.T.; Ring, C.R.; Rice, E.R.; Davis, J.P.","Background: Poly-victimization is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and youth in substance use treatment. To date, studies have not examined poly-victimization among these two intersecting populations. Objective: To examine heterogeneity in lifetime victimization experiences among youth reporting homelessness at substance use treatment entry; identify demographic predictors of victimization class membership; and associations between victimization and clinical characteristics at treatment intake. Participants and setting: 1270 adolescents and young adults reporting past 90-day homelessness in a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Methods: Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and logistic regression were used to examine heterogeneity in poly-victimization experiences, and associations with demographics and clinical characteristics for males and females. Results: Four victimization classes emerged for males, and five victimization classes emerged for females. The prevalence of victimization and trauma characteristics were higher for females, except physical victimization, which was higher for males. Age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status were related to poly-victimization class membership, but not consistently across classes. Compared to low or single victimization classes, youth in the poly-victimization class had higher odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and exchange sex (among females); Poly-victimization class membership was not associated with duration of recent homelessness or substance use disorder diagnoses, when compared to low/less complex victimization. Conclusion: High rates of lifetime victimization were found for YEH in substance use treatment, with rates generally higher among females. Trauma-informed interventions are needed to address complex victimization experiences and poor mental health among unstably housed youth in treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Child Abuse Negl.,129,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105670,,#928,DiGuiseppi 2022,,
Barriers to and facilitators of accessing HIV services for street-involved youth in Canada and Kenya,"Khan, M.; MacEntee, K.; Kiptui, R.; Van Berkum, A.; Oudshoorn, A.; Ayuku, D.O.; Apondi, E.; Lee, E.O.J.; Abramovich, A.; MacDonald, S.-A.; Braitstein, P.","Introduction: UNICEF estimates that there are as many as 100 million street-involved youth (SIY) globally. Marginalized conditions put SIY at higher risk of HIV and adverse outcomes once HIV-positive. The objective of this analysis was to describe barriers and facilitators of accessing HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services as Phase I of an implementation study evaluating the use of peer navigators to increase access to HIV services. Methods: Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and theatre testing were conducted with individuals who identify as SIY, health care providers, and community stakeholders living in Canada (Toronto, Montreal, London) and Kenya (Eldoret, Huruma, Kitale). Data were analyzed using a directed content approach, guided by the socio-ecological model (SEM). Results: Across the six sites were 195 participants: 64 SIY, 42 healthcare providers, and 97 community-based stakeholders. Barriers were identified at the societal (e.g. intersectional stigma and discrimination), public policy (e.g., inadequate access to basic needs, legal documentation, lack of health insurance, and limited community-based funding), institutional (e.g. lack of inclusive education and training, inadequate HIV educational outreach, and restrictive service provision), interpersonal (e.g., ineffective communication from healthcare providers), and intrapersonal levels (e.g. lack of trust and associated fear, low perception for healthcare, and lack of self-esteem). These contributed to limited HIV services utilization among SIY. Conversely, numerous facilitators were also identified at the public policy (e.g. affordable HIV services and treatment), institutional (e.g. available and accessible HIV prevention tools, HIV education and awareness programs, and holistic models of care), interpersonal level (e.g., systems navigation support, peer support, and personal relationships), and intrapersonal levels (e.g. self-efficacy) as positively supporting SIY access to HIV services. Conclusion: Intersectional stigma was a critical barrier in all sites, and policies and programs that foster welcoming environments for youth from diverse backgrounds and living circumstances may be better able to respond to the HIV service needs of this high risk population. Social support and navigation services were reported to facilitate access to HIV services in all sites. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Public Health,22,1,,,10.1186/s12889-022-14290-7,,#932,Khan 2022,,
Examining COVID-19 vaccine uptake and attitudes among 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness,"Abramovich, A.; Pang, N.; Kunasekaran, S.; Moss, A.; Kiran, T.; Pinto, A.D.","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness. Little is known about vaccine attitudes and uptake among this population. To address this, the objectives of this study were to explore this group’s COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, and facilitators and barriers impacting vaccine uptake. Methods: 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area were recruited to participate in online surveys assessing demographic characteristics, mental health, health service use, and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were used to analyze survey data to explore variables associated with vaccine confidence. Additionally, a select group of youth and frontline workers from youth serving organizations were invited to participate in online one-on-one interviews. An iterative thematic content approach was used to analyze interview data. Quantitative and qualitative data were merged for interpretation by use of a convergent parallel analytical design. Results: Ninety-two youth completed surveys and 32 youth and 15 key informants participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that the majority of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness were confident in the COVID-19 vaccine; however, numerous youth were non-vaccine confident due to mistrust in the healthcare system, lack of targeted vaccine-related public health information, concerns about safety and side effects, and accessibility issues. Solutions to increase vaccine confidence were provided, including fostering trust, targeted public health messaging, and addressing accessibility needs. Conclusion: Our study highlights the need for the vaccine strategy and rollouts to prioritize 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and to address the pervasive health disparities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Public Health,22,1,,,10.1186/s12889-022-12537-x,,#935,Abramovich 2022,,
Pregnancy and parenting support for youth experiencing homelessness,"Eapen, D.J.; Bergh, R.; Narendorf, S.C.; Santa Maria, D.M.","This study explored the perceptions and experiences related to pregnancy and parenting support among youth while homeless. This study employed a qualitative descriptive design using data collected from focus group discussions. We assessed the experiences and perceptions of youth related to pregnancy and parenting support. Eighty-one youth participated in eight focus group discussions and were recruited from shelters, drop-in centers, and organizations that serve youth in a large metropolitan areas in the southern United States. Thematic content analyses were used to generate results from the qualitative data. Four main themes emerged: youth encountered barriers to accessing healthcare services at the individual and system levels; pregnancy and parenting are stressful, especially during homelessness; support can help overcome the stresses of parenting; and embracing responsibility or “stepping up” is a positive influence of pregnancy and parenting during homelessness. Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face significant challenges to accessing healthcare services and adjusting to the parental role. Interventions for pregnant and parenting youth should be co-designed with and tailored for youth and address the existing health inequities within the healthcare and social service systems. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,,Public Health Nurs.,39,4,728-735,,10.1111/phn.13055,,#938,Eapen 2022,,

Methods: With New York statewide databases, a case–control design was conducted. Cases and controls were homeless patients with an ED visit or hospitalization due to suicide attempt (cases) or appendicitis (controls) between April and December. We examined ED and inpatient records for 90 days prior to the visit for suicide attempt or appendicitis. The primary exposure variable was prior healthcare utilization for any reason other than the following four reasons: mental health disorder, substance use, self-harm, and other injuries. Multivariable logistic regression models, with year fixed effect and hospital random effect, were used. Results: A total of 335 cases and 742 controls were identified. Cases had lower odds of prior healthcare utilization for any reason other than the four reasons listed above. (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 0.53, p-value = 0.03).

How Ethnic Minority Context Alters the Risk for Developing Mental Health Disorders and Psychological Distress for Latinx Young Adults,"Alegría, M.; Cruz-Gonzalez, M.; Alvarez, K.; Canino, G.; Duarte, C.; Bird, H.; Ramos-Olazagasti, M.; Lapatin Markle, S.; O'malley, I.; Vila, D.; Shrout, P.E.","Policy Points In low-income communities in the South Bronx and Puerto Rico, Puerto Rican youth are exposed to many of the same risk and protective factors for developing depression, anxiety, or psychological distress; yet it is unclear how the ethnic minority context of the South Bronx and ethnic majority context of Puerto Rico influence risk. Results from our quasi-experimental, longitudinal study demonstrate the importance of addressing social factors (parent-child relationships, youth peer relationships) for youth living in the majority context, and neighborhood and cultural factors (residential mobility, perceived discrimination, perceived social position in the neighborhood) for youth living in the minority context. Our findings support the need for tailoring programs specific to the needs of youth who reside in an ethnic majority or a minority context, since some of the risk factors might operate differently depending on context. Housing and neighborhood environment policies that address discrimination and eliminate structural inequities for ethnic minority groups may protect against the harm of minoritization on young people's mental health. Context: Puerto Rican youth growing up in low-income communities in the South Bronx and Puerto Rico are exposed to many of the same risk factors for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychological distress. One potentially powerful factor differs: Puerto Ricans have been socially marginalized as an ethnic minority group in the South Bronx, but are the ethnic majority of the population in Puerto Rico. A growing body of literature demonstrates the influence of neighborhood, cultural, and social factors and parental psychopathology in the development of mental health problems. An important unanswered question is whether these risk and protective factors have the same impact for youth raised as members of an ethnic majority versus minority group. Methods: Using a population-based cohort study, with four waves of assessment from early childhood into young adulthood, we investigated whether ethnic minority context alters risk and protective factors for depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Our longitudinal data set includes 2,491 young children at baseline (82.8% retained at wave 4). Using a quasi-experimental design, we examine how ethnic minority context can alter the development of mental health disorders as Latinx children transition to late adolescence and young adulthood. Findings: Some risk and protective factors operated differently across minority and majority contexts. Higher discrimination and social position were more powerful risk and protective factors, respectively, in the minority context, whereas positive peer relationships mattered more in the majority context. Children of mothers with depression were significantly more likely to develop anxiety in late adolescence and young adulthood in the majority context (60.0%) compared to the minority context (4.5%). Conclusions: Preventing depression and anxiety disorders in Latinx young adults may require targeting different childhood factors depending on whether they reside within the ethnic majority or minority context. People in the ethnic minority context may benefit more from policies aimed at reducing discrimination and improving economic opportunity, while people in the majority context may benefit more from opportunities for strengthening family and peer relationships. © 2022 Milbank Memorial Fund.",2022,,Milbank Q.,100,2,424-463,,10.1111/1468-0009.12552,,#946,Alegría 2022,,

Cross-sectional data from the 2014 Kampala Youth Survey (n = 1134) of youth aged 12 to 18 years recruited from Uganda Youth Development Link drop-in centers were used to conduct the analyses. Multivariable statistics were computed to determine the correlates (i.e., sex, education, homelessness, problem drinking, and SV) for (1) self-efficacy to refuse sex, (2) self-efficacy to refuse sex while drinking, and (3) regretting sex due to alcohol use. Among participants, 16.9% reported SV (79% were female and 21% were male). In the final adjusted model, self-efficacy to refuse sex while drinking was only associated with homelessness (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.74). Previous SV was not associated with lower self-reports of self-efficacy to refuse sex compared to those who had not experienced SV.

Who Is Couch-Surfing and Who Is on the Streets? Disparities Among Racial and Sexual Minority Youth in Experiences of Homelessness,"Petry, L.; Hill, C.; Milburn, N.; Rice, E.","Purpose: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) often engage in “couch-surfing,” or frequently moving from one tenuous living arrangement to another. Understanding the characteristics and risk factors associated with couch-surfing is necessary to designing adequate responses to youth homelessness. The present study aims to investigate factors associated with youth at risk of couch-surfing or sleeping on the streets relative to staying in a shelter. Methods: The present study used Homeless Management Information System administrative data sourced from 16 communities across the U.S. between January 2015 and February 2017 (n = 9,417). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to explore correlates (e.g., demographics, homeless histories, risk and victimization, behavioral health, and self-sufficiency) of couch-surfing or sleeping on the streets relative to staying in an emergency shelter program. Results: YEH identifying as female; Black or another non-Latinx youth of color; or as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or another sexual orientation (LGBQ+) were at greater risk of couch-surfing relative to staying in a shelter. YEH who threatened to harm themselves or others in the preceding 12 months or who attributed their homelessness to an abusive relationship were significantly more likely to either be couch-surfing or on the streets. Discussion: Service providers must recognize and validate the vulnerabilities and risks experienced by couch-surfing YEH in order to help reduce barriers to accessing services faced by this population.

"Eliminating Disparities in Youth Substance Use Among Native Hawaiian, Micronesian, and Sex and Gender Minorities: A Qualitative Needs Assessment From Interviews With Public Service Leaders","Monick, B.; Rehuher, D.; Wilczek, K.; Helm, S.","Youth substance use (SU) has been linked to adverse mental health outcomes. For those youth involved in public sector systems of care, reports of SU are consistently high compared to general populations. These public sector services systems of care include mental health, juvenile justice, child welfare, homeless intervention services, as well as SU service systems. In addition, minority and marginalized youth tend to report disproportionately high SU. As an example, in Hawai‘i, youth who are Native Hawaiian (NH), Micronesian, or who identify as sexual or gender minorities not only report elevated rates of SU, but are overrepresented in public sectors. In order to reduce youth SU health disparities, access to and quality of the system of care for youth must improve. To inform systems change, this needs assessment study used qualitative methods to engage professionals in Hawai‘i working within public sectors that may intersect with youth SU service system of care.

From 2017-2018, 100 TAY between the ages of 18 and 24 in San Francisco were recruited from Larkin Street Youth Services into a cross-sectional study. Participants completed surveys on mental health, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors. A syndemic score ranging from 0-3 was calculated by summing dichotomous measures of moderate or severe anxiety in the past two weeks, PTSD symptoms in the past month and polysubstance use in the past three months. We used modified Poisson regression with robust error variances to identify the correlates of being at risk of clinical depression in the past week, all primary effects measures were modeled separately. Among 100 participants, the average age was 21 (SD = 1.7), 67% were male, 38% were Multiracial, 54% identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or pansexual, 13% were unstably housed, 50% were homeless and 23% were living with HIV. The majority (74%) were at risk of clinical depression, 51% had symptoms of moderate or severe anxiety, 80% exhibited symptoms of PTSD and 33% reported polysubstance use. After controlling for age in years, gender, race/ethnicity and sexual orientation, factors independently associated with being at risk of clinical depression were; symptoms of moderate or severe anxiety (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.12, P<0.001), symptoms of PTSD (aRR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.58- 9.04, P = 0.003), polysubstance use (aRR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.06-1.68), P = 0.012), an increasing syndemic score (aRR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.21-1.62), P<0.001), and having one, two or three syndemic factors (compared to none); (aRR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.08-6.65, P = 0.032), (aRR = 3.24, 95% CI = 1.24-7.83, P = 0.003) and (aRR = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.65-9.52, P = 0.002), respectively.

Does the source matter? Social support and suicide attempts among homeless youth,"Fulginiti, A.; Negriff, S.; Call, J.; Rice, E.","The impact of social support on suicide is understudied among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). This is problematic because assumptions about the protectiveness of relationships may not generalize to conflictive YEH environments. This study, which included 1047 YEH, used path modeling with a logistic regression estimator to examine associations between social support from family, home-based friends, and street-based friends and past-year suicide attempt.

Substance Use and Mental Health Outcomes from a Text Messaging-Based Intervention for Smoking Cessation Among Young People Experiencing Homelessness,"Pedersen, E.R.; Linnemayr, S.; Shadel, W.G.; Zutshi, R.; Deyoreo, M.; Cabreros, I.; Tucker, J.S.","Introduction: Cigarette smoking and associated high-risk behaviors are prevalent among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), making appropriately tailored interventions targeting smoking behavior important for this group. We pilot tested a brief text-messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to standard care for YEH who smoke and found promising preliminary effects of the intervention on smoking cessation. The purpose of the present study was to test the TMI's effect on the secondary outcomes of other substance use (including use of other tobacco/nicotine devices) and mental health symptoms. Methods: A total of 77 participants completed the pilot randomized controlled trial, with 40 receiving the TMI (174 automated text messages plus a group smoking counseling session and provision of nicotine patches). They completed an assessment at baseline and another three months later that evaluated use of other tobacco/nicotine devices, alcohol, marijuana, and anxiety and depression symptoms. Results: We found that the TMI helped to reduce secondary substance use behaviors and mental health symptoms among the participants; mainly there were medium effects of the intervention on changes in other tobacco/nicotine use, drinking, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The intervention did not have an effect on number of marijuana use days in the past month; however, past 30-day marijuana users who received the intervention benefited by reducing the number of times they used marijuana per day. Conclusions: In addition to helping reduce cigarette smoking, we found that a TMI for YEH was helpful in improving secondary outcomes, suggesting the promise of the TMI on benefiting YEH even beyond targeted smoking behavior. Implications: This pilot study demonstrates that by targeting cigarette smoking using a text message-based intervention among youth experiencing homelessness, effects may be seen in other areas of functioning such as other substance use and mental health.

"A Peer-Led, Artificial Intelligence-Augmented Social Network Intervention to Prevent HIV Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness","Rice, E.; Wilder, B.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Diguiseppi, G.; Petering, R.; Hill, C.; Yadav, A.; Lee, S.-J.; Tambe, M.","Background:Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at elevated risk of HIV/AIDS and disproportionately identify as racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. We developed a new peer change agent (PCA) HIV prevention intervention with 3 arms: (1) an arm using an artificial intelligence (AI) planning algorithm to select PCAs; (2) a popularity arm, the standard PCA approach, operationalized as highest degree centrality (DC); and (3) an observation-only comparison group.Setting:A total of 713 YEH were recruited from 3 drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA.Methods:Youth consented and completed a baseline survey that collected self-reported data on HIV knowledge, condom use, and social network information. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was used; 472 youth (66.5% retention at 1 month postbaseline) and 415 youth (58.5% retention at 3 months postbaseline) completed follow-up. In each intervention arm (AI and DC), 20% of youth was selected as PCAs and attended a 4-hour initial training, followed by 7 weeks of half-hour follow-up sessions. Youth disseminated messages promoting HIV knowledge and condom use.Results:Using generalized estimating equation models, there was a significant reduction over time (P < 0.001) and a significant time by AI arm interaction (P < 0.001) for condomless anal sex act. There was a significant increase in HIV knowledge over time among PCAs in DC and AI arms.Conclusions:PCA models that promote HIV knowledge and condom use are efficacious for YEH. Youth are able to serve as a bridge between interventionists and their community. Interventionists should consider working with computer scientists to solve implementation problems.

"Glue Sniffing Among the Street Children Residing at Pokhara Metropolitan, Nepal: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","Acharya, A.; Shrestha, N.; Paudel, S.","Introduction: Glue sniffing usually refers to volatile substance abuse (VSA) for psychoactive effects. Street children are the children who live, work, and earn their livelihood through the streets of urban settlements. Street children are mostly attracted to substance abuse and more particularly towards volatile substances as they are cheap, easy to access and have psychoactive effects as alcohol intoxication. This study aimed to assess the general characteristics of street children of Pokhara Metropolitan, Nepal who are addicted to glue sniffing. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among street children who were addicted to glue sniffing through the snowball sampling method in Pokhara Metropolitan, Nepal. Results: All 88 children who were addicted to glue sniffing were males. Of the total children, 59 (67%) children started glue-sniffing at the age of five to ten years of age while nine (10.2%) children started sniffing even before they were five years old. Addiction to glue (n = 33, 37.5%), pleasure (n = 18, 20.5%)), coping with hunger (n = 14, 15.9%), and being a part of street children group (n = 13, 14.8%) were the major reasons to sniff glue for these children. Conclusions: It has been observed that the majority of street children are at increased risk of getting involved in glue sniffing. It has resulted in different ill outcomes such as self-destruction and problematic behavior, fights and police arrest. There is a need to focus on the issue of glue sniffing among the street children to save and ensure the quality of life of these vulnerable children. © 2022 by author(s)..",2022,,J. Nepal Paediatr.

Motivational network intervention to reduce substance use and increase supportive connections among formerly homeless emerging adults transitioning to housing: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,"Tucker, J.S.; Kennedy, D.P.; Osilla, K.C.; Golinelli, D.","Background: Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections. Methods/design: Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support + MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident’s network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year. Discussion: This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

Ageing with psychosis – Fifty and beyond,"Galletly, C.; Suetani, S.; Hahn, L.; McKellar, D.; Castle, D.","Objective: While there is considerable current emphasis on youth and early psychosis, relatively little is known about the lives of people who live with psychotic disorders into middle age and beyond. We investigated social functioning, physical health status, substance use and psychiatric symptom profile in people with psychotic disorders aged between 50 and 65 years. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Survey of High Impact Psychosis, a population-based survey of Australians aged 18–65 years with a psychotic disorder. We compared those aged 50–65 years (N = 347) with those aged 18–49 years (N = 1478) across a range of measures. Results: The older group contained more women and more people with affective psychoses compared to the younger group. They were also more likely to have had a later onset and a chronic course of illness. The older group were more likely to have negative symptoms but less likely to exhibit positive symptoms; they also had lower current cognition, compared to the younger group. Compared to the younger group, the older group were more likely to be divorced/separated, to be living alone and to be unemployed. They had substantially lower lifetime use of alcohol and illicit substances, but rates of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus were higher. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the characteristics of people with psychosis change significantly as they progress into the middle age and beyond. A better understanding of these differences is important in informing targeted treatment strategies for older people living with psychosis. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2021.",2022,,Aust.

Making home? Permitted and prohibited place-making in youth homeless accommodation,"Hoolachan, J.","Based on the premise that ‘home’ is more than bricks and mortar, a growing body of literature has considered how the concept might be applied to homelessness. Aligned with ‘home’, home-making refers to the construction of living spaces so that their sensory features and the practices that occur there create a pleasant environment that enhances wellbeing. However, the instability and structural constraints within which homeless people live can limit their ability to home-make. Hence, in this article, ‘place-making’ proved a useful alternative concept. This article draws on an ethnographic study in Scotland involving 22 young people and 27 staff who lived and worked respectively in a supported accommodation hostel. It demonstrates how the residents engaged in sensory practices within the tightly regulated confines of the hostel. A distinction is made between ‘permitted’ and ‘prohibited’ practices to argue that home-making is not a morally-neutral concept. Rather there are ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ ways for homeless people to personalise their living spaces. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,,Hous.

Exploring urinary biomarkers to assess oxidative DNA damage resulting from BTEX exposure in street children,"Rafiee, A.; Delgado-Saborit, J.M.; Sly, P.D.; Amiri, H.; Hoseini, M.","Children are highly susceptible to environmental contaminants as their physiology and some metabolic pathways differ from adults. The present cross-sectional study aimed to assess whether exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o,p-xylene, and m-xylene (BTEX) affects oxidative DNA damage in street children using a biomonitoring approach. Thirty-five boys (7–13 years of age), exposed by working at a busy intersection, and 25 unexposed boys of similar age and living in the neighborhood near the busy intersection were recruited. Urinary un-metabolized BTEX levels were quantified by a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Urinary malonaldehyde (MDA) was measured with spectrophotometry. Sociodemographic and lifestyle conditions information was collected by interviews using administered questionnaires. Exposed subjects provided urine before (BE) and after work exposure (AE), while unexposed boys gave a single morning sample. Urinary BTEX concentrations in BE samples were similar to unexposed. Concentrations in AE samples were 2.36-fold higher than observed in BE samples (p < 0.05) and higher than those in the unexposed group (p < 0.05). In addition, urinary MDA levels in AE samples were 3.2 and 3.07-times higher than in BE samples and in the unexposed group (p < 0.05). Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increased urinary BTEX and MDA levels in both groups. Our findings confirm that street children working at busy intersections are significantly exposed to BTEX, which is associated with oxidative stress. Implementing protective measures is crucial to reduce exposure and to improve health outcomes in this group. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2022,,Environ.

"Psychic geographies of queer multiculturalism: Reading Fanon, settler colonialism and race in queer space","Rosenberg, R.","Utilizing Fanon’s theories of psychic, social and embodied processes of racialization and racism, this article examines Toronto’s gay village as a site of queer settler multiculturalism and its impacts on Black and Indigenous lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit and additional (LGBTQ2+) youth experiencing homelessness. I build on Fanon’s arguments of cultural alienation, the collective unconscious and white colonial anxiety and desire to analyze current iterations of queer settler colonialism and anti-Black racism within the village. Specifically, I argue that the village maintains a collective queer multicultural unconscious through social interactions and forms of representation that seek to tightly control Blackness and Indigeneity within queer space. By placing Fanon in dialogue with Black and Indigenous Studies scholarship, and interviews with Black and Indigenous LGBTQ2+ youth, I present how youth encounter and, to some extent, refuse the white and settler colonial queer multiculturalism in Toronto’s village. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Environ.

To estimate the prevalence and factors associated with risky sexual behavior among children and adolescents living on the street in Porto Alegre and Rio Grande. A cross-sectional study was carried out using the Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) sampling method to quickly and efficiently access populations of difficult access. Poisson regression with robust adjustment of variance was used in the multivariate analysis. The sample consisted of 231 participants aged 10–21 years. Most were male and aged 16- 21 years. More than half (66.7%) of the respondents did not have a school bond, and 64.5% did not live with the family. Half of the sample had been living on the street for at least four years, spending 15 h or more on the street. Most (86.6%) responded that they had already used illicit drugs in their lives, and unprotected sex prevalence was 61.9%. The variables independently associated with unprotected sex were years living on the street, hours spent on the street, having a steady partner, illicit drug use, and sexual intercourse without a condom under the influence of drugs. The high prevalence of unprotected sex points to the need for intervention policies for this population to prevent the main risk factors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,,J.

Profiles of individuals with cannabis-related disorders,"Fleury, M.-J.; Grenier, G.; Cao, Z.; Huỳnh, C.","Background: Profiles of individuals with cannabis-related disorders (CRD) in specialized addiction treatment centers serving high-need patients have not been identified. This longitudinal study developed a typology for 9,836 individuals with CRD attending Quebec (Canada) addiction treatment centers in 2012–2013. Methods: Data on sociodemographic, clinical and service use variables were extracted from several databases for the years 1996–1997 to 2014–2015. Individual profiles were produced using Latent Class Analysis and compared predicting health outcomes on emergency department (ED) use, hospitalizations and suicidal behaviors for 2015–2016. Results: Six profiles were identified: 1-Older individuals, many living in couples and working, with moderate health problems, receiving intensive general practitioner (GP) care and high continuity of physician care; 2-Older individuals with chronic CRD, multiple social and health problems, and low health service use (chronic CRD referred to experiencing CRD for several years; social problems related to homelessness, unemployment, having criminal records or living alone); 3-Students with few social and health problems, and low health service use; 4-Young adults, many working, with few health problems, least health service use and continuity of physician care; 5-Youth, many working but some criminal offenders, with 1 or 2 years of CRD, few health problems and high addiction treatment center use; and 6-Older individuals with chronic CRD and multiple social and health problems, high health service use and continuity of physician care.

Yet few large-scale assessments of these differences among high school students exist. The youth risk behavior survey (YRBS) is conducted biennially among local, state, and nationally representative samples of U.S. high school students in grades 9–12. In 2019, 23 states and 11 local school districts included a measure for housing status on their YRBS questionnaire. The prevalence of homelessness was assessed among states and local sites, and relationships between housing status and violence victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual risk behaviors were evaluated using logistic regression. Compared with stably housed students, students experiencing homelessness were twice as likely to report misuse of prescription pain medicine, three times as likely to be threatened or injured with a weapon at school, and three times as likely to report attempting suicide.

Aboriginal Community Co-Design and Co-Build—Far More than a House,"Rodd, K.; Romero, J.; Hunter, V.; Martyn, S.V.","There is urgent need for a new model to address the housing crisis in remote Australian Indigenous communities. Decades of major government expenditure have not significantly improved the endemic problems, which include homelessness, overcrowding, substandard dwellings, and unemployment. Between 2017–2020, Foundation for Indigenous Sustainable Health (FISH) worked with the remote Kimberley Aboriginal community, Bawoorrooga, by facilitating the co-design and co-build of a culturally and climatically appropriate home with community members. This housing model incorporates a program of education, health, governance, justice system programs, and land tenure reforms. Build features incorporate sustainable local/recycled materials and earth construction, and ‘Solar Passive Design’. The project faced challenges, including limited funding, extreme climate and remoteness, cultural barriers, and mental health issues. Nevertheless, the program was ultimately successful, producing a house which is culturally designed, climatically/thermally effective, comparatively cheap to build, and efficient to run. The project produced improvements in mental health, schooling outcomes, reduced youth incarceration, and other spheres of community development, including enterprise and community governance. Co-design and co-build projects are slower and more complex than the conventional model of external contracting, but the outcomes can be far superior across broad areas of social and emotional wellbeing, house quality and comfort, energy consumption, long-term maintenance, community physical and mental health, pride, and ownership. These factors are essential in breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty, trauma, and engagement with the justice system.

Differential risks: How disability shapes risk in the transition to adulthood for youth who age out of foster care,"McCauley, E.","Objective: This study examines how disability is associated with risk during the transition to adulthood for youth who age out of foster care and considers how experiences in the child welfare system contribute to these associations. Background: The transition to adulthood is important for later socioeconomic standing, health, and wellbeing. Youth who age out of foster care with disabilities may require a high level of support during this transition yet may lack support. Method: This study employs linear probability models to estimate the association between disability and incarceration, homelessness, childbearing, and substance abuse between ages 17 and 21 using linked administrative data from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (N = 5,221). Results: Having a physical or sensory disability is associated with lower risk in the transition to adulthood. Alternatively, having an emotional or mental related disability is associated with increased risk of incarceration and homelessness, but the association with homelessness is accounted for by child welfare experiences. Conclusion: Due to the importance of foster care and child protective histories in explaining some risky outcomes for youth with emotional and mental disabilities, policy makers and practitioners should include those early stages of care when seeking it improve outcomes in the transition to adulthood for youth with disabilities who age out of foster care. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child.

Factors influencing the well-being of Asian American LGBT individuals across the lifespan: perspectives from leaders of community-based organizations,"Matthews, A.K.; Li, C.-C.; Bernhardt, B.; Sohani, S.; Dong, X.Q.","Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals have documented disparities in mental health that are experienced across the life course. However, limited research has been conducted to identify the factors which contribute to evaluated risk for poor mental health among older Asian Americans who identify as LGBT. The purpose of this study was to determine the perspectives of leaders of community-based organizations about the mental health needs and concerns of their LGBT constituents from diverse Asian backgrounds. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with leaders of community-based organizations serving the needs of LGBT individuals. A qualitative framework analysis approach was used to identify, analyze and report themes within the data. Results: 11 members of community organizations located in California (54.5%), Chicago (27.2%), and New York (18.1%) were interviewed. Chronic stress was identified as negatively impacting constituents’ lives and was attributed to social determinants of health, including inadequate housing, financial insecurity, discrimination, barriers to adequate health care, and immigration status. Ageism, social isolation, language barriers, and limited connections to cultural, religious, or LGBT communities were identified as factors impacting middle-aged and older adults. Participants identified homelessness, violence, and lack of parental acceptance as contributing to distress among youth and younger adults. The most vulnerable community members were identified as gender minorities, undocumented individuals, and individuals with limited English proficiencies. Organizational leaders described strategies to address social determinants.

"Queer/y/ing pathways through youth homelessness: becoming, being and leaving LGBTQI+ youth homelessness","Quilty, A.; Norris, M.","This article extends Clapham’s (2002) concept of ‘housing pathways’ to explore the nature of specific youth homelessness associated with diverse LGBTQI+ identities. Drawing on in-depth interviews with homeless LGBTQI+ youth in Ireland we offer a queer consideration of the structural challenges and agentic potentialities of young people’s housing pathways. Building on these young people’s experiences of becoming, being and leaving homelessness our queering process focuses on three phenomena: queer temporalities, queer liminalities and queer kinships. We argue that due to their evolving sexualities and gender identities ‘housing and home’ have distinctive meanings for LGBTQI+ youth. These meanings prioritise safe, non-homophobic/transphobic spaces, in which they can be themselves without the pressure to conceal their evolving identities or conform to heteronormative expectations. We suggest these meanings inform pathways into, through and out of homelessness and may contribute to higher rates of homelessness among LGBTQI+ youth. Finally, we argue these queerly informed understandings increase knowledge of how proactive interventions might best be framed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,,Hous.

"Factors contributing to frequent police contact among young people: a multivariate analysis including homelessness, community visibility, and drug use in British Columbia, Canada","Greer, A.; Selfridge, M.; Card, K.; Benoit, C.; Jansson, M.; Lee, Z.; Macdonald, S.","There is increasing recognition and attention towards the patterns of police encounters with citizens. In this study, we examine the determinants of being stopped and questioned by the police among a heterogenous sample of adolescents and young adults, who were either people who use drugs and a comparison group, in three non-metropolitan areas of British Columbia, Canada. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify the unique variation of frequent police encounters based on demographic characteristics and potential confounders. Of 448 young people, 92.0% reported at least one event where police stopped and questioned them in the past five years, and half (49.8%) reported frequent (four or more) police encounters in this time frame. The demographics of race, age, and gender were not significant in the analyses, whereas weekly illicit drug use, homelessness, and high visibility in the community were significantly related to frequent police encounters. Findings suggest that, controlling for demographic variables, young people who have precarious housing, use drugs, and have higher community visibility are at higher risk of police contact. Our findings also show when street involvement and drug use are controlled for, race does not determine police encounters. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,,Drugs Educ.

"Experiences of family violence among 2SLGBTQ + youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Abramovich, A.; Pang, N.; Moss, A.","Introduction: Family violence is the leading cause of homelessness among youth; however, limited research has examined family violence among 2SLGBTQ + youth experiencing homelessness. The objective of this study was to engage a group of 2SLGBTQ + youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area and surrounding areas in Ontario, Canada, to examine their experiences of family violence before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: 2SLGBTQ + youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness and key informants (service providers) participated in online surveys and one-on-one interviews to assess family violence during the pandemic. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed separately and merged for interpretation. Results: The majority of youth experienced various forms of family violence throughout their lives, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Localized Engineering in Displacement: An Alternative Model for Out-of-School Youth and Refugee Students to Engineer their own Solutions for their own Communities,"Deboer, J.; Radhakrishnan, D.; Freitas, C.","Displaced learners, uprooted because of conflict, poverty, or other major traumas, are often shut out of opportunities to learn engineering. At the same time, fragile contexts demand engineers’ expertise, but experts and their engineered solutions are often called in from outside the community. In this article, we examine engineering learning as a vehicle for development in displaced communities by expanding the representation of engineers to explicitly include refugees and formerly homeless youth. We describe an alternative, co-created approach to providing authentic engineering learning through a framework called Localized Engineering in Displacement. Grounded in principles of critical pedagogy and social justice, this framework is structured to integrate technical content, professional skills, and engineering design, all focused on needs identified by the local students themselves. The Localized framework encompasses the curriculum itself, the collaborative attitudes and humility of partners involved, the prioritization of local engineers’ learning pathways, the pedagogical capacity building of local instructors, and the institutional partnerships required to recognize and implement students’ work. In addition to describing our framework and situating it in the literature, we document two major program outcomes: empowered identity and community impact. Refugee learners and former street youth in the community develop their self-image as engineers, especially after being in positions of low levels of agency or control over their lives. The keystone to the program is our collaboration with local learning spaces (usually in-country implementing NGOs) and community institutions to invest in long-term implementation of solutions. We discuss multiple aspects of community impact, including the engineered products that student members of low-resource communities create, ongoing community teacher development, and collaborative research. © 2022, Advances in Engineering Education.

How do peer support workers value self-directed growth over conventional change goals among young people experiencing homelessness?,"Erangey, J.; Marvin, C.; Littman, D.M.; Bender, K.; Mollica, M.; Milligan, T.; Lucas, T.","The aim of this study is to explore how peer support workers (individuals with similar lived experiences employed to provide support) conceptualize change work with young people experiencing homelessness. The present study used participatory qualitative methods, including semistructured interviews and journaling with peer support workers and program supervisors and administrators, to understand how peers understand change work with young people experiencing homelessness. This study found that peers center self-directed growth among young people experiencing homelessness, rather than change that prioritizes meeting program-directed outcomes such as obtaining housing or gaining employment. Peer relationships invite possibility and create containers of hope when supporting young people experiencing homelessness, regardless of their paths. Lastly, peers recognize that growth happens in seasons, and embrace such seasons as checkpoints on youths' journeys. Such findings may guide service providers beginning peer programming or those considering models for engaging young people experiencing homelessness in relationship-supported growth. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,,J.

LEAVING CARE in QUEBEC: The EDJEP LONGITUDINAL STUDY,"Goyette, M.; Blanchet, A.","This article reports results from the first longitudinal and representative study of a cohort of youth leaving care in Quebec (EDJeP study). Focusing on education and residential stability, we show that youths from youth protection services accumulate important vulnerabilities that make their transition out of youth protection services very challenging. In particular, compared to their peers in the general population, youth leaving care have significant educational delays that complicate their integration into the labor market. Our data suggest that a system that better encourages school perseverance and success would limit these academic delays and promote graduation. We also find that nearly half of the youths from the protection system experienced residential instability in the months following their release from placement and that 20% of them experienced at least one episode of homelessness. These last elements clearly show the extent of the vulnerability of youth leaving the protection system. We suggest some areas of reflection to improve this situation. © 2022 Sociedad Iberoamericana de PedagogÃ­a Social. All rights reserved.",2022,,Pedagog.

Desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness: an exploratory descriptive study,"Mohd Rom, N.A.; Md Hassan, N.; Abu Said, A.-M.; Bachik, B.","Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose - The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques.  The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals.  Findings - It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations - This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city.

Exploring patient-provider interactions and the health system’s responsiveness to street-connected children and youth in Kenya: a qualitative study,"Lonnie, E.; Pooja, S.; Allison, G.; Reuben, K.; David, A.; Juddy, W.; Edith, A.; Paula, B.","Background: In Kenya, street-connected children and youth (SCY) have poor health outcomes and die prematurely due to preventable causes. This suggests they are not accessing or receiving adequately responsive healthcare to prevent morbidity and mortality. We sought to gain insight into the health systems responsiveness to SCY in Kenya through an in-depth exploration of SCY’s and healthcare provider’s reflections on their interactions with each other. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted across 5 counties in western Kenya between May 2017 and September 2018 using multiple methods to explore and describe the public perceptions of, and proposed and existing responses to, the phenomenon of SCY in Kenya. The present analysis focuses on a subset of data from focus group discussions and in-depth interviews concerning the delivery of healthcare to SCY, interactions between SCY and providers, and SCY’s experiences in the health system. We conducted a thematic analysis situated in a conceptual framework for health systems responsiveness. Results: Through three themes, context, negative patient-provider interactions, and positive patient-provider interactions, we identified factors that shape health systems responsiveness to SCY in Kenya. Economic factors influenced and limited SCY’s interactions with the health system and shaped their experiences of dignity, quality of basic amenities, choice of provider, and prompt attention. The stigmatization and discrimination of SCY, a sociological process shaped by the social-cultural context in Kenya, resulted in experiences of indignity and a lack of prompt attention when interacting with the health system. Patient-provider interactions were highly influenced by healthcare providers’ adverse personal emotions and attitudes towards SCY, resulting in negative interactions and a lack of health systems responsiveness. Conclusions: This study suggests that the health system in Kenya is inadequately responsive to SCY. Increasing public health expenditures and expanding universal health coverage may begin to address economic factors, such as the inability to pay for care, which influence SCY’s experiences of choice of provider, prompt attention, and dignity. The deeply embedded adverse emotional responses expressed by providers about SCY, associated with the socially constructed stigmatization of this population, need to be addressed to improve patient-provider interactions. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,BMC Health Serv.

MYPATH: A novel mindfulness and yoga-based peer leader intervention to prevent violence among youth experiencing homelessness,"Barr, N.; Petering, R.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Thompson, N.; Polsky, R.","Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) are at elevated risk for violence victimization and perpetration. However, there are no evidence-based violence prevention interventions for homeless populations. This study is an evaluation of a novel mindfulness-based peer-leader intervention designed to reduce violence and improve mindfulness in YAEH. A social network of YAEH receiving services at a drop-in agency was recruited in Summer 2018 (n = 106) and peer-leaders identified at baseline (n = 12). Peer leaders were trained in mindfulness and yoga skills during a 1-day intensive workshop and seven 1-h weekly follow-up workshops and encouraged to share their knowledge with in-network peers. Postintervention data were collected 2 and 3 months after baseline. Two one-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tested differences in means for mindfulness and fighting. ANOVA models showed significant increases in group mean mindfulness F(2, 110) = 3.42, p < 0.05 and significant decreases in group mean violent behavior F(2, 112) = 5.23, p < 0.01 at the network level. Findings indicate a network-based, peer-leader model can be effective for influencing complex, socially conditioned attitudes and behaviors among YAEH. Additional advantages of the peer-leader model include relatively few direct-service person-hours required from providers and convenience to participants able practice skills in their relevant social contexts. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,,J.

"High-intensity cannabis use and hospitalization: a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada","Reddon, H.; Milloy, M.-J.; Wood, E.; Nosova, E.; Kerr, T.; DeBeck, K.","Background: There is concern that cannabis use negatively affects vulnerable groups such as youth; however, the relationship between cannabis use and health care utilization has not been well characterized in this population. We longitudinally evaluated the association between daily cannabis use and hospitalization among a prospective cohort of street-involved youth. Methods: Data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) in Vancouver, Canada, from September 2005 to May 2015. Participants were interviewed semi-annually and multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between daily cannabis use and hospitalization. Results: A total of 1216 participants (31.2% female) were included in this analysis, and 373 (30.7%) individuals reported hospitalization at some point during the study period. In a multivariable GEE analysis, daily cannabis use was not significantly associated with hospitalization (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.17, 95% Confidence interval [CI] = 0.84, 1.65). We did observe a significant interaction between daily cannabis use and sex (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.77), whereby cannabis use was associated with a decreased odds of hospitalization among males (AOR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.78), yet was not significantly associated with hospitalization among females (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.84, 1.67). Conclusions: The finding that daily cannabis use was not associated with hospitalization among street-involved youth is encouraging given the high rates of cannabis use in this population and the expansion of cannabis legalization and regulation.

“You Start with the Youth”: Narratives of Deservingness and Dissent at a Homeless Service Organization,"Yarbrough, D.","As they provide social services to people experiencing poverty and homelessness, many nonprofit organizations perpetuate ideologies that obscure the political and economic causes of poverty and blame poor people for their plight. But the ideologies and practices of service provision are more diverse than many scholars of the nonprofit industry have assumed. What are the processes by which professionalized service organizations not tied to broader social movements might nonetheless facilitate rather than hinder structural explanations of inequality among their clients? Using ethnographic observation, in-depth interviews, and analysis of art and writing by young adults experiencing homelessness, I investigate the prevalence of structural explanations of poverty among clients at a large homeless youth service organization. I find that the organization’s liberal assimilationist narratives about “youth” facilitate more critical analyses of poverty and inequality among homeless participants. As the organization’s public-facing communications emphasize the positive meanings of youth to assert clients’ deservingness, homeless clients leverage the organization’s assimilationist discourse to advance more radical critiques of the systems that oppress them. Building on scholarship about the medicalization of homelessness and the nonprofit industrial complex, this case study demonstrates how multiple ideologies and practices spanning the continuum from repressive to mobilizing can take hold within a single organization, and by extension, the nonprofit service industry. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,,Sociol.

However, deficit approaches may lead young people to becoming dependent on services and face greater marginalization and stigmatization. Meeting long-standing calls to focus more on young people's positive attributes and abilities, the My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) program was developed as a community partnership with a large housing service. This paper describes the rationale, logic model, and content of the MST4Life™ program using the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist. MST4Life™ is a strengths-based and experiential psychoeducation intervention for young people aged 16–24 years who are homeless or at risk. Grounded in positive youth development and basic psychological needs theory, its aim is to provide meaningful opportunities for participants to recognize, use, and further develop their mental skills and strengths. In turn, enhancing intentional self-regulation is expected to improve physical, mental, and social health and wellbeing, and support positive transitions to independent living.

Capturing the heterogeneity of life on the streets: A person-centered analysis of street histories and social connections of youth,"Lima, R.F.F.; Raffaelli, M.; Morais, N.A.D.; Santana, J.P.; Koller, S.H.","Introduction: The heterogeneity of street-involved youth was examined using a person-centered approach. Youth were classified based on patterns of street involvement and the identified profiles compared to identify theoretically coherent and practically significant differences. Methods: Participants were 111 street-involved youth aged 9 to 18 (M age = 14.15 years; 81.1% male, 91.1% non-white) from three Brazilian cities. Youth completed a life history interview and structured assessment. Latent class analysis was used to identify three profiles of youth based on reasons for going to the street and connections to major developmental contexts (street, family, institutions). Profile comparisons on psychosocial variables (e.g., age, life events) and adjustment indicators (e.g., drug use, life satisfaction) were conducted using multinomial logistic regression. Results: The largest profile (48.6%) included youth drawn to the street by drug use or trafficking, who had moderate connections to street and family. Another group (40.5%) went to the street to escape family dysfunction, and the street represented their primary developmental context. These groups differed on some psychosocial indicators but had similar patterns of adjustment. The third group of youth (10.8%) had families with a history of street involvement and maintained strong ties to all three developmental contexts. These youth had generally better adjustment than their peers (e.g., less drug use, higher life satisfaction) but had higher levels of sexual risk related to the overrepresentation of girls. Conclusions: Street involvement is a multidetermined phenomenon that may expose young people to distinct conditions of vulnerability. Findings have implications for research, practice, and policy. © 2021 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents",2021,,J.

Social-Structural Predictors of Fentanyl Exposure among Street Involved Youth,"Douglas, S.; Hayashi, K.; Richardson, L.; DeBeck, K.; Kerr, T.","ObjectiveThe emergence of synthetic fentanyl has been a main contributor to North America’s rising overdose death rates. While increasing attention has been given to drug-related harm among youth, little is known about how social-structural conditions influence their risk of fentanyl exposure. Therefore, we evaluated potential relationships between social-structural conditions and fentanyl exposure among youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, BC. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort study. The ARYS cohort involves street-involved youth, who use illicit substances in Vancouver, Canada. A multivariable logic regression analysis model was used to identify social factors associated with recent fentanyl exposure as determined through urine drug screening. Results: Overall, 423 participants were included in this analysis, with 380 (38.23%) testing positive for recent fentanyl exposure. In a multivariable relative risk analysis, living in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside in the last six months (RR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03-1.32) and daily heroin injection drug use (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.15 − 1.50) were positively associated with fentanyl exposure. As a secondary measure, we found that within the encounters who denied using fentanyl (92.25% of total encounters), 321 (35.05%) still tested positive. Conclusions: We found that youth residing in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside was positively associated with being exposed to fentanyl. Our findings highlight the need to support youth in finding secure housing outside of Vancouver’s drug use epicenter to reduce fentanyl exposure. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2022,,Subst.

ABES data were used to estimate the prevalence of disruptions and adverse experiences during the pandemic, including parental and personal job loss, homelessness, hunger, emotional or physical abuse by a parent or other adult at home, receipt of telemedicine, and difficulty completing schoolwork. Prevalence estimates are presented for all students and by sex, race and ethnicity, grade, sexual identity, and difficulty completing schoolwork. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than half of students found it more difficult to complete their schoolwork (66%) and experienced emotional abuse by a parent or other adult in their home (55%). Prevalence of emotional and physical abuse by a parent or other adult in the home was highest among students who identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (74% emotional abuse and 20% physical abuse) and those who identified as other or questioning (76% and 13%) compared with students who identified as heterosexual (50% and 10%). Overall, students experienced insecurity via parental job loss (29%), personal job loss (22%), and hunger (24%). Disparities by sex and by race and ethnicity also were noted. Understanding health disparities and student disruptions and adverse experiences as interconnected problems can inform school and community initiatives that promote adolescent health and well-being. With community support to provide coordinated, cross-sector programming, schools can facilitate linkages to services that help students address the adverse experiences that they faced during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Public health and health care professionals, communities, schools, families, and adolescents can use these findings to better understand how students' lives have been affected during the pandemic and what challenges need to be addressed to promote adolescent health and well-being during and after the pandemic.",2022,,MMWR Suppl,71,3,28-34,,10.15585/mmwr.su7103a5,,#1048,Krause 2022,,
Health and Healthcare Service Use: The Experiences of Runaway Trans Adolescents Compared to their Peers,"Ferguson, M.; Peled, M.; Saewyc, E.M.","This study is the first trans-inclusive exploration of the relation between running away from home, health, and access to healthcare and supportive figures as a function of gender among adolescents. Secondary data analysis of the 2013 BC Adolescent Health Survey found that trans adolescents were 4.25 times as likely as males, and 3.0 times as likely as females, to have run away. Logistic regressions indicated that runaway adolescents of all genders had greater odds of reporting poor or fair overall health (OR: 2.9) and mental health (OR: 4.5), and of foregoing needed physical (OR: 4.8) and mental health care (OR: 4.5) compared to adolescents who had not run away. The relation between running away and health was exacerbated among trans adolescents. Trans and female youth were also less likely than males to report receiving helpful support.

Youth without Housing: An Ecological-Developmental Perspective,"Dashora, P.; Kiaras, S.","The current study examined the perspectives of homeless youth on their life experiences using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological-developmental framework. Fifteen youth (18-24 years) were recruited from the streets and homeless serving agencies in a mid-western city in the US. They participated in a life history interview that covered topics including the lived experiences of youth with their family, school, friends, and children’s services, daily struggles, resources, personal strengths, and future hopes.

Childhood during the Holodomor 1932–1933 in Ukraine (in the South of Ukraine),"Kuzovova, N.","The article examines how the Great Famine 1932–1933 in Ukraine (Holodomor), which took more than 3.8 million (according to other estimates—6–8 million) innocent lives, affected the lives of children, adolescents, and youth. Ukrainian families were forced to choose survival strategies in extreme conditions. These strategies rarely considered the interests of children who lost financial support as their parents were arrested, exiled, or dead. As a result, children became homeless or even fell victim to cannibalism. Nevertheless, most of the children received parental care and support as parents made every effort to keep the family together. © 2021 The Author(s).",2022,,J. Fam.

Preventing Indigenous youth homelessness in Canada: A qualitative study on structural challenges and upstream prevention in education,"Ansloos, J.P.; Wager, A.C.; Dunn, N.S.","Drawing on a partnership with a group of Indigenous youth experiencing homelessness in Vancouver, Canada, this study identifies four structural challenges that have impacted them and four actionable upstream strategies to further prevent youth housing precarity. As a secondary analysis of a community-engaged study with youth experiencing homelessness, we conducted a thematic analysis with qualitative data, which included qualitative interviews with five young people and researcher observations. The results reflect the racial, colonial, and economic concerns that impact Indigenous youth experiencing homelessness. The four actionable upstream solutions highlight human rights-based approaches to homelessness, ranging from advancing and strengthening public services, transitional justice processes, and cultural and socioeconomic safety.

Suicidality in homeless children and adolescents: A systematic review,"Flach, Y.; Razza, T.S.","Suicide has been found to be the leading cause of death in the homeless youth population. Mortality rates due to suicide in this cohort can be 12–40 times more elevated than those observed in the general population. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to investigate potential factors associated with suicidality among homeless children and adolescents. After a thorough investigation of peer-reviewed articles from main databases in this literature (ProQuest and EBSCO), a final number of 94 articles were studied to produce the contents of this systematic review. Factors associated with suicidality were divided into two main categories, namely risk factors and protective factors. The results of this review revealed significant risk factors including gender, sexual orientation, history of abuse, mental health diagnoses, negative coping styles, duration of homelessness, and survival sex. Conversely, this review identified protective factors associated with suicidality among homeless children and adolescents, such as the role of resilience, positive coping strategies, and supportive school environment. Given the impact of suicide rates in this already at-risk population, understanding these factors becomes paramount knowledge related to long-term outcomes for the homeless youth population. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Aggression Violent Behav.,64,,,,10.1016/j.avb.2021.101575,,#1055,Flach 2022,,

Street children are subject to violence, a lack of health care, and a lack of education. Which denies them the right to live in a secure environment and exposes them to different health problems. Currently, little is known about the prevalence of Streetism, including health conditions. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the health status of street children and determinants of Streetism. Methods Mixed methods (sequential) were employed from February 1 to 28, 2021. Quantitative cross-sectional study design and phenomenological qualitative designs were applied. Overall, 220 street children were involved in the study. The most common reason that forced the children to resort to a street way of life is to look for a job and quarreled with parents. The data were collected using interviews methods. Chi-square test and multiple binary logistic regression were applied to examine the variations among variables with the health status of street children. Qualitative data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique. Results The study included a total of 220 street children. As to the quantitative study, the majority of study participants (92.73%) drank alcohol regularly. Depression (39.22%) and peer pressure (43.14%) were the most common initiation causes of drinking alcohol. According to a qualitative study report, ""Street children are mostly affected by the communicable disease""and. . . They are addicted to substances like benzene""which had a profound effect on their health.""Furthermore, the study discovered a statistically significant association between respondents' health status and sociodemographic characteristics (age and educational status), job presence, and drug use. Conclusion This study identified the factors that drove street children to live on the streets, such as the inability to find work and disagreements with their parents. The majority of the street children were affected by preventable and treatable diseases. Unfortunately, almost all street children reported drinking alcohol, which exposed them to a variety of health problems. In general, the study discovered that street children require immediate attention. Decision-makers and academicians should collaborate to develop a plan for these children's health and social interventions.  © 2022 Abate et al.

The mediating role of social support in the relationship between stigma and emotional distress among homeless adolescents in Ghana,"Oppong Asante, K.; Onyeaka, H.","Research on youth homelessness has showed a link between emotional distress and social stigma. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship have received little empirical attention. This study was conducted to examine the mediating effect of social support that accounts for the link. Standard questionnaires that assessed emotional distress, stigma and social support were interviewer-administered to 193 homeless adolescents (50.4% male; Mean = 13.21 (SD = 2.06). The Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient and mediation analyses were used to analyse the data. The study revealed that both self-blame and general stigma were positively related to emotional distress; but negatively related to social support. In the mediation analysis, general stigma significantly predicted decreased perceived social support and had a direct positive influence on emotional problems. However, the levels of self-blame was neither significantly associated with perceived social support nor had a significant indirect influence on the level of emotional problems. Both self-blame and general stigma also did not have a significant indirect influence on the level of emotional problems through perceived social support. These findings call for further research to examine the complex mechanism underlying stigma and mental health outcomes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,,Psychol.

Health and adverse childhood experiences among homeless youth,"Barnes, A.J.; Gower, A.L.; Sajady, M.; Lingras, K.A.","Background: Homelessness is associated with health problems and with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The risk of chronic health conditions for homeless compared to housed youth, and how this risk interacts with ACEs remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship between ACEs, housing, and child health, and whether: 1) ACEs and health vary by housing context; 2) ACEs and homelessness confer independent health risks; and 3) ACEs interact with housing with regard to adolescent health. Methods: Using data from 119,254 8th–11th graders, we tested independent and joint effects of ACEs and past-year housing status (housed, family homelessness, unaccompanied homelessness) on overall health and chronic health conditions, controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Results: The prevalence of ACEs varied by housing status, with 34.1% of housed youth experiencing ≥1 ACE vs. 56.3% of family-homeless and 85.5% of unaccompanied-homeless youth. Health status varied similarly. Homelessness and ACEs were independently associated with low overall health and chronic health conditions, after adjusting for covariates. Compared to housed youth, both family-homeless youth and unaccompanied-homeless youth had increased odds of low overall health and chronic physical and/or mental health conditions. All ACE x housing-status interactions were significant (all p < 0.001), such that ACE-related health risks were moderated by housing status. Conclusions: ACEs and housing status independently predict health status during adolescence beyond other sociodemographic risks. Experiencing homelessness, whether unaccomapnied or with family, is associated with increased health risk, and every additional ACE increases this risk. Clinicians and health systems should advocate for policies that include stable housing as a protective factor. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,BMC Pediatr.,21,1,,,10.1186/s12887-021-02620-4,,#1063,Barnes 2021,,
"Utilisation of sexual and reproductive health services among street children and young adults in Kampala, Uganda: does migration matter?","Bwambale, M.F.; Bukuluki, P.; Moyer, C.A.; Van den Borne, B.H.W.","Background: While the nexus of migration and health outcomes is well acknowledged, the effect of rural–urban migration on the use of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services has received less attention. We assessed the effect of rural–urban migration on the use of SRH services, while controlling for confounding, and whether there is a difference in the use of SRH services among migrant and non-migrant street children and young adults. Methods: Data were collected from 513 street children and young adults aged 12–24 years, using venue-based time-space sampling (VBTS). We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis using Stata 16.0 to identify factors associated with SRH services use, with rural–urban migration status as the main predictor. Participants were further classified as new migrants (≤ 2 years of stay in city), established migrants (> 2 years of stay in city) or non-migrants (lifelong native street children) with no rural–urban migration history. Results: Overall, 18.13% of the street children and young adults had used contraception/family planning, 58.67% had tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and knew their status and 34.70% had been screened for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Non-migrants were 2.70 times more likely to use SRH services (HIV testing, STI screening and family planning) compared to the migrants (aOR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.23–5.97). Other factors associated with SRH services use among street children and young adults include age (aOR = 4.70, 95% CI 2.87–7.68), schooling status (aOR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.76), knowledge of place of care (aOR = 2.71, 95% CI 1.64–4.46) and access to SRH information (aOR = 3.23, 95% CI 2.00–5.24). Conclusions: SRH services utilisation among migrant street children and young adults is low compared to their non-migrant counterparts and is independently associated with migration status, age, schooling status, knowledge of place of care and access to SRH information. Our findings call for the need to design and implement multi-dimensional interventions to increase the use of SRH services among street children and young adults, while taking into consideration their migration patterns. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,BMC Health Serv.

The purpose of this study was to identify the self-reported experiences and healthcare needs of youth experiencing homelessness as services in the community began to shut down at the beginning of the pandemic. Method: From May through November 2020, qualitative data were obtained by telephone or Facebook messenger from 20 youth (M = 22.4, SD = 2.64 years) who had been enrolled in a longitudinal intervention study. Results: Content analysis of qualitative data yielded 5 categories and 1 overall theme. Categories were resource availability, financial instability, mental health, relationship conflict, and maladaptive coping. The overall theme was multiple losses. Youths lost jobs, means of financial support for self and family, access to social and healthcare services, meaningful and important relationships, and skills and controls over high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse.

This study was conducted using secondary data analysis of a data set collected through participatory action research in a mid-Atlantic state across three school systems. Findings suggest that school staff are largely unaware of their own role in supporting students experiencing homelessness and need further training. Schools need more resources and community connections to support the needs of their students who are facing housing instability.

"Marketized Mentality, Street Codes and Violence","Baron, S.W.","The article examines the recent individual level extensions to Institutional Anomie Theory. It explores if a marketized mentality is important to the development of a violent street code that encourages violence as a method of self-enhancement, as well as a factor directly leading to violence. Further, it investigates if the impact of the marketized mentality on violence is moderated by risk-taking and violent peers. It controls for other important factors associated with violence including physical abuse, homelessness, violent victimization, and social bonds. The research utilizes self-report data from interviews with 400 Canadian homeless youth aged 16–24. Results from the OLS regressions indicated that a marketized mentality, along with risk-taking, violent peers, violent victimization, and social bonds predicted levels of support for the street code. The marketized mentality had a direct effect on violence, as well as an indirect effect through the street code. The effect of marketized mentality on violence was also stronger at higher levels of risk-taking and violent peer association. Physical abuse, violent victimization, risk-taking, and violent peers also had direct effects on violence. The findings suggest that a marketized mentality can be adopted even in economically marginal populations leading to the development of violent strategies to fulfill goals.

Risk and Protective Factors to LGBTQ+ Youth Suicide: A Review of the Literature,"Gorse, M.","LGBTQ+ youth experience higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior than their cisgender, heterosexual peers, and these disparities have created a need for academic exploration of the risk factors and protective factors surrounding LGBTQ+ youth suicide (Taliaferro and Muehlenkamp in Acad Pediatr 17:715–722; Toomey et al. in J Youth Adolesc 48:788–801; Ybarra et al. in: Espelage et al. (eds) Youth suicide and bullying: challenges and strategies for prevention and intervention, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014). This paper reviews the research that has been completed on these topics in the last 10 years. A variety of risk factors have contributed to higher rates of suicidal ideation, attempts, and completion: minority stress, interpersonal constructs, race, transgender identity, partner violence, homelessness, school victimization, and a lack of school support (Joiner in Why people die by suicide, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005; Meyer in Psychol Bull 129:674–697; Mustanski and Liu in Arch Sex Behav 42:437–448; Van Orden et al. in Psychol Rev 117:575–600). Furthermore, a range of protective factors have been connected with lower rates of suicidal ideation and behavior: gender and sexuality alliances, LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum, LGBTQ+ affirming school policies, familial support, peer support, and mental health interventions (Poteat and Rivers in Youth suicide and bullying: challenges and strategies for prevention and intervention, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014; Stone et al. in Suicide Life Threat Behav 45:415–430; Whitaker et al. in J Adolesc Health 58:63–68).

"""I Smoked That Cigarette, and It Calmed Me Down"": A Qualitative Analysis of Intrapersonal, Social, and Environmental Factors Influencing Decisions to Smoke Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness","Patterson, J.G.; Glasser, A.M.; MacIsco, J.M.; Hinton, A.; Wermert, A.; Nemeth, J.M.","Introduction: Approximately 70% of youth experiencing homelessness smoke cigarettes; many try to quit and are interested in formal smoking cessation programs. The purpose of this study was to describe the intrapersonal, social, and environmental contexts associated with the most recent smoking experience among youth experiencing homelessness and (2) identify differences in contextual factors by age and willingness to quit. Methods: Thirty-six youth experiencing homelessness aged 14-24 years and who reported current smoking were recruited from a drop-in center in a Midwestern city. Semi-structured in-person interviews were analyzed to understand smoking behaviors. Results: Two-thirds of participants reported stress and nicotine dependence as primary reasons for smoking, and older youth (aged 18-24 years) reported smoking to de-escalate negative emotions associated with stressful events. For 25% of participants, and especially older youth, smoking was described as part of a routine. Over 80% of participants smoked outside at the homeless drop-in center or the places they lived. Social prompts from drop-in center peers regularly preempted smoking. Younger youth (aged 14-17 years) reported smoking socially while older youth were more likely to smoke alone. Conclusions: For youth experiencing homelessness, smoking is integrated into daily life and is often used to manage stress associated with homelessness and engage socially with homeless peers. Multicomponent interventions to reduce structural stressors specific to homelessness, change social smoking norms (environmental and social context), and address stress management and nicotine dependence (intrapersonal context) are needed to support smoking cessation among youth experiencing homelessness. Implications: Youth experiencing homelessness overwhelmingly described how daily stressors associated with homelessness and nicotine dependence preceded recent smoking. Older youth (aged 18-24 years) also reported smoking as ""routine"", which likely underscores nicotine dependence in this group. Younger youth (aged 14-17 years) described social smoking. Researchers must develop optimized multilevel interventions to support youth experiencing homelessness who want to quit smoking. Interventions directly targeting social determinants of stress (e.g., poverty, housing instability, food insecurity) and linkages to supportive services are needed. Complementary strategies to address stress coping and nicotine dependence (intrapersonal context) and social smoking norms (social and environmental context) are also necessitated.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Missing from the literature is an understanding of street‐involved youth’s educational aspirations. We employed thematic analysis of qualitative data from in‐person interviews with a purposive sample of street‐involved youth (N = 69) residing in one city in Canada, who were partly or fully disengaged from school at the time of the interview. We asked the youth to talk about their opinions of formal education, its importance for young people, whether learning was important for them, and whether they imagined returning to school/continuing with school. We discovered that the majority of youth had a positive view of school/formal education and stated they liked learning new things and recognized the benefits of continuing/completing their education. At the same time, the youth identified material hardship and other barriers to achieving their educational goals.

METHODS: After thorough examination for inclusion criteria, 665 abstracts of peer-reviewed quantitative studies of risk or resilience factors for homelessness among young people (ages 0-25) that included an adequate comparison group (e.g., not homeless) were selected. After abstract and full-text screening, 16 articles were reviewed. A primary prevention framework was used to create an explanatory model for the onset of homelessness using risk and resilience factors. RESULTS: Common risk factors for youth homelessness included difficulties with family, mental health or substance use problems, a history of problem behaviors, a history of foster care, homelessness as a child, and running away. Common protective factors included a supportive family, a college education, and high socioeconomic status. Findings were integrated into a provisional developmental model of youth homelessness risk. Clinical implications of the model for service development are discussed, and a model for monitoring homelessness risk and resilience factors is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Factors affecting homelessness risk among youths and adults differ, with family, foster care, and schooling playing a much more important role among youths. Findings highlight opportunities for youth homelessness prevention strategies and monitoring.",2022,,Psychiatr Serv,73,4,425-438,,10.1176/appi.ps.202000133,,#1085,Grattan 2022,,
A Review of the Grey Literature on Education-Centred Wraparound Services to Support Students with Complex Support Needs in Australia,"Strnadová, I.; Cumming, T.M.; Lee, H.M.","The aim of this research project was to examine how wraparound supports are represented in the Australian national and NSW state polices and schools and to identify best practices and models of wraparound support. The grey literature from seven sectors, i.e., youth justice, out of home care, disability, mental health, drug and alcohol, homelessness and education was searched and analysed. There is no consensus on a definition or understanding of wraparound across the sectors, the effectiveness of wraparound models is rarely assessed, and schools are not typically included in the wraparound teams of the other sectors. © 2021 James Nicholas Publishers.",2021,,Educ.

We used a 'pop-up' delivery model to bring community-based services in contact with communities with poor access to health and social care. Our aim was to examine whether pop-up events improve access to essential health and social support services for selected vulnerable communities and increase collaboration between community-based health and social services. Set in south-eastern Melbourne, two pop-up events were held, one with people at risk of homelessness attending a community lunch and the other with South Sudanese women helping at-risk youth. Providers represented 20 dental, housing, justice, employment and mental health services. We made structured observations of each event and held semi-structured interviews with consumers and providers. Pre-post surveys of managers assessed acceptability and perceived impact. We reached 100 community participants who had multiple needs, particularly for dentistry. Following the events, participants reported increased knowledge of services and access pathways, community members spoke of increased trust and partnerships between service providers were fostered. The pop-up model can increase provider collaboration and provide new options for vulnerable populations to access needed services.

Extrapolated data included definitions of homelessness, mortality data sources, findings on mortality rates, and causes of premature mortality. Results demonstrate that individuals experiencing homelessness die earlier than comparison groups not experiencing homelessness. Methodology and findings varied across studies. Subpopulations included veterans, families, youth, and unsheltered. Causes of death varied across subpopulations and changed over time. Top causes of death, predominantly determined by ICD codes, stemmed from neoplasms, heart disease, and substance use disorder. Sources used for mortality data included the National Death Index (NDI), the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), state death occurrence files, and city vital statistics.

"Street youths: reproductive health risk status, reproductive health challenges and barriers to health services utilization in a southwestern City, Nigeria","Olugbenga-Bello, A.I.; Ilori, O.R.; Idowu, T.","Background Information: According to the United Nations, about 150 million youth spent most of their time on the street, or better still, homeless. This is becoming a global phenomenon and majority of this vulnerable people live in large cities and urban areas of developing countries. Street youths are among the high risk, insecure and vulnerable groups who are often exposedto various forms of abuses and diseases, including reproductive health issues. Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional study carried out among street youths in Ikorodu Local Government, Lagos State using a multi staged sampling technique. Frequency tables were drawn at the univariate level, chi squared was used to test for association between socio-demographic characteristics and sexual risk level. Data was analyzed using SPPSS version 22, p value was set at 0.05 Results: Almost half 48(48.5%) of the respondents were between the age range 20-24years and two third 61(61.6%) of them were female and 27(27.3%) had up to senior secondary education attainments. Majority 73(73.7%) of them have been on the street for more than 3months and 32 (32.3%) professed that the reason they were on the street was to search for job while 25 (25.3%) because of family disharmony among parents. Eighty six (86.9%) of the respondents were sexually active, 31 (36.0%) of which have more than four sexual partners. Duration of stay on the street and their educational status were determinants of risky sexual behavior and polygamous setting was found to be statistically significant(p value =0.035) with reproductive health challenges. Conclusion: There is high risk sexual practice among street youths in Ikorodu Local Government. Strategic interventions aimed at minimizing sexual risky behaviors among street youths should focus on reducing the duration of stay on the street as well as increasing access to contraception. © 2022, Makerere University, Medical School.

"Emergency department utilisation by homeless children in Dublin, Ireland: A retrospective review","O'Brien, N.; Quinn, N.; Joyce, B.; Bedford, H.; Crushell, E.","Introduction Despite increasing prevalence, European family homelessness remains under-researched. Methods A retrospective review was performed of homeless children attending a paediatric emergency department in Dublin, Ireland, from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020. Comparison was made with a random cohort of 1500 non-homeless paediatric attendances in 2019. Homelessness was defined using the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion, including those with addresses of no fixed abode, government homeless accommodation and certain residential settings. The objectives were to compare presentations between homeless and non-homeless children. We were interested in determining differences regarding demographics, healthcare utilisation, clinical presentation and outcomes. Results Of 197 437 attendances 3138 (1.59%) were homeless. Compared with the non homeless, homeless children were less likely to be ethnically Irish (37.4% vs 74.6%, p<0.001) or have been born in Ireland (82.3% vs 96.2%, p<0.001). Irish Travellers (3% vs 0.8%), Roma (22.5% vs 2.4%) and black (21.1% vs 4.2%) ethnicities were over-represented (p<0.001) in the homeless cohort. Homeless children were younger (age <12 months: 26% vs 16%; p<0.001), less likely to be fully vaccinated (73.6% vs 81.9%, p<0.001) and have registered general practitioners (89.7% vs 95.8%, p<0.001). They were more likely to represent within 2 weeks (15.9% vs 10.5%, p<0.001), and use ambulance transportation (13.2% vs 6.7%, p<0.001). Homeless children had lower acuity presentations (triage category 4-5: 47.2% vs 40.7%, p<0.001) and fewer admissions (5.9% vs 8.4%, p<0.001) than non-homeless children.

Relationship of parent-rated and objectively evaluated executive function to symptoms of posttraumatic stress and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in homeless youth,"Lafavor, T.; Gimbel, B.; Olsen, A.; Travis, A.; Weber, R.","Compared to their stably housed peers, homeless, and highly mobile (HHM) youth experience disproportionately greater adversity and risk leading to a wide variety of poor developmental outcomes, and targeted interventions have the potential to mitigate such outcomes. A growing literature highlights the need for accurate diagnosis in high-risk populations given the considerable overlap between posttraumatic symptomology and behaviorally based disorders such as ADHD. Objective testing inferring neurobiological and circuit-based abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and ADHD may provide a useful clinical tool to aid accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations. This novel, exploratory study examined the relation between executive function (EF) as measured by objective testing and parent ratings with symptoms of posttraumatic stress and ADHD in 86 children (age 9 to 11) living in emergency homeless shelters. Parent-rated EF problems suggested broad impairment associated with ADHD symptoms but specific impairment in emotional/behavioral function associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms. While measures of inhibition and shifting EF were strongly associated with symptomology in bivariate correlations, they explained minimal variance in regression models. Internalizing behavior problems were associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms, while externalizing behavior problems were associated with ADHD symptoms.

Adolescent Antecedents of Young Adult Homelessness: a Cross-national Path Analysis,"Heerde, J.A.; Bailey, J.A.; Toumbourou, J.W.; Rowland, B.; Catalano, R.F.","Adolescent and young adult health, development, and behavior lay a foundation for future population health. Increasing rates of young adult homelessness mean there is a need for research which generates evidence to support a stronger focus on population-level prevention. Using longitudinal data from a population-based sample of young adults participating in the cross-nationally matched International Youth Development Study, we examined adolescent antecedents of young adult homelessness in Washington State in the USA and in Victoria, Australia. Participants were surveyed using a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. Analyses of prospective, longitudinal data from 1945 participants, recruited as state-representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (average age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at young adulthood (average age 25, 2014), showed that young adults in Washington State reported higher rates of past year homelessness (5.24%) compared to those in Victoria (3.25%). Path modeling showed less positive family management strategies at age 13 uniquely increased risk for age 25 homelessness. This effect remained after accounting for age 15 antecedents in peer-group, school, and community environments. Friends’ drug use, school suspension, academic failure, and low neighborhood attachment at age 15 mediated the association between less positive family management strategies at age 13 and age 25 homelessness. Despite observing some cross-national differences in levels of family, peer-group, school, and community antecedents, we found that these factors equally increased risk for age 25 homelessness in both states, suggesting similar cross-national influences for young adult homelessness. The findings indicate cross-nationally common adolescent antecedents for young adult homelessness that could be targeted by prevention strategies across international settings. © 2021, Society for Prevention Research.",2022,,Prev.

Determinants of stunting and wasting in street children in Northwest Ethiopia: A community-based study,"Mulu, N.; Mohammed, B.; Woldie, H.; Shitu, K.","Objective: This study aimed to identify determinant factors of stunting and wasting in street children ages 5 to 18 y in Northwest Ethiopia. Materials and methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. An interviewer-administered, structured, and pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. A convenience sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Stunting and wasting were defined as having a height-for-age and weight-for-height Z score of less than –2 SDs, respectively. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were fitted to identify factors associated with stunting and wasting. A 95% confidence interval (CI) and P < 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. Results: The overall prevalence of stunting and wasting was 46.4% (95% CI: 41.6–51.5%) and 15.3 % (95% CI: 11.7–19.0%), respectively. Age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.47), substance use (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.33, 3.21), and loss of appetite (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.31, 3.04) were independently associated with stunting. Whereas age (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.89), illness (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.48), and open defecation (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.14, 4.51) were factors associated with wasting. Conclusion: Stunting and wasting were found to be critical problems in street children. Age, loss of appetite, and substance use were significantly associated with stunting, whereas child age, illness, and open defecation practice were significantly associated with wasting.

Violence against homeless gay and transgender youth in Pakistan–a short report,"Noor, M.N.","Violence against youth with diverse sexual and gender identities is an understudied area in Pakistan. This article explores how homeless gay and transgener youth (HGTY) experience multiple forms of violence and how social structural conditions produce contexts for violence against them. This study is based on qualitative interviews with fourteen HGTY, aged 16–25 years old. The interviews suggest that participants experienced multiple forms of violence simultaneously. Social structures like religion, ethnicity, and politics shaped broader cultural intolerance for sexual and/or gender diversity. Not being able to conform to social norms of gender and sexuality not only contributed to violence against participants but shaped their trajectories into homelessness and sex work. The ‘new’ identities of being homeless and being sex workers intersected with their gay and, trans identities, exacerbating their vulnerability. The findings indicate that there is an urgent need for law supportive of sexuality and gender diverse youth to mitigate experiences of violence. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,,Vulnerable Child.

Early fatherhood and socioeconomic outcomes among young men transitioning from foster care in the United States,"Shpiegel, S.; Aparicio, E.M.; Smith, R.; Grinnell-Davis, C.; King, B.","Purpose: Early fatherhood among young men transitioning from foster care has received scant research attention. The purpose of the present study was to: (a) examine the rates of fatherhood by age 21 in two distinct samples of youth transitioning from foster care in the United States; and (b) evaluate the impact of fatherhood on youths‘ educational and vocational attainment, and experiences of homelessness and incarceration, at age 21. Methods: We used data from two cohorts of the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), initiated in years 2011 and 2014. The final sample for each cohort consisted of young men who completed a baseline survey at age 17, and two follow up surveys at ages 19 and 21 (N = 2488 and N = 2793, respectively). Data from each NYTD cohort was merged with data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) for years 2011 and 2014. Results: The cumulative rate of fatherhood by age 21 was 19.3% in the 2011 sample, and 16.5% in the 2014 sample. The rates of fatherhood were higher between ages 19–21, as compared to earlier ages. In multivariate analyses, fatherhood was linked to lower educational attainment and higher risk of homelessness and incarceration, but not to employment status. These findings were consistent across both NYTD samples. Conclusions: Fathers represent a sizable group of transitioning foster youth, who may exhibit detrimental outcomes in young adulthood.

Hepatitis A and B vaccination in adults at risk: A survey of US healthcare providers’ attitudes and practices,"Herrera-Restrepo, O.; Davis, K.; Sweeney, C.; Davenport, E.; Ghaswalla, P.; Buck, P.O.","This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes and practices of US healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vaccination recommendations on HepA and HepB for adult patients at risk of contracting these infections or experiencing complications of hepatitis disease. This cross-sectional, web-based survey of 400 US HCPs, which included nurse practitioners and family medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, emergency department, and gastroenterology physicians, assessed HCPs’ attitudes and practices regarding the ACIP recommendations for adult patients at risk for hepatitis disease. HCP participants were identified via a survey research panel. A recruitment quota of 400 HCPs was set, including 50 NPs, 100 FMs, 100 IMs, 50 GIs, 50 EDs, and 50 IDs. The most frequently reported reasons for not recommending either HepA or HepB vaccines were “I think the risk of HepA infection is low in this patient population” and “I am uncertain about what the guidelines say about vaccinating this population.” The most reported factors considered when determining eligibility for either vaccine were medical history and the patient’s willingness/motivation to be vaccinated. Most reported it was extremely or moderately important to prevent hepatitis disease by vaccinating adult patients at risk, and most also reported recommending a HepA vaccine or HepB vaccine to patients at risk. Although most HCPs reported recommending HepA and HepB vaccines to patients at risk, these findings contrast with the low reported vaccination rates among these populations, and improved awareness of the ACIP recommendations among HCPs is needed. © 2022 GSK.

"Illicit Drug Use, Cognitive Distortions, and Suicidal Ideation Among Homeless Youth: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial","Wu, Q.; Zhang, J.; Walsh, L.; Slesnick, N.","Illicit drug use and cognitive distortions confer significant risks to youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, there has been limited evidence regarding the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions with homeless youth, especially studies testing whether such interventions can reduce the risk for suicidal ideation associated with illicit drug use. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their illicit drug use, cognitive distortions, and suicidal ideation 4 times over 9 months. A multiple-group multilevel structural equation model showed that higher illicit drug use at baseline predicted a slower reduction in cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation in the TAU group. These associations were not found in the CTSP + TAU group, suggesting an interruption of such risk from illicit drug use. Findings suggest that CTSP can reduce the risk of illicit drug use as a treatment barrier towards cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality in a vulnerable population. © 2021",2022,,Behav.

"“Prevention of opioid use disorder: the HOME (housing, opportunities, motivation and engagement) feasibility study”","Kelleher, K.J.; Famelia, R.; Yilmazer, T.; Mallory, A.; Ford, J.; Chavez, L.J.; Slesnick, N.","Young adults experiencing homelessness are at high risk of opioid and other substance use, poor mental health outcomes, exposure to trauma, and other risks. Providing access to stable housing has the potential to act as a powerful preventive intervention, but supportive housing programs have been studied most often among chronically homeless adults or adults with serious mental illness. The Housing First model, which does not precondition supportive housing on sobriety, may reduce drug use in homeless adults. In the present study, we piloted an adapted model of Housing First plus prevention services that was tailored to the needs of young adults (18–24 years) experiencing homelessness in the USA. Preventive services were added to the Housing First model and included youth-centered advocacy services, motivational interviewing, and HIV risk prevention services. This model was piloted in a single-arm study (n = 21) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a Housing First model over a 6-month period in preparation for a larger randomized trial. We use repeated measures ANOVA to test for changes in alcohol and drug use (percent days of use; alcohol or drug use consequences), housing stability, social network support, and cognitive distortions over 6 months of follow-up. A total of 17 youth completed the study (85% retention), and a high proportion of youth were stably housed at 6-month follow-up. Participation in intervention services was high with an average of 13.57 sessions for advocacy, 1.33 for MI, and 0.76 for HIV prevention. Alcohol use did not change significantly over time. However, drug use, drug use consequences, and cognitive distortions, and the size of youths’ social networks that were drug using individuals decreased significantly. The Housing First model appeared to be feasible to deliver, and youth engaged in the supportive intervention services.

These serve to motivate behaviour either towards or away from an aspect of self and may be useful in personalising rehabilitation and contributing to maintained sobriety. In this qualitative study, we used a phenomenological design to sample nine participants in a treatment centre in Gauteng, South Africa. These participants engaged in the possible-me-tree-drawing activity to explore their hoped-for, feared and expected possible selves. The findings of hoped-for selves as sober, educated and in healthy relationships were identified. Feared selves included self as a life-long addict, homeless and alone. The participants discussed expected selves as family members and independent. The participants felt that the activity was useful to them. All participants stated that identifying their possible selves would help them to maintain sobriety after leaving the treatment facility. Based on these findings we recommend that possible selves be implemented in treatment programmes for substance use disorder. We also recommend that future research include replicating the study, including a longitudinal component and comparison studies based on a quasi-experimental design. © Unisa Press 2022.",2022,,South.

The association between experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and adult housing stability in Housing First,"Parpouchi, M.; Moniruzzaman, A.; Somers, J.M.","Background: Researchers have pointed out the paucity of research investigating long-term consequences of experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth. Limited research has indicated that the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth is associated with adverse adjustment-related consequences in adulthood. Housing First (HF) has acknowledged effectiveness in improving housing outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness, although some HF clients struggle with maintaining housing. The current study was conducted to examine whether the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth increases the odds of poorer housing stability following entry into high-fidelity HF among adults experiencing serious mental illness and who were formerly homeless. Methods: Data were drawn from the active intervention arms of a HF randomized controlled trial in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Participants (n = 297) were referred to the study from service agencies serving adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness between October 2009 and June 2011. The Residential Time-Line Follow-Back Inventory was used to measure housing stability. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to estimate the association between first experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and later housing stability as an adult in HF. Results: Analyses indicated that homelessness in childhood or youth was negatively associated with experiencing housing stability as an adult in HF (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.31–0.90). Conclusions: Further supports are needed within HF to increase housing stability among adult clients who have experienced homelessness in childhood or youth. Asking clients about the age they first experienced homelessness may be of clinical utility upon enrollment in HF and may help identify support needs related to developmental experiences. Results further emphasize the importance of intervening earlier in life in childhood and youth before experiencing homelessness or before it becomes chronic. Findings also contribute to a limited knowledge base regarding the adverse long-term consequences of childhood and youth homelessness.

"Protocol for a systematic review of policies, programs or interventions designed to improve health and wellbeing of young people leaving the out-of-home care system","Taylor, D.J.A.; Shlonsky, A.; Albers, B.; Chakraborty, S.; Lewis, J.; Mendes, P.; Macdonald, G.; Williams, K.","Background: Relative to their counterparts in the general population, young people who leave, or transition out of, out-of-home (OOHC) arrangements commonly experience poorer outcomes across a range of indicators, including higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, reliance on public assistance, physical and mental health problems and contact with the criminal justice system. The age at which young people transition from OOHC varies between and within some countries, but for most, formal support ceases between the ages of 18 and 21. Programs designed to support transitions are generally available to young people toward the end of their OOHC placement, although some can extend beyond. They often encourage the development of skills required for continued engagement in education, obtaining employment, maintaining housing and general life skills. Little is known about the effectiveness of these programs or of extended care policies that raise the age at which support remains available to young people after leaving OOHC. This systematic review will seek to identify programs and/or interventions that improve outcomes for youth transitioning from the OOHC system into adult living arrangements. Methods: This review will identify programs, interventions and policies that seek to improve health and wellbeing of this population that have been tested using robust controlled methods. Primary outcomes of interest are homelessness, health, education, employment, exposure to violence and risky behaviour. Secondary outcomes are relationships and life skills. We will search, from January 1990 onwards, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment. Grey literature will be identified through searching websites and databases, e.g. clearing houses, government agencies and organisations known to be undertaking or consolidating research on this topic area. Two reviewers will independently screen all title and abstracts and full text articles with conflicts to be resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction will be undertaken by pairs of review authors, with one reviewer checking the results of the other. If more than one study with suitable data can be identified, we plan to undertake both fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses and intend to present the random-effects result if there is no indication of funnel plot asymmetry. Risk of bias will be assessed using tools appropriate to the study methodology. Quality of evidence across studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Discussion: Previous reviews were unable to identify any programs or interventions, backed by methodologically rigorous research, that improve outcomes for this population. This review seeks to update this previous work, taking into account changes in the provision of extended care, which is now available in some jurisdictions.

COVID-19 Vaccination Rates and Attitudes Among Young Adults With Recent Experiences of Homelessness,"Tucker, J.S.; D'Amico, E.J.; Pedersen, E.R.; Garvey, R.; Rodriguez, A.; Klein, D.J.","Purpose: This study provides information on COVID-19 vaccination and attitudes among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness. Methods: Participants (n = 134) from a clinical trial of a risk reduction program for youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles completed survey items about COVID-19 vaccinations between March and October 2021. Results: A total of 29% of respondents were vaccinated, and 50% were not interested in getting vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 58% had not been offered the vaccine; furthermore, 38%–45% had strong distrust of the vaccine and were worried about its harmfulness. Vaccination status was generally unrelated to demographics, housing instability, service use, substance use, or mental health. Discussion: Our data suggest that vaccination rates are lower among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness than those in the general US population. The results suggest a need for greater direct outreach that includes both offering the vaccine and addressing misconceptions about its safety to increase vaccination rates in this population. © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2022,,J.

Prevalence and associated characteristics of youth who trade sex in a representative sample of high school students,"Gerassi, L.B.; Cheng, S.-Y.; Muentner, L.; Benson, M.","Introduction: Our understanding of youths’ sex trading predominantly stems from non-representative studies with high-risk populations (e.g. homeless/runaway youth). The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence and associated characteristics of youth who report sex trading (compared to those who do not) in a representative sample of high school students. Methods: Data comes from the 2018 Youth Assessment, a cross-sectional survey administered to 9th through 12th graders across 24 high schools in Dane County, a predominantly urban area in Wisconsin, U.S.A. All youth who answered the question, “have you ever had sexual contact in order to stay safe or to get something like a place to stay, money, gifts, alcohol or drugs?” were included for secondary data analysis (n = 13,714). Participants were 70% White, 50% female/47% male, and 90% minors. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: 2.47% of youth reported sex trading, of whom 91% were minors. Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences across demographics, economic instability, behavioral health and substance use, delinquency, and romantic/sexual behaviors. Multivariate results suggested that students who reported substance use, cutting class, 3 or more out-of-school suspensions, knowing a friend involved in a gang, dating violence, foster care involvement, or identifying as LGBTQ+ were more likely to report sex trading. Conclusions: Although the causal order of characteristics analyzed in relation to the sex trading is not known, these findings have important implications for sex trading prevention, assessments, and intervention, particularly among youth with marginalized identities and adverse experiences. © 2021 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents",2021,,J.

Opioid Use Disorder and Racial/Ethnic Health Disparities: Prevention and Management,"Siddiqui, N.; Urman, R.D.","Purpose of Review: This review aims to summarize risks and disparities associated with the prevalence and treatment of opioid use disorder in the perioperative and long-term setting, as well as evidence-based treatment and prevention targeted toward specific vulnerable populations. Recent Finding: There are significant demographic disparities in pain management and development and management of OUD in the chronic and surgical setting. While White patients traditionally receive more pain management, they are also at higher risk of developing OUD. Hispanic and Latin populations have the largest proportion of youth with OUD and often lack culturally appropriate translation services that allow for effective treatment. Native Americans have the second highest rate of OUD and often receive care in communities and healthcare settings that lack funding and resources to combat OUD. African Americans tend to suffer from the criminalization of OUD and are less able to seek treatment due to this, and furthermore, often lack community services that would benefit them. Additional vulnerable populations include homeless individuals that lack access to healthcare or health insurance. In addition, incarcerated individuals often lack access to naloxone and suffer from high rates of fatal overdose soon after being released to the community. People in rural settings lack needle-exchange programs and community-based interventions/support groups. Summary: Patients in the perioperative setting lack standard screening and pain management protocols. Interventions targeted toward each appropriate group can help decrease the rate of OUD and improve its treatment, and overarching interventions such as protocols, targeted funding, education and regulation can combat OUD for all populations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Curr.

"Better off alone? Comparing the substance use, mental health and trauma risks of youth alcohol and other drug service users either living in out of home care, living with parents or experiencing homelessness","Hallam, K.T.; Fernandes, M.; Pavlis, A.","Introduction: All young people seeking assistance from youth alcohol and other drug services require support to help them minimise the harms from their substance use and continue to develop healthy and meaningful lives. A particular focus on young people in residential out of home care (OoHC) highlights the increased risks of substance use, mental health issues and continued vulnerabilities in this group. While in the past, research contrasted this group with young people living at home, this study contrasted young people in OoHC with homeless youths alongside those living with parents. Methods: The research contrasted these three groups of young people on substance use profiles, mental health and wellbeing and vulnerability to abuse (historic and current) in the Youth Needs Census conducted in Victoria and Queensland over 2013–2017. Results: The results demonstrate a clear risk of increased casual and daily methamphetamine use in the homeless youth group and occasional heroin use in the OoHC group. Mental health measures for both the OoHC and homeless youths were worse than the young people living at home. Trauma was similarly higher in these groups, with both historical and ongoing risks of violent crime for homeless youths. Discussion and Conclusions: The results demonstrate the similar and serious health and wellbeing risks facing both youths in residential OoHC and homeless youths. These results are concerning as one of these groups is ostensibly in the care of the community and government, while the other group is experiencing unstable accommodation and associated physical risks. © 2021 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.",2022,,Drug Alcohol Rev.,41,2,467-475,,10.1111/dar.13379,,#1154,Hallam 2022,,

Helping Homeless Youth: Epistemological Implications of Power in a YPAR Project,"DeMeulenaere, E.","Text from Nasma: “I’ve started moving my things out of the house. I’m putting it in your office for now.” Thus began the story of how one of the youth I had worked with for four years on various YPAR projects became homeless and turned to me for help. Entering this crisis with Nasma took time and an emotional toll, and it affected the power dynamics of our relationship when finishing our YPAR project. Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) works to rebalance power in inequitable relationships based on roles, age, race, gender, etc. Providing care to Nasma as she confronted the traumatic situation of homelessness affected our collaborative relationship as she became dependent on me for basic economic resources. Through this process, the inequities in age and material resources between Nasma and me were centred, displacing the more equitable interactions that we had constructed through YPAR projects. This article employs critical autoethnography to examine the epistemological ‘risks of care’ and argues that the calls for ‘care-full’ scholarship still need to contend with the pitfalls of differential power dynamics in YPAR. © 2021 by the author(s).",2021,,Gateway.,14,2,,,10.5130/ijcre.v14i2.7773,,#1158,DeMeulenaere 2021,,
A Feasibility Study of the My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) Program for Young People Experiencing Homelessness,"Cumming, J.; Clarke, F.J.; Holland, M.J.G.; Parry, B.J.; Quinton, M.L.; Cooley, S.J.","My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) is a positive youth development program for improving wellbeing and social inclusion in young people experiencing homelessness. MST4Life™ addresses a gap in strengths-based programs aimed at promoting healthy and optimal development in vulnerable older adolescents/emerging adults. The program was co-developed with a UK housing service as part of a long-term (>8 years) community–academic partnership. This mixed-methods study describes a key step in developing and evaluating the program: exploring its feasibility and acceptability with 15 homeless young people (Mean age = 19.99 years, SD = 2.42; 60% male, 40% female). Participants experienced 8 weekly sessions within their local community, followed by a 4-day/3-night residential outdoor adventure trip. In addition to their attendance records, the viewpoints of the participants and their support workers were obtained using diary rooms and focus groups. Feasibility was indicated via the themes of attendance, engagement, and reaction. The findings suggested that young people enjoyed and perceived a need for the program, that they considered the program and its evaluation methods to be acceptable, and that both the community-based and outdoor adventure residential phases could be implemented as planned. Minor modifications are needed to recruitment strategies before it is more widely rolled out and evaluated. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2022,,Int. J. Environ. Res.

HPV Vaccination among Sexual and Gender Minority Youth Living with or at High-Risk for HIV,"Arnold, E.M.; Bridges, S.K.; Goldbeck, C.; Norwood, P.; Swendeman, D.; Rotheram-Borus, M.J.","Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is epidemic among young people, especially those at highest risk of acquiring HPV-related cancers. Methods: Youth aged 14–24 years old (N = 1628) were recruited from 13 clinics, community agencies, and social media sites in Los Angeles, California, and New Orleans, Louisiana, that specialized in serving sexual and gender minority youths (SGMY), especially males at risk for HIV. A cross-sectional comparison of sociodemographic and risk histories of HPV vaccinated/unvaccinated youths was conducted using both univariate and multivariate regressions. Results: About half (51.9%) of youth were vaccinated, with similar percentages across states and across genders. Sexual and gender minority youths (SGMY, i.e., gay, bisexual, transgender, and non-heterosexual; 68.8%) and their heterosexual peers (15%) were equally likely to be vaccinated (54%), even though their risk for HPV-related cancers is very different. Vaccinations were higher among younger youth, those not using condoms, youth with greater education, that possessed a primary health care provider, and youth diagnosed with HIV. Vaccinations were lower among youth that were out-of-home due to mental health inpatient hospitalization, drug treatment, homelessness, or incarceration. Conclusions: Special programs are required to target youth experiencing multiple life stressors, especially out-of-home experiences, those with less education, and without the safety net of health insurance or a provider. © 2022 by the authors.

How Do Youth Use Homeless Shelters?,"Jadidzadeh, A.; Kneebone, R.","This paper uses a large administrative dataset providing 105,149 daily observations on 3,176 youth aged between 18 and 24 years using emergency homeless shelters from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Using k-mean cluster analysis we classify youth who use emergency homeless shelters by their intensity of shelter use. In Calgary, most youth use homeless shelters as a temporary and infrequent refuge when housing is lost. For these youth, shelters are an effective and relatively inexpensive approach for helping them resolve their homelessness. A significant number, however, rely on shelters for much longer stays. For these youth, shelters are ineffective and expensive responses to their homelessness. To understand how youth are changing their use of shelters over time, we introduce time series measuring first admissions and readmissions to shelters. We show that how youth use shelters, and how that use has changed over time, differs for youth who self-identify as Indigenous, Caucasian and visible minority. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Housing, opportunities, motivation and engagement (HOME) for homeless youth at-risk for opioid use disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Slesnick, N.; Chavez, L.; Bunger, A.; Famelia, R.; Ford, J.; Feng, X.; Higgins, S.; Holowacz, E.; Jaderlund, S.; Luthy, E.; Mallory, A.; Martin, J.; Walsh, L.; Yilmazer, T.; Kelleher, K.","Background: Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as “Housing First,” has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. Methods: Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18–24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. Discussion: This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

The youth HIV policy advisors programme: Creating change agents and policy leaders,"Grose, R.G.; Halden Brown, E.; Roth Bayer, C.; Paulk, E.","Background: In 2018, Georgia ranked fourth in the USA for the number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and first for rate of new HIV diagnoses. Structural barriers to HIV prevention and care include homelessness, inadequate access to healthcare, insufficient sexual health education, HIV criminalisation and incarceration. Objective: Georgia Equality created the Youth HIV Policy Advisors (YHPA) Programme in 2015 to increase the meaningful involvement of young PLWHA in health policy and leadership. Design, setting and method: The YHPA Programme trains young PLWHA in the structural and social determinants of HIV risk and imparts HIV policy advocacy knowledge and skills. The programme typically involves weekend training events held between June and December, the creation of a policy agenda, and facilitation of a culminating World AIDS Day event. We conducted a mixed-methods survey of 29 alumni (91%) to understand programme engagement, benefits and skills gained. Results: Quantitative results showed average gains of 1.4 in HIV-related skills and 2.4 in policy-related skills (6-point scales). Qualitative analysis revealed important increases in knowledge and skills, self-awareness, social capital, political connections and social support that equipped youth to become change agents. Conclusion: Policy advocacy and leadership programmes are a unique and important mechanism to promote the meaningful involvement of young PLWHA in critical decisions about the structural changes necessary to end the epidemic. YHPA alumni engagement in future integrated strategies to address HIV prevention and care is essential. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,Health Educ.

"Theorizing a Social Ecology of Displacement: Structural-, Relational-, and Individual-Level Conditions of Homelessness among Young People","Miranda Samuels, G.E.; Curry, S.R.; Cerven, C.","abs t ract Every year 4.2 million young people in America experience some form of homelessness. The observation that homelessness has a complex etiology spanning structural, relational, and individual levels of influence is not novel. However, few studies have empirically demonstrated how conditions across these levels collectively shape a distinct social ecology of homelessness, particularly for youth. Using critical realism and the extended case method, we analyze in-depth interviews with 215 young people. Our findings suggest a social ecology of displacement prior to and during homelessness. Findings complement ecological perspectives on homelessness among youth but support a more dynamic, interdependent, and bidirectional theorizing of its causes and consequences. We propose a conceptual model illustrating these processes and call for critical placemaking as a much-needed, relationally just praxis with young people. © 2021 The University of Chicago.

Housing First Combined with Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention (HOME + STEP): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Chavez, L.; Kelleher, K.; Bunger, A.; Brackenoff, B.; Famelia, R.; Ford, J.; Feng, X.; Mallory, A.; Martin, J.; Sheftall, A.; Walsh, L.; Yilmazer, T.; Slesnick, N.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation. Methods: Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (n = 120), or supportive services alone (n = 120). The “Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention” (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W ≥ 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants. Discussion: The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth.

Using the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS), this study seeks to explore the associations of having a parent, family member, friend, or romantic partner in one’s social network and not being “out” to specific network members (lack of disclosure) with ITS constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging), considering homelessness history. Data include 462 youth aged 12–24 who contacted an LGBTQ youth-focused suicide crisis provider from 2015 to 2017. Disclosure status and network composition differed by homelessness experience. Homeless youth were more likely to disclose to their parents and less likely to disclose to other family members. Youth who had not disclosed to their parents reported higher perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging whereas having more family members and peers in one’s network was associated with lower scores on ITS constructs.

Pilot data were collected on 85 homeless emerging adults in New York City recruited at drop-in centers and residential shelters. Quantitative results show the majority of the sample (81%) experienced at least one instance of homelessness discrimination in the past year. Over half the sample felt like others treated them as mentally inferior because of their homelessness, labeling them as crazy, irresponsible, and lazy. Additionally, nearly a third felt like they were ignored and/or treated unfairly by police officers and service providers. Qualitative data are used to supplement these results by detailing specific discriminatory experiences. Written responses about specific incidents reveal that youth feel dehumanized by friends and family as well as service providers and random people based on their homelessness.

Integrating substance use care into primary care for adolescents and young adults: Lessons learned,"Bagley, S.M.; Hadland, S.E.; Schoenberger, S.F.; Gai, M.J.; Topp, D.; Hallett, E.; Ashe, E.; Samet, J.H.; Walley, A.Y.","Background: Substance use disorders are common chronic conditions that often begin and develop during adolescence and young adulthood, yet the delivery of primary care is not developmentally tailored for youth who use substances. Very few primary care–based substance use treatment programs exist in the United States for adolescents and young adults and no clear guidance is available about how to provide substance use treatment in primary care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective evaluation from July 2016 to December 2018 of a newly established primary care–based, multidisciplinary, outpatient program for youth who use substances. Components of the program include primary care, addiction treatment, harm reduction, naloxone distribution, psychotherapy, recovery support, and navigation addressing social determinants of health. We report the following patient characteristics and outcomes: demographics; proportion with substance use and mental health diagnoses; receipt of medications for opioid use disorder; retention in care at three, six, nine, and 12 months; and re-engagement in medical care. Results: From July 2016 through December 2018, 148 patients had at least one visit. Demographic characteristics included: median age 21 years; 40.5% female; 94.0% spoke primarily English; 18.3% Black, 14.9% Hispanic, and 60.8% white. One-third of patients (33.8%) were homeless or housing insecure. The most common substance use disorder was opioid use disorder (60.8%), followed by nicotine (37.2%), cannabis (20.9%), and alcohol (18.2%). Overall, 29.7% of patients had depression, 32.4% had anxiety disorder, and 18.9% had post-traumatic stress disorder. Retention in care was 29.7% at six months and 12.2% at 12 months. Among the 90 patients with OUD, 90.0% received medication for OUD, and 35.5% and 15.5% of patients with OUD were retained at six and 12 months, respectively. For patients lost to follow-up (no contact during a three-month period), the median time to re-engagement was 4.8 months, and 33.3% (37/111) of patients re-engaged. The most common reason for re-engagement was to access mental health treatment (59.5%) and primary care (51.4%). Conclusions: Youth who sought care in a primary care–based substance use program presented most commonly with opioid, nicotine, cannabis, and alcohol use disorders. Co-morbid mental health diagnoses were common. While continuous retention at 12 months was low, one in three of the patients who fell out of care re-engaged. For youth receiving substance use care integrated into primary care, key components for pursing optimal retention in substance use treatment are a flexible model that anticipates the need for the treatment of mental health disorders and the use of re-engagement strategies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,,J.

Voter registration and voting attitudes of unhoused young adults in Los Angeles,"Petering, R.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Hsu, H.-T.; Alessandra, J.; Chinen, N.; Medhekar, S.","Historically, the United States has had a low voter turnout. This is evident with young adults, especially those who are experiencing homelessness. To understand how this unique subpopulation views voting, we conducted a research study that surveyed 79 unhoused young adults (18–26 years old) in Los Angeles. Our results indicated that of those eligible to vote, 56% identified as being currently registered. When asked if they were planning to vote in the November election, only 37% of those eligible to vote said yes. Young people identifying as LGBQ were significantly more likely to be registered as well as 4.5 times more likely to have a plan to vote. When participants were asked why they would not vote, reasons generally fell into four themes: apathy or confusion about the process, the perception of voting of having no change or impact, persistence of injustice, or active rejection of voting. Therefore, we suggest three policy recommendations to increase voter turnout among young adults experiencing homelessness: (1) encouraging voter registration and implementing targeted voter campaigns for young adults; (2) closing the gap in education and outreach, particularly at the local level; and (3) including unhoused individuals in local government and policy making decisions. These recommendations would encourage youth who are experiencing homelessness to vote, thus closing the gap and increasing voter turnout. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child. Youth Serv.

Comparing substance use and mental health among sexual and gender minority and heterosexual cisgender youth experiencing homelessness,"Hao, J.; Beld, M.; Khoddam-Khorasani, L.; Flentje, A.; Kersey, E.; Mousseau, H.; Frank, J.; Leonard, A.; Kevany, S.; Dawson-Rose, C.","Youth homelessness has been demonstrated to disproportionately affect sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth compared to heterosexual cisgender peers. In this context, we aimed to compare health risks between service-seeking SGM and heterosexual cisgender youth experiencing homelessness, including harmful risks stemming from substance use and severity of symptoms of mental health disorders. We recruited 100 racially diverse, unstably housed participants aged 18–24 who access services at an urban non-profit organization in San Francisco, CA. Data analysis included 56 SGM participants who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, unsure, transgender, and nongender, and 44 heterosexual cisgender participants. In contrast to previous studies reporting significantly higher frequency of substance use and more severe symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among SGM youth compared to heterosexual cisgender peers, many of these health disparities were not observed in our diverse study population of service-seeking youth. Furthermore, with the exception of methamphetamine, SGM participants did not exhibit greater harmful risks resulting from substance use, such as health, social, financial, and legal complications. We discuss the reduced burden of health disparities between SGM and heterosexual cisgender youth in our service-seeking study population within the context of gender- and sexuality-affirming programming offered at the partnering community organization. We conclude that longitudinal data on these tailored community-level interventions are needed to further explore the reduced burden of health disparities observed among service-seeking SGM youth experiencing homelessness in San Francisco in order to continue supporting pathways out of homelessness for youth of all sexual and gender identities nationwide.

Exploring the operationalisation and implementation of outreach in community settings with hard-to-reach and hidden populations: Protocol for a scoping review,"Krabbe, J.; Jiao, S.; Guta, A.; Slemon, A.; Cameron, A.A.; Bungay, V.","Introduction Outreach is regularly identified as an effective strategy to engage underserved, hard-to-reach and hidden populations with essential life-sustaining health services. Despite the increasing expansion of outreach programmes, particularly in HIV prevention and health promotion with youth, sex workers, people living with mental health and substance use challenges, and those affected by homelessness, there has been limited synthesis of the evidence concerning the core components of outreach programming or indicators of its successful implementation. Without this understanding, current outreach programmes may be limited in achieving the desired aims. The aim of this scoping review is to explore how outreach has been operationalised and implemented in various community settings with people underserved in current healthcare contexts. Understanding the state of knowledge pertaining to outreach as programming and as practice involving the engagement of people considered hard-to-reach will enable the identification of promising trends and limitations in the field. Methods and analysis This scoping review follows the Arksey and O'Malley's framework. CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed databases will be searched for peer-reviewed references focused on outreach with hard-to-reach and hidden groups from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2020. Guided by explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, three reviewers will independently assess references in two successive stages. Titles and abstracts will be reviewed followed by full-text assessment of papers meeting the review criteria. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries and a thematic analysis will be carried out on extracted data. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was not required as the only data source was peer-reviewed documents. Outreach knowledge users who are members of the project team will participate in all aspects of study design, implementation and result dissemination strategies.  ©",2021,,BMJ Open,11,2,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039451,,#1197,Krabbe 2021,,
"Association of Care Environment with HIV Incidence and Death among Orphaned, Separated, and Street-Connected Children and Adolescents in Western Kenya","Braitstein, P.; Delong, A.; Ayuku, D.; Ott, M.; Atwoli, L.; Galárraga, O.; Sang, E.; Hogan, J.","Importance: In 2015, there were nearly 140 million orphaned children globally, particularly in low- and middle-income regions, and millions more for whom the street is central to their everyday lives. A total of 16.6 million children were orphaned because of deaths associated with HIV/AIDS, of whom 90% live in sub-Saharan Africa. Although most orphaned and separated children and adolescents in this region are cared for by extended family, the large number of children requiring care has produced a proliferation of institutional care. Few studies have investigated the association between care environment and physical health among orphaned and separated youths in sub-Saharan Africa. Objective: To examine the association of care environment with incident HIV and death among orphaned and separated children and adolescents who were living in charitable children's institutions, family-based settings, and street settings in western Kenya over almost 10 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Orphaned and Separated Children's Assessments Related to Their Health and Well-Being (OSCAR) project was an observational prospective cohort study conducted in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. The cohort comprised 2551 orphaned, separated, and street-connected children from communities within 8 administrative locations, which included 300 randomly selected households (family-based settings) caring for children who were orphaned from all causes, 19 charitable children's institutions (institutional settings), and a convenience sample of 100 children who were practicing self-care on the streets (street settings). Participants were enrolled from May 31, 2010, to April 24, 2013, and were followed up until November 30, 2019. Exposures: Care environment (family-based, institutional, or street setting). Main Outcomes and Measures: Survival regression models were used to investigate the association between care environment and incident HIV, death, and time to incident HIV or death. Results: Among 2551 participants, 1230 youths were living in family-based settings, 1230 were living in institutional settings, and 91 were living in street settings. Overall, 1321 participants (51.8%) were male, with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 10.4 (4.8) years. Most participants who were living in institutional (1047 of 1230 youths [85.1%]) or street (71 of 91 youths [78.0%]) settings were double orphaned (ie, both parents had died). A total of 59 participants acquired HIV infection or died during the study period. After adjusting for sex, age, and baseline HIV status, living in a charitable children's institution was not associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-1.02) or incident HIV (AHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.46-4.83). Compared with living in a family-based setting, living in a street setting was associated with death (AHR, 5.46; 95% CI, 2.30-12.94), incident HIV (AHR, 17.31; 95% CI, 5.85-51.25), and time to incident HIV or death (AHR, 7.82; 95% CI, 3.48-17.55). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, after adjusting for potential confounders, no association was found between care environment and HIV incidence or death among youths living in institutional vs family-based settings. However, living in a street setting vs a family-based setting was associated with both HIV incidence and death. This study's findings suggest that strengthening of child protection systems and greater investment in evidence-based family support systems that improve child and adolescent health and prevent youth migration to the street are needed for safe and beneficial deinstitutionalization to be implemented at scale.  © 2021 Braitstein P et al.",2021,,JAMA Netw.

"Unreal, unsheltered, unseen, unrecorded: The multiple invisibilities of LGBTQI+ homeless youth","Norris, M.; Quilty, A.","There is significant research evidence which demonstrates that LGBTQI+ young people experience higher rates of homelessness than their straight and cis peers. However, estimates of the scale of their over representation in homelessness vary significantly. This partially reflects difficulties in identifying and researching LGBTQI+ homeless youth due to their invisibility within homeless services. Drawing on in-depth interviews with homeless LGBTQI+ youth in Dublin and other Irish cities and with policy makers, homeless service providers and advocacy group representatives, this article reflects on the causes and implications of this invisibility. As its title suggests, the article identifies four interrelated causes of the invisibility – the unreal, unsheltered, unseen and unrecorded nature of LGBTQI+ youth homelessness. The article examines how these factors individually and collectively perpetuate the invisibility of LGBTQI+ homeless youth, impede their access to services for homeless people and reduce the likelihood that homeless services will be tailored to meet their needs and enable them to successfully exit homelessness. © The Author(s) 2020.",2021,,Crit.

The influence of peer relationships on young people's sexual health in Sub-Saharan African street contexts,"Hunter, J.; van Blerk, L.; Shand, W.","This paper explores the interaction between peer relationships and sexual health among street youth in three Sub-Saharan African cities: Accra (Ghana), Bukavu (Democratic Republic of Congo), and Harare (Zimbabwe). It begins by conceptualising peer relationships for youth globally and considers why these are pivotal for young people living in street settings. The paper reconceptualizes street peer relationships not as replacement families, but as sharing ‘social anchorage’ in the street space. It draws on qualitative ethnographic data from Growing up on the Streets, a longitudinal research project with a participatory methodology undertaken between 2012 and 2016 and engaging street youth (aged 14–20 at project outset) trained in ethnographic observations as research assistants (n = 18), following a network of ten peers (n = 229 by 2016), reporting their experiences in weekly interviews with facilitators. A wider network attended focus groups (n = 399). The project engaged a ‘capability’ approach, with ten capabilities defined by street youth as key to their daily lives. Empirical evidence is from a subset of data qualitatively coded (using NVivo) against capabilities ‘Health and Wellbeing’ and ‘Friendship’, across all interviews, focus groups and cities (n = 212 sources). In exploring this intersection, the paper demonstrates beneficial and adverse impacts of peer influence on sexual health, including misinformation about contraceptives and death from an informal sector abortion; highlighting findings from across the three cities around primacy of same-sex peer relations, mistrust between genders and in healthcare providers. The paper finds that while street youth remain subject to cultural norms around gender identities, street peer relationships hold a persuasive power; contributing to both everyday survival and moments of acute need. It concludes that recognising the right of young people to live and seek livelihoods in urban settings, and adopting the social networks they create to advance street youth's sexual health has become even more relevant in a (post)pandemic world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Soc.

Toward Many Emerging Adulthoods: A Theory-Based Examination of the Features of Emerging Adulthood for Cross-Systems Youth,"Bowen, E.; Ball, A.; Jones, A.S.; Miller, B.","Although it is widely acknowledged that emerging adulthood is experienced differently by various groups, few studies have directly examined the theoretical features of emerging adulthood in vulnerable subpopulations of low-income young people in the United States. This study addressed this gap by exploring the salience of the five features proposed in emerging adulthood theory—identity exploration, instability, feeling in-between, sense of self-focus, and optimism for the future—for cross-systems youth. Two samples from prior qualitative studies of young people age 18–24 who had experienced homelessness, child welfare involvement, and/or educational disadvantage were combined for the analysis (N = 50). We noted important divergences and nuances in the ways in which the theoretical features resonated with the sample. For example, most participants sought financial stability and independence, rather than identity and career exploration. The findings speak to the importance of further research to establish features of emerging adulthood in diverse populations. © 2021 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood and SAGE Publishing.",2021,,Emerg.

Family ‘turning point’ experiences and the process of youth becoming homeless,"Mayock, P.; Parker, S.; Murphy, A.","The role of family environments, where conflict—ranging from disagreements between young people and their parent(s) or carers to home-based circumstances where violence and/or abuse is present—is well documented in research that has examined the causes and correlates of youth homelessness. However, far less attention has focused on how young people themselves frame and understand the significance of family ruptures. This paper examines the family ‘turning point’ experiences embedded in the life stories of homeless youth. The study, which was biographical and longitudinal, aimed to generate an in-depth understanding of the nature of homelessness, how it emerged and its impacts on the lives of young people. Conducted in Ireland, 40 youth aged 16–24 years were recruited at baseline, with all interviews commencing with an invitation to young people to tell their ‘life story’. Analysis of participants' life story narratives revealed three major family turning point experiences associated with parental absence and separation, bereavement and acute interruptions to family life. These turning points, the effects of which had a temporal character, reveal the rippling impact of family ruptures on the lives of young people who embarked on a path of leaving home and becoming homeless. The implications of the findings for enhancing engagement with the families of young people who experience homelessness are discussed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,,Child Fam. Soc.

Documenting Behavioral Health Needs in an Urban Setting,"Hudson, D.; McCrary, S.; Murugan, V.; Gerassi, L.; Proctor, E.K.","Most local communities lack the capacity to conduct behavioral health needs assessments. The purpose of this paper is to describe a mixed-methods approach to estimate the behavioral health needs in St. Louis, MO. Data were drawn from multiple sources including local and state government prevalence estimates, medical records, and key informant interviews. The most prevalent behavioral conditions were depression, alcohol, and drug abuse. Priority populations were residents with co-occurring disorders, youth transitioning into the adult behavioral system, and homeless individuals with behavioral health needs. Treatment rates for behavioral health conditions were low, relative to identified needs. There are significant provider shortages and high staff turnover, which extend wait times, diminish the quality of care, and contribute to the use of emergency departments for behavioral health care. The data and methods described in this paper could be helpful to other municipalities that are looking to conduct behavioral health needs assessments. © Copyright © 2021 Hudson, McCrary, Murugan, Gerassi and Proctor.",2021,,Front.

Health care utilization due to substance abuse among homeless and nonhomeless children and young adults in new york,"Sakai-Bizmark, R.; Webber, E.J.; Estevez, D.; Murillo, M.; Marr, E.H.; Bedel, L.E.M.; Mena, L.A.; Felix, J.C.D.; Smith, L.M.","Objective: Substance abuse, particularly among homeless youths, is a significant public health challenge in the United States. Detailed data about health care utilization resulting from this preventable behavior remain sparse. This study aimed to compare health care utilization rates related to substance abuse among homeless and nonhomeless youths. Methods: A secondary data analysis evaluated records of homeless and nonhomeless patients under age 25 with a primary diagnosis of substance abuse, identified in 2013 and 2014 New York Statewide Inpatient and Emergency Department (ED) Databases. Outcomes included ED visit rate, hospitalization rate, in-hospital mortality, cost, length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and revisit or readmission rate. Multivariable regression models with a year fixed effect and facility random effect were used to evaluate the association between homelessness and each outcome. Results: A total of 68,867 cases included hospitalization or an ED visit related to substance abuse (68,118 nonhomeless and 749 homeless cases). Rates of ED visits related to substance abuse were 9.38 and 4.96, while rates of hospitalizations related to substance abuse were 10.53 and 1.01 per 1,000 homeless and nonhomeless youths, respectively. Homeless patients were more likely to utilize and revisit the ICU, be hospitalized or readmitted, incur higher costs, and have longer LOS than nonhomeless youths (all p,0.01). Conclusions: The hospitalization and ED visit rates related to substance abuse were 10 and two times higher among homeless youths compared with nonhomeless youths, respectively.

When a house is never a home: Housing instability among youth affected by parental drug abuse,"Lewis, Q.J.; Smith, B.D.; Offiong, A.; Prioleau, M.; Powell, T.W.","Background: The negative consequences of parental substance abuse are significant and longstanding for children. Among other risks, these youth are more likely to experience housing instability. The most common predictor of a child not living with their biological parent is parental substance use. Research shows that these youth are at higher risks of housing instability; however, little is known about their housing experiences, from their perspective. This study explored the housing experiences of youth affected by parental substance abuse. Participants and setting: Fourteen African American young adults ages 18 to 24 years old who identified having at least one biological parent with a history of substance use participated in this study. The study is based in Baltimore, MD, USA; an urban city with one of the highest rates of drug overdose and substantial disadvantage. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted among fourteen young adults (18–24) affected by parental drug use to discuss their housing experiences throughout childhood and adolescence. Five research team members developed a codebook, double coded all transcripts and analyzed inductively using a qualitative content analytic approach. Results: Three themes emerged to characterize housing experiences: frequent housing transitions, repeated trauma exposures related to housing instability, and the lasting effects of housing instability. Conclusion: The residual impacts of parental substance use have caused youth to experience the toxic stress and trauma associated with housing instability. It is important that young people have safe, stable and reliable housing to promote child health and normative development. © 2021",2021,,Child Abuse Negl.,118,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105131,,#1217,Lewis 2021,,
Correlates of Housing Sustainability Among Youth Placed Into Permanent Supportive Housing and Rapid Re-Housing: A Survival Analysis,"Hsu, H.-T.; Hill, C.; Holguin, M.; Petry, L.; McElfresh, D.; Vayanos, P.; Morton, M.; Rice, E.","Purpose: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are vulnerable to multiple adverse health outcomes. Connecting YEH with housing is critical to addressing youth homelessness and to preventing long-term negative health consequences among this vulnerable population. Using administrative data, this study aims to explore correlates of YEH's sustainability in two major housing programs: permanent supportive housing (PSH) and rapid re-housing (RRH) programs. Methods: This study used Homelessness Management Information System administrative data collected from 16 communities across the U.S. between January 1, 2015 and May 1, 2017 (n = 10,902). We conducted Cox proportional hazards survival analyses to explore correlates (e.g., demographics, homeless experiences, and overall vulnerability) of YEH's PSH (n = 577) and RRH (n = 2,883) sustainability separately. Results: For YEH receiving PSH, only individuals' level of vulnerability is associated with greater hazard of exiting PSH. As for RRH sustainability, YEH who were 17 years old or younger, black or Latinx (as compared to white), of higher level of vulnerability, or previously spent most nights couch surfing or in transitional living programs (as compared to on the street) are associated with higher hazard of exiting RRH. Conclusions: Both PSH and RRH programs should incorporate comprehensive services targeting youth experiencing high vulnerability to prevent them from re-entering homelessness. Future RRH programming should also address housing sustainability disparities faced by racial and ethnic minority YEH, especially when they are disproportionately influenced by homelessness. Finally, RRH programs should incorporate services to foster independent living among younger YEH to sustain their housing status once temporary housing subsidies expire. © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2021,,J.

Climate Change Impacts on Environment: Human Displacement and Social Conflicts in Nigeria,"Olagunju, T.E.; Adewoye, S.O.; Adewoye, A.O.; Opasola, O.A.","In northern Nigeria, drought and desertification have grossly affected water available and land carrying capacity for both pastureland and farmlands. Hence, the northerners, particularly, the youthinevitably migrate to the south for greener pasture for themselves and the animals. Most of these youths are uneducated and not skilled to secure employment, they, therefore, become an instrument in the hands of religious bigotry. This climatic change can also result in a rise in sea level, thereby increasing the flood events especially, in Nigeria's lowlands. These changes have not only caused fierce conflicts buthave additionally brought about the death of thousands and rendered many homeless. The Nigeria Middle Belt has been the region most impacted by violent death resulting from land resource scarcity. The conflict has ensued between contrasting groups when essential resources become scarcely limited. Northern Nigeria accounts for 68% of every fiercedeath due to the issues of land between farmers and pastoralists in 2006 and 2014, a figure not half the reported cases in 2018 alone. The inadequacies in the Nigerian adaptation efforts to its dwindling climate could be attributed to corruption, institutional shortcomings and political will predisposes the country to more dangers of environmental change impacts.

Bullying at School and on the Street: Risk Factors and Outcomes Among Homeless Youth,"Tyler, K.A.; Schmitz, R.M.","Though rates of bullying among general population youth are high, there is elevated prevalence among certain subgroups, in particular sexual minority homeless youth. Enduring bullying can have devastating consequences, including poor mental health, revictimization, and substance abuse. The current study compares risk factors (i.e., sexual orientation, gender, and child abuse) for being bullied both at school and on the street among homeless youth. We also examine the associations of both contexts of bullying (i.e., at school and on the street) with physical and sexual victimization while on the street, with illicit drug use. From July 2014 to October 2015, we interviewed 150 homeless youth aged 16 to 22 years in shelters and on the streets from two Midwestern cities. Our sample was 51% female and 22% identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB). Results revealed that LGB youth experienced more frequent bullying at school and were more likely to have ever used one or more illicit drugs at least a few times compared with heterosexual youth. Moreover, youth who experienced more child abuse prior to leaving home were also victimized more often at school (school bullying) and on the street (street bullying). Young people who experienced more sexual and physical street victimization were more likely to report illicit drug use compared with those who had fewer street victimization experiences. Overall, youth who experience victimization in one context (i.e., home) are at heightened risk for being bullied in additional contexts (i.e., school). These findings have important policy and service intervention implications, such that service providers should attend to homeless youth’s multiple social contexts of victimization and the potential for youth’s illicit drug use as a coping mechanism. © The Author(s) 2018.",2021,,J.

Social vulnerability and COVID-19: A call to action for paediatric clinicians,"Prodanuk, M.; Wagner, S.; Orkin, J.; Noone, D.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had dramatic effects on the lives of children globally. However, socially vulnerable children have been particularly impacted. Certain populations have increased vulnerabilities, including children and youth experiencing homelessness. Increased infection risk due to congregant living and challenges with physical distancing are contributing factors. An urgent need exists for a wholistic approach to care with unique cross-sectoral partnerships across disciplines. A recognition of the unintended consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population is urgently required by all those supporting children.

A Latent Class Analysis of Lifetime Victimization Among Homeless Youth,"Tyler, K.A.; Ray, C.M.","Homeless youth experience high rates of child physical and sexual abuse, and many are revictimized on the streets. Despite their high rates of victimization, few studies have examined whether specific victimization types (e.g., sexual vs. physical) cluster together and for whom (e.g., sexual minority youth). As such, the purpose of this study was to identify clusters of homeless youth based on their exposure to different forms of child abuse and street victimization, to examine what factors distinguish each cluster, and how unique clusters are related to youths’ mental health using data collected at two time points. The sample included 150 youth experiencing homelessness in the Midwest. Latent class analysis was used to identify clusters of youth. Three latent classes emerge: The low exposure class had significantly lower rates of child physical and emotional abuse and threats compared with the medium- and high-exposure groups. The high exposure group had significantly higher rates of child sexual abuse compared with the other groups. Females, sexual minority youth, and those who have lived in more foster care homes were more likely to be in the high exposure group compared with the low and/or medium exposure groups. Multivariate results revealed that those in the medium and high exposure cluster groups had higher rates of Wave 1 depressive symptoms and Wave 1 anxiety compared with youth in the low exposure cluster.

Access experiences and attitudes toward abortion among youth experiencing homelessness in the United States: A systematic review,"Munro, S.; Benipal, S.; Williams, A.; Wahl, K.; Trenaman, L.; Begun, S.","Objectives We sought to review the literature on the access experiences and attitudes toward abortion among youth experiencing homelessness in the United States. Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published from 2001 to 2019. We included qualitative studies involving US participants that focused on access experiences, views, or accounts of unintended pregnancy and/or abortion among youth experiencing homelessness. We excluded studies published before 2001 as that was the year mifepristone medication abortion was made available in the US and we aimed to investigate experiences of access to both medical and surgical abortion options. Results Our thematic analysis of the data resulted in five key themes that characterize the abortion attitudes and access experiences of youth experiencing homelessness: (1) engaging in survival sex and forced sex, (2) balancing relationships and autonomy, (3) availability does not equal access, (4) attempting self-induced abortions using harmful methods, and (5) feeling resilient despite traumatic unplanned pregnancy experiences. Conclusions Youth experiencing homelessness experience barriers to abortion access across the US, including in states with a supportive policy context and publicly funded abortion services. In the absence of accessible services, youth may consider harmful methods of self-induced abortion. Improved services should be designed to offer low-barrier abortion care with the qualities that youth identified as important to them, including privacy and autonomy. © 2021 Munro et al.

Addressing intersecting social and mental health needs among transition-age homeless youths: A review of the literature,"Winiarski, D.A.; Glover, A.C.; Bounds, D.T.; Karnik, N.S.","Homelessness among youths is a poorly understood and complex social phenomenon. The authors examined the risk factors for homelessness among transition-age young adults, including the unique mental health concerns that often perpetuate the cycle of poverty and housing instability among these youths. The authors discuss the treatment gaps for mental health conditions in this population and identify potential solutions for reducing existing barriers to care. A literature review revealed that many studies report high rates of trauma and subsequent mental health problems among homeless youths. Intervention studies are challenging to conduct with this population and often have high attrition rates. Youths who are homeless desire mental health services and are especially enthusiastic about programs that address interpersonal difficulties and emotion regulation. Clinical data suggest that future interventions should address trauma more directly in this population. Technology-based interventions may help address the needs of homeless youths and may maximize their access to care. Because youths strongly prefer technology-based platforms, future research should integrate these platforms to better address the mental health needs identified as most salient by homeless youths. The authors discuss proposed policy changes at local, state, and federal levels to improve uptake of this proposed strategy. © 2021 American Psychiatric Association.

The Lived Experience of Adolescents in Homeless Families,"Reeves, M.G.","The experience of adolescent homelessness is best understood from the perspective of those experiencing it. Although there is existing literature on the experiences of street youths and on the risk factors of youth homelessness, little of it has explored the experience of adolescents in homeless families as well as their strengths and their resources. Through discourse and photography, the research described in this article explored the lived experience of a particular group of adolescents who were living with their homeless families. Through a lens of critical phenomenology using in-depth interviews and photographs, the overarching theme that emerged was how resources, including family, friends, and safety, helped youths stay positive in a challenging situation. The results of this study articulate the self-identified strengths, assets, and coping skills of the cohort, and the perspectives of these adolescents will help professionals identify strategies that may benefit other adolescents in homeless families.

Challenging the stereotypes: Unexpected features of sexual exploitation among homeless and street-involved boys in western canada,"Saewyc, E.M.; Shankar, S.; Pearce, L.A.; Smith, A.","Research about the sexual exploitation of homeless and street-involved boys is limited and often combined with that of girls. As aggregation can distort unique issues among genders which are exploited, this study provides information about the context of exploitation for homeless boys. Boys participated in the anonymous, multi-city British Columbia (BC), Canada Homeless and Street-Involved Youth Health paper surveys of 2006 and 2014. Measures included questions about trading sex for money, shelter, or other consideration; age first exploited; for whom; where they were living when first traded sex; gender of exploiters; and demographics. Analyses, separately for younger/older boys, explored the prevalence, timing of exploitation vs. homelessness, and ANOVAs to evaluate the patterns of the age of first exploitation by the genders of exploiters. Just over one in four boys reported exploitation (n = 132), with a median age of 14–15 in most groups. Most were runaway or homeless before their first exploitation, but 25.5% (2006) and 41% (2014) were living with family. Most boys were exploited by women (78%–85%), with 62%–65% were exclusively exploited by women. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021,,Int. J. Environ. Res.

Social network correlates of education and employment service use among youth experiencing homelessness: A longitudinal study,"DiGuiseppi, G.; Clomax, A.; Rampton Dodge, J.; Rice, E.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face significant obstacles to educational achievement and gainful employment. Drop-in centers offer support services to facilitate these opportunities, but there remains a need to understand which youth are most likely to use them. The present study used a diffusion of innovations framework to examine social network correlates of service use over a three-month period. Positive staff relationships, personal network exposure, and structural network measures were examined. Methods: Participants were 253 YEH (Mage = 21.9, SD = 2.2) participating in an HIV-prevention trial at three drop-in centers in Los Angeles. Surveys were completed at baseline (wave 1), 1-month (wave 2) and 3-months (wave 3) post-baseline. Individual characteristics and sociometric network ties to other youth were assessed. Cross-sectional and lagged logistic regression models were used to identify significant network correlates of service use. Results: A significant minority of YEH used education (23.6%) or employment (33.7%) services at wave 1, with modest increases at waves 2 and 3. Indegree centrality was associated with education service use at wave 1 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI[1.04, 1.64]). Positive staff relationships were associated with employment service use at wave 1 (OR = 2.05, 95% CI[1.06, 2.99]), and outdegree was associated with employment service use at wave 3 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI[1.13, 2.55]). In addition, education level, housing situation, LGBTQ+ identity, drop-in center location, and duration of drop-in center use were related to service usage. Conclusions: Youth who occupy more central network positions and/or report positive relationships with staff are more likely to use higher-level drop-in services. Network approaches to engaging youth in services should be considered along with other individual and contextual factors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child. Youth Serv.

Needs of homeless children in the Czech Republic,"Glumbíková, K.; Mikulec, M.","The needs of homeless children living in shelters and hostels in the Czech Republic have been not sufficiently explored yet. The paper therefore aims to analyse and describe the needs of homeless children living in shelters and hostels in the Czech Republic, thus creating a basis for social work with homeless children and their families. As part of a qualitative research strategy carried out through interviews with parents, children and their social workers, five categories of homeless children's needs (based on Matějček's theory) were identified and described in detail based on a data analysis using Charmaz's Grounded Theory; these categories were the need for stimulation, the need for a meaningful world, the need for love and emotional safety, the need for identity and finding one's own place in society and the need for a life perspective and open future. Based on the identified needs, implications for social work with families were identified, strengthening a sensitive approach of helping professions to the needs of homeless children. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,,Child Fam.

Victimization and Resilience Among Sexual and Gender Minority Homeless Youth Engaging in Survival Sex,"Alessi, E.J.; Greenfield, B.; Manning, D.; Dank, M.","This study examined how a diverse group of sexual and gender minority (SGM) homeless youth described and understood their victimization experiences occurring before they were homeless and those occurring after they were homeless and engaging in survival sex. In addition, the study explored how these youths manifested resilience when living on the street. The sample consisted of 283 racially/ethnically diverse youth between the ages of 15 and 26 years (M = 19.6, SD = 1.28) living in a large U.S. city. Participants identified their gender as male (47%), female (36%), transgender (15%), or queer and other (3%) and their sexual orientation as bisexual (37%), gay (23%), lesbian (15%), heterosexual (13%), or queer and other (13%). Thirty-seven percent identified as Black, 30% as multiracial, 22% as Latino/a, 5% as White, and 5% as another race. Content and thematic analyses were used to conduct a secondary analysis of qualitative data. Four themes were identified: unsafe and unsupported at home; barriers to housing and employment stability; ongoing victimization and lack of protection; and unexpected opportunities for resilience. Findings demonstrated that participants experienced victimization related not only to their SGM identities but also to chaotic home environments. Once homeless and engaging in survival sex, youth experienced barriers to securing employment and housing as well as victimization by police and clients. These experiences frequently involved prejudice related to their intersecting identities. Despite encountering numerous challenges, participants described surviving on the streets by living openly and forming relationships with other youth. Implications for practice and policy are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.",2021,,J. Interpers. Violence,36,23-24,11236-11259,,10.1177/0886260519898434,,#1248,Alessi 2021,,
Improving outcomes in young people experiencing homelessness with My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™): A qualitative realist evaluation,"Parry, B.J.; Quinton, M.L.; Holland, M.J.G.; Thompson, J.L.; Cumming, J.","Young people experiencing homelessness often have multiple and complex support needs, and subsequently face various health inequalities. In the United Kingdom, housing services recognise the need for more effective intervention strategies. In response to this issue, My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) is a community- and outdoors-based, positive youth development programme that aims to promote meaningful change for young people experiencing homelessness (aged 16–24). Capturing the experiences of programme participants, housing service staff and outdoor instructors, a realist evaluation was conducted to understand how, why, and for whom the programme is effective. Findings indicate that MST4Life™ is an effective intervention for fostering psychosocial development, intentional self-regulation, and longer-term positive behavioural change. Central to the success of the programme is a consistent theory-informed approach, a strengths-based life skills programme, and an appropriate transfer setting.

Health-Care Utilization Due to Suicide Attempts among Homeless Youth in New York State,"Sakai-Bizmark, R.; Kumamaru, H.; Estevez, D.; Marr, E.H.; Haghnazarian, E.; Bedel, L.E.M.; Mena, L.A.; Kaplan, M.S.","Suicide remains the leading cause of death among homeless youth. We assessed differences in health-care utilization between homeless and nonhomeless youth presenting to the emergency department or hospital after a suicide attempt. New York Statewide Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases (2009-2014) were used to identify homeless and nonhomeless youth aged 10-17 who utilized health-care services following a suicide attempt. To evaluate associations with homelessness, we used logistic regression models for use of violent means, intensive care unit utilization, log-transformed linear regression models for hospitalization cost, and negative binomial regression models for length of stay. All models adjusted for individual characteristics with a hospital random effect and year fixed effect. We identified 18,026 suicide attempts with health-care utilization rates of 347.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 317.5, 377.0) and 67.3 (95% CI: 66.3, 68.3) per 100,000 person-years for homeless and nonhomeless youth, respectively. Length of stay for homeless youth was statistically longer than that for nonhomeless youth (incidence rate ratio = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.77). All homeless youth who visited the emergency department after a suicide attempt were subsequently hospitalized.

Can Better Emotion Regulation Protect Against Interpersonal Violence in Homeless Youth Social Networks?,"Petering, R.; Barr, N.; Rice, E.","Homeless youth experience all types of violence at higher rates than their housed counterparts. This is typically the result of many contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma, subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while living on the streets. Reducing violence in the lives of homeless youth is imperative and can contribute to a young person’s ability to safely and successfully exit the streets and lead a long and productive life in society. However, developing public health and social interventions to reduce violence in adolescent and young adult populations is difficult due to the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of this phenomenon. Los Angeles area homeless youth (N = 366) were asked questions regarding recent violence experiences, emotion regulation, and their social network. Multivariable logistic regressions tested the overall effect of emotion regulation on violence, controlling for age, gender, race, sexual identity, experience of childhood abuse, and data collection site. In this sample, 56% of youth endorsed fighting in the previous year, and those who reported more difficulties with emotion regulation were significantly more likely to fight. In addition, youth who scored below the mean on difficulties with regulation and belonged to networks characterized by low-difficulty peers were 60% less likely to report fighting. Emotion regulation skills represent a malleable target for intervention that may contribute to reduced propensity for violence in this population. Implications for network-based interventions to improve individual emotion regulation and reduce overall violence among homeless youth and other at-risk populations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.",2021,,J.

The Second National Canadian Homeless Youth Survey: Mental Health and Addiction Findings: La Deuxième Enquête Nationale Auprès des Jeunes Sans Abri : Résultats en Matière De Santé Mentale et de Toxicomanie,"Kidd, S.A.; Gaetz, S.; O’Grady, B.; Schwan, K.; Zhao, H.; Lopes, K.; Wang, W.","Objective: Youth experiencing homelessness represent a major social problem in Canada and, as demonstrated in the first national survey of this population conducted in 2015, are experiencing significant mental health challenges. The present study examines the findings of a second national survey completed in 2019. These findings afford the opportunity to examine the reliability of the findings of the first study with another large, representative sample and to attempt to articulate the unique characteristics of youth experiencing the greatest distress among this at-risk population. Methods: This study analyzed the mental-health-related data from the 2019 Without a Home–National Youth Homelessness Survey that was administered through convenience sampling at 98 agencies serving homeless youth in 49 communities across Canada. The survey was cross-sectional and self-administered, assessing a range of demographic information, pre- and post-homelessness variables, and mental health indicators. Multinomial logistic regression and linear regression were implemented to evaluate associations with distress level. Results: Survey data were obtained from 1,375 youth accessing Canadian homeless services in 9 provinces. Thirty-five percent reported at least 1 suicide attempt, and 33.1% reported a drug overdose requiring hospitalization. The findings of this survey replicated most of the key findings from the 2015 survey. The current findings emphasized, for this high-risk population, the heightened adversity faced by young women, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S), and Indigenous subpopulations, as well as the centrality of violence exposure in determining risk and distress. Sexual violence, in particular, emerged as a key factor in the identification of youth experiencing the greatest distress with risk buffered by contact with family. Conclusions: These findings can inform prevention and intervention policies and services and reinforce the importance of attending to violence exposure and trauma as central to the mental health trajectories of youth who have experienced homelessness. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Can.

Housing interventions for emerging adults experiencing homelessness: A scoping review,"Semborski, S.; Redline, B.; Madden, D.; Granger, T.; Henwood, B.","Introduction: This review aims to identify and synthesize literature focused on housing interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness. Methods: Following a five-stage approach to scoping reviews, a computerized search was conducted between February 4–8, 2019 to include peer-reviewed articles from a total of eight electronic databases: PsychINFO, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Social Work Abstracts, Cochrane, Clinicaltrials.gov, and CINAHL. The search was limited to include literature published between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 2018. Search parameters included three domains: homelessness, housing intervention, and age. Results: Of the initial 7,344 sources identified, 29 articles met the search criteria and were included in the final sample. Housing models discussed in the reviewed literature include Permanent Supportive Housing, Transitional and Independent Housing and Living Programs, the Foyer model, Housing First, and general Supportive Housing. Housing models were discussed in the context of outcome domains including quality of life, education, employment, housing tenure, cost of intervention, systems and service use, HIV, and social network and relationships. Discussion: Housing interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness remains a relatively new intervention to combat homelessness among younger demographics. While the evidence base continues to grow, there remains a need for quality research to generate empirical evidence in this area, though studies included in this review showed promise for the development of best housing practices with this population. © 2021",2021,,Child.

"Young Transgender Women of Color: Homelessness, Poverty, Childhood Sexual Abuse and Implications for HIV Care","Eastwood, E.A.; Nace, A.J.; Hirshfield, S.; Birnbaum, J.M.","This study describes a sample of HIV+ young transgender women of color aged 18–24 and their experience with homelessness as part of a demonstration project of engagement and retention in HIV medical care funded by Health Resources and Services Administration. The study engaged transgender women of color in HIV care in nine sites across the US between 2012 and 2017. This analysis describes and compares transwomen who had been homeless in the last 6 months to those not homeless. We hypothesized that homelessness would compete with HIV care, food, shelter, and be associated with poverty. Variable domains included sociodemographic, mental health and substance use, HIV care, sexual risk behavior, social support from transgender and other friends, and childhood sexual abuse. There were 102 youth enrolled, 77 (75.5%) who had been homeless, and 25 (24.5%) who had not been homeless. Bivariate analyses showed that low income, sex work as source of income, inability to afford food, lack of viral load (VL) suppression, childhood sexual abuse, lower levels of social support, and higher levels of depression were associated with homelessness. A logistic regression model showed that being unable to afford food (AOR = 9.24, 95% CI 2.13–40.16), lack of VL suppression in last 6 months (AOR = 0.10, 95% CI.02–.57), and lack of transgender friend support (AOR = 0.09, 95% CI.02–.53) was associated with homelessness.

This study aimed to measure the frequency and associated factors of sex out of marriage and condom use among homeless youth in Kerman, Iran. Study design: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 202 homeless youth (age: 15–29 years who experienced 30 or more days of homelessness in the last 12 months) from 11 street locations between September to December 2017. Methods: Of 202 participants, 169 (83.7%) reported sex in the last 12 months and were include in this analysis. We assessed the prevalence of sex out of marriage in the last 12 months, condom use in last sex, and then evaluated their covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of sex out of marriage was 19.6% (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 13.8%, 26.3%) and the prevalence of condom use was 43.8% (95% CI: 36.2%, 51.6%). Sex out of marriage was significantly correlated with male gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 24.38; 95% CI: 3.1–192.1) and being unmarried (AOR: 5.94; 95% CI: 2.3–15.5).

At risk and in love: A mixed methodexamination of the link between childhood maltreatment and youth relationships,"Bay-Cheng, L.Y.; Ginn, H.G.; Fava, N.M.; Maguin, E.M.; Bascug, E.W.","Introduction: Research indicates that sexual and romantic relationships play an important role in youth well-being and development. This strengths-based perspective sits in tension with the documented risks that youth with histories of maltreatment face in sexual/romantic relationships. We conducted a U.S.-based mixed-method study to examine the connection between childhood maltreatment and youth relationships. Method: We collected retrospective ratings of relationship quality and open-ended comments about those relationships using an online sexual life history calendar. Quantitative analyses drew on data from 98 participants (51 cisgender women, 47 cisgender men) between the ages of 18–25 (Mage = 22.51). Qualitative analyses compared demographically matched subsamples of 19 participants who reported multiple forms of child maltreatment and 20 who reported none. Results: Quantitative analyses indicated that ratings of relationship stability, intimacy, and pleasure were unrelated to prior abuse or neglect. Qualitative analyses showed the relationships of those with multiple maltreatment histories, compared to those without any maltreatment, to be more often intertwined with and complicated by other hardships (e.g., homelessness). Conclusions: Quantitatively, childhood maltreatment appeared unrelated to youth sexual/romantic relationship quality, though we regard those findings with due caution. Complementing this was qualitative evidence of differences between participants based on trauma histories, with those who had experienced childhood maltreatment referring more often to surrounding circumstances and hardships in descriptions of their youth sexual/romantic relationships. These mixed method findings reinforce the importance of youth sexuality research, policy, and practice that takes the broader conditions of young people's lives into consideration. © 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents",2021,,J.

Tackling exclusion: A pilot mixed method quasi-experimental identity capital intervention for young people exiting homelessness,"Thulien, N.S.; Wang, A.; Mathewson, C.; Wang, R.; Hwang, S.W.","Background Longitudinal studies examining the life trajectories of young people after they have exited homelessness have identified concerns with persistent social and economic exclusion, struggles to shake off identities of homelessness, and housing instability. This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness. Methods Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention. Results None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue. Immediately after participating in the intervention, Group One had statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and large to very large effect sizes in self-esteem (d = 1.16) and physical community integration (d = 1.79) compared to changes in Group Two over the same period, which had not yet begun the intervention. In the pooled analysis, small to moderate effect sizes in hopelessness, physical community integration, and self-esteem were observed at all post-intervention time points. Notably, at six- and nine-months postintervention, statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and moderate effect sizes in hopelessness (d = -0.73 and d = -0.60 respectively) and self-esteem (d = 0.71 and d = 0.53 respectively) were observed. Youth shared they appreciated the normalizing (vs. pathologizing) of strategies they needed to learn and spoke of the importance of framing new skills as something one needs ""to have a better life""vs. ""to get better.""Conclusions These early findings signal that targeting identity capital is feasible and may be a promising approach to incorporate into a more complex intervention that includes housing, education, and employment supports to help youth transition out of homelessness. Future research could build on these findings through a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial.  © 2021 Thulien et al.

Systematic Review: The State of Research Into Youth Helplines,"Mathieu, S.L.; Uddin, R.; Brady, M.; Batchelor, S.; Ross, V.; Spence, S.H.; Watling, D.; Kõlves, K.","Objective: Helplines are generally a population-level resource for providing free, timely, easy-to-access, and anonymous counseling and/or information. Helplines have been developed and widely implemented for specific use by young people. The current study aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the status of research into the use of helplines among young people. Method: Following the PRISMA checklist, 5 electronic databases were searched using relevant terms for literature published until May 2020. The extracted studies were summarized with the intention of identifying key themes that highlighted common findings, key implications, and important gaps in understanding. Results: A total of 52 articles fitting study inclusion criteria were identified. Most studies were quantitative papers from the United States and Australia. The types of helpline interactions studied were a mixture of telephone-based and SMS/text-based interactions. Three major themes were identified: awareness of and engagement with helpline services, nature of problems faced by young people, and service-related factors. Subthemes were use and awareness, barriers to help seeking, psychosocial problems, suicidality, telephone- versus text-based interactions, counselor−caller interaction, and provision of services to historically and systemically marginalized groups. Conclusion: It appears that helplines may provide a beneficial service to youths, and that myriad psychosocial concerns provide the basis for calling. The literature is limited by a lack of controlled trials, on one hand, and complex methodological/ethical barriers preventing such trials, on the other hand. However, more research is needed before conclusions regarding effectiveness in youths can be made, particularly for services provided to systemically marginalized groups and using online text-based approaches. © 2020 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry",2021,,J.

Resourcefulness of homeless young people who practise sex work in Pakistan: A qualitative study,"Noor, M.N.; Bryant, J.; De Wit, J.; Holt, M.","Background: Many homeless young people in Pakistan use sex work as a way to generate income, particularly if they have few other options for work. Because it is highly stigmatised, little attention has been paid to the strategies homeless young people use to practise sex work, and what this suggests about their capacities and strengths. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 homeless young people (aged 16-25 years) from Rawalpindi, Pakistan, including nine cisgender heterosexual men, six cisgender heterosexual women, seven cisgender gay men, and seven transgender heterosexual women. Results: Participants sought memberships in street-based peer groups where financial gains were contingent on dancing and sex work. To practise their work successfully, participants learned novel skills and mobilised material resources available to them on the streets. Participants talked about how they acquired and benefitted from skills related to beautification, dancing, communication, and sexual services to achieve the necessary standards for entertainment and sex work. Access to material resources like makeup, clothes, rented rooms, mobile phones and condoms made dancing and sex work possible and safer for participants. Conclusions: Participants' improvisation with limited resources on the streets has important implications for policy and programs. Showcasing the resourcefulness and capacities of young people encourages a different way of thinking about them. This potential could be utilised in productive ways if they were given the chance to receive mainstream and technical education, better health support and access to the formal job market.  © 2021 CSIRO.

Text messaging intervention for young smokers experiencing homelessness: Lessons learned from a randomized controlled trial,"Linnemayr, S.; Zutshi, R.; Shadel, W.; Pedersen, E.; DeYoreo, M.; Tucker, J.","Background: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention. Methods: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it. Results: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership-16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention. Conclusions: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions. © 2021 JMIR Publications.

Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: A Case Series of Male Pediatric Patients,"Moore, J.; Fitzgerald, M.; Owens, T.; Slingsby, B.; Barron, C.; Goldberg, A.","Domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) is the commercial sexual exploitation of children (<18 years old) who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, victimized within U.S. borders. There is limited knowledge and research in regard to male involvement in DMST outside the context of homelessness and runaway youth. To our knowledge, no research specifically examines at-risk or involved male youth from a larger dataset of youth who present to a child abuse outpatient medical clinic. The objective of the present case series was to describe the demographic, psychosocial, medical, and psychiatric characteristics of natal male participants (who did not identify as transgender) suspected of DMST involvement. Six medical records of male patients under the age of 18 who were referred to a child protection clinic for concern of DMST involvement between 8/1/13 and 12/31/18 were retrospectively reviewed. Our case series demonstrates that male participants present for concern of sex trafficking and have complex behavioral, medical, and psychiatric concerns similar to what has been identified in research focused on female victims. Therefore, testing (e.g., sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV testing, urine toxicology screening), DMST screening, and interventions (e.g., STI prophylaxis, referrals to mental health counselors) should be completed in male patients. © The Author(s) 2020.",2021,,J.

“A Bad Combination”: Lived Experiences of Youth Involved in the Foster Care and Juvenile Justice Systems,"Simmons-Horton, S.Y.","Youth with involvement in foster care and the juvenile justice system, often called dual-status youth, are at increased risk for negative outcomes as they transition into adulthood, including homelessness, and involvement in the adult criminal justice system. Increase of interest in the phenomenon of youth dual involvement within the last decade, reveals focus on challenges associated with the dual-status population, the importance of multi-system collaboration, and foster care factors contributing to juvenile delinquency. This study aims to build on the current literature, through exploration of how dually-involved youth make sense of their experiences in the juvenile justice and foster care systems; and what youth believe are their unique challenges of being in two systems? This phenomenological study engaged ten individuals in Houston, Texas, between the ages of 18 and 24 years old, and previously involved in the juvenile justice and foster care systems. Research subjects participated in-depth, semi-structured, and audio-recorded interviews, disclosing their experiences in two systems. Interviews were transcribed and entered in the qualitative analytical program, Atlas.ti, where common themes of participant responses were extracted. Accounts from participants highlighted three key experiences: (1) experiences of and leading to dual involvement, (2) traumatic experiences, and (3) absence of normalcy. Study results are categorized based on their pathways to dual-involvement. This current study offers rich insights into how dually-involved youth make sense of their experiences in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. Implications for enhanced service provision among child welfare and juvenile justice professionals are offered. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Child Adolesc.

Redefining recovery: Accounts of treatment experiences of dependent cannabis users in Nigeria,"Nelson, E.-U.E.; Essien, N.F.","Background: Research on addiction recovery describes recovery as a process leading to cessation of drug use. Few researchers have explored alternative views of recovery, and the interplay of individuals' agency and social context in the recovery process. This study explored situated understandings of recovery among cannabis users that emphasized process and contingency. Methods: We conducted the study in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria. Participants were current (street-involved) cannabis users aged 21 to 34 (n = 97), recruited through time-location sampling. The study collected data through in-depth, individual interviews, which study staff transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Results: Participants' accounts indicated a quest for treatment as a means of recovery and redemption (i.e., repairing an identity damaged by dependent cannabis use). Relapse affected recovery when participants defined the latter as abstinence. Framing recovery this way showed the effects of social and structural factors on individual agency and treatment experiences. Yet some participants' accounts highlighted a redefinition of recovery as a process (“recovering”), measured by such outcomes as reduced drug use and improved overall well-being. Conclusions: Reframing recovery, as some participants' accounts in our study capture, speaks to the need for treatment programs that are informed by the principles of harm reduction and health promotion. Instead of foisting a singular treatment goal defined as total abstinence onto drug users seeking treatment, treatment should be attuned to the experiences and life circumstances of users and support them in achieving their recovery goals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,,J.

"Lifted: A thematic analysis of homeless adolescents’ reflections on their lives since beginning a multifaceted, community-based intervention","Raffaele Mendez, L.M.; Randle, C.A.","The purpose of this study was to gather in-depth information from unaccompanied homeless youth (UHY) regarding how they perceived that a wraparound intervention in which they had been involved for at least one year had impacted their lives. Towards this end, we conducted individual face-to-face interviews with nine unaccompanied homeless youth (UHY) who were receiving services from Starting Right, Now (SRN), a unique, multifaceted, grassroots initiative located in the southeastern U.S. that provides multiple services to UHY who have remained in high school. These services include housing, one-to-one mentoring, tutoring, assistance with applying to college, and specialized trainings to support academic and personal development. In each interview, participants described how their lives had changed since they entered SRN and what they had learned from the program. Using thematic analysis across participants, we identified eight themes that we saw as fitting within three broad categories: (1) constructing new models of relationships, (2) learning adaptive strategies for living, and (3) increasing hope, direction, and purpose. These three themes coalesced into an overall essence that we termed “lifted.” We chose this term because the totality of participants’ experiences suggested that SRN had lifted participants out of the poverty and trauma of their childhoods and, through a comprehensive approach with personalized supports, helped them get to a place where they could focus on higher-level needs like individual growth and educational attainment. Implications for providing services to UHY are described, and avenues for continuing research to support this population are highlighted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child. Youth Serv.

Homelessness and Suicidality: The Role of Bullying and Parental Support,"McCallops, K.; Aviles, A.M.; Earnshaw, V.A.; Palkovitz, R.","Objective: To examine the relation between homelessness and suicidality and to test bullying as a mediator and parental support as a moderator of these relations. Background: Youth from low-income families are more likely to be bullied and in turn experience negative mental health outcomes. Parental support has been reported to mitigate the effects of stressful events, such as being bullied. However, these relations are still undocumented among youth experiencing homelessness. Method: This study included a random sample of 2,049 stably housed and 64 homeless youth enrolled in the Delaware Public Schools, grades 9 through 12, who completed the 2015 Delaware Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Hayes's PROCESS macro was used to test for a moderated mediation relation between bullying, suicidality, and parental support for homeless youth. Results: Bullying mediated the relation between homelessness and suicidality, and parental support moderated the relation between bullying and suicidality. Youth experiencing homelessness reported more bullying, which was associated with more severe suicidality. For youth experiencing homelessness with low levels of parental support, bullying was associated with more severe suicidality. Conversely, for youth with high levels of parental support, bullying was not associated with more severe suicidality. Conclusion: This study indicates that bullying is a mechanism through which homelessness and suicidality are related, while also demonstrating the importance of parental support. Implication: The increased risk of suicidality among youth experiencing homelessness who are bullied, as well as the effects of parental support, warrant attention from school personnel and youth service providers. © 2020 National Council on Family Relations.",2021,,Fam.

Efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to promote HIV risk reduction behaviors among young adults experiencing homelessness: Pilot randomized controlled trial,"Maria, D.S.; Padhye, N.; Businelle, M.; Yang, Y.; Jones, J.; Sims, A.; Lightfoot, M.","Background: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors. Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information. Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges. Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03). Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

"Perceived impacts, acceptability, and recommendations for ecological momentary assessment among youth experiencing homelessness: Qualitative study","Acorda, D.; Businelle, M.; Maria, D.S.","Background: The use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to study youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) behaviors is an emerging area of research. Despite high rates of participation and potential clinical utility, few studies have investigated the acceptability and recommendations for EMA from the YEH perspective. Objective: This study aimed to describe the perceived benefits, usability, acceptability, and barriers to the use of EMA from the homeless youth perspective. Methods: YEH were recruited from a larger EMA study. Semistructured exit interviews were performed using an interview guide that focused on the YEH experience with the EMA app, and included perceived barriers and recommendations for future studies. Data analyses used an inductive approach with thematic analysis to identify major themes and subthemes. Results: A total of 18 YEH aged 19-24 years participated in individual and group exit interviews. The EMA was highly acceptable to YEH and they found the app and EMA surveys easy to navigate. Perceived benefits included increased behavioral and emotional awareness with some YEH reporting a decrease in their high-risk behaviors as a result of participation. Another significant perceived benefit was the ability to use the phones for social support and make connections to family, friends, and potential employers. Barriers were primarily survey and technology related. Survey-related barriers included the redundancy of questions, the lack of customizable responses, and the timing of survey prompts. Technology-related barriers included the ""freezing""of the app, battery charge, and connectivity issues. Recommendations for future studies included the need to provide real-time mental health support for symptomatic youth, to create individually customized questions, and to test the use of personalized motivational messages that respond to the EMA data in real time. Conclusions: YEH are highly receptive to the use of EMA in studies. Further studies are warranted to understand the impact of EMA on YEH behaviors. Incorporating the YEH perspective into the design and implementation of EMA studies may help minimize barriers, increase acceptability, and improve participation rates in this hard-to-reach, disconnected population.  © 2021 Darlene Acorda, Michael Businelle, Diane Santa Maria.",2021,,JMIR Form.

Share our stories: An exploration of the healthcare experiences of child sex trafficking survivors,"Wallace, C.; Lavina, I.; Mollen, C.","Background: The trafficking of children and adolescents is widespread, and pediatric providers are on the front line. Current research demonstrates that trafficked children do access health care. However, few studies describe these interactions from their perspectives. In order to elucidate the healthcare experiences of sex trafficked children, we designed a qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews to explore their health care interactions. Participants and setting: Homeless youth currently aged 18–21 who were sex trafficked before age 18. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seventeen youth who met the study criteria. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using constant comparative methods. Themes were inductively extracted by consensus with the study team, and thematic saturation was determined when no new themes emerged. Results: Themes included: victims endured serious injuries and illnesses without being brought to medical attention, traffickers limited victims’ access to care, logistical barriers limited access, traffickers directed victims to lie to providers, and medical providers rarely separated victims to interview them separately resulting in missed opportunities. Conclusions: These themes illustrate the experiences of sex trafficked youth experiencing homelessness and provide pediatric practitioners the opportunity to become more informed and equipped to recognize them. They also highlight serious health consequences of not being identified and egregious examples of providers exhibiting denial or inappropriate responses to their disclosure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child Abuse Negl.,112,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104896,,#1318,Wallace 2021,,

Homelessness youth and mental health service utilization: A long-term follow-up study,"Russell, M.; Soong, W.; Nicholls, C.; Griffiths, J.; Curtis, K.; Follett, D.; Smith, W.; Waters, F.","Background: There is currently an incomplete picture of the long-term impact of homelessness on youth with mental health issues. There are also questions regarding homelessness as a predictor of mental health re-admissions. Aims: To examine the mental health service presentation profile of young people affected by homelessness and mental health issues. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of the medical records of homeless (n = 29) and non-homeless (n = 32) youth who attended the YouthLink specialist mental health service in 2010. We tracked their pattern of mental health service admissions at five time points during a total period of 10 years, including 2 years prior to, and up to 8 years following the YouthLink presentation. A regression analysis was used to examine factors hypothesized to contribute to mental health re-admissions. Results: Homeless youth had significantly more frequent presentations to inpatient and outpatient mental health services, and emergency departments for mental health reasons. They were 11 times more likely to be re-admitted to a mental health inpatient ward than non-homeless youth. Prior hospital admission was an independent predictor, increasing by a factor of 2.2 for every inpatient admission.

A commentary on the impact of COVID-19 on engagement of youth with substance use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders,"Bagley, S.M.; Hadland, S.E.; Yule, A.M.","Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with substance use disorders (SUD) have low rates of engagement and retention in SUD treatment (Mericle et al., 2015). Engagement and retention refers to treatment attendance and regular communication with providers. The reason for this low rate is multifactorial and includes the stigma surrounding SUD and treatment (Bagley, Hadland, Carney, & Saitz, 2017), and challenges accessing developmentally appropriate treatment (Mericle et al., 2015; Sterling, Weisner, Hinman, & Parthasarathy, 2010). Yet engaging AYA early in their trajectory of substance use offers an invaluable opportunity to minimize the short-term and long-term consequences of use (Compton et al., 2019; Levy, Williams, & Prevention, C. on S. U. A., 2016). As specialists in pediatric addiction, we made significant changes in how we provide care for youth in treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wearable Technologies for Children with Chronic Illnesses: An Exploratory Approach,"McErlane, F.; Davies, E.H.; Ollivier, C.; Mayhew, A.; Anyanwu, O.; Harbottle, V.; Donald, A.","Objective: To determine the utility of wearable technologies in physical activity assessment in three paediatric diseases, namely, Niemann-Pick C (NP-C), Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Design: Exploratory study Setting and Patients: Thirty children were recruited across three UK hospitals (Royal Manchester’s Children Hospital, Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital, and the Great North Children’s Hospital). Ten were diagnosed with NP-C, eight with DMD and twelve with JIA. Intervention: All participants completed the 6-min walk test (6MWT) at enrolment. Patients were provided with disease-specific smartphone apps paired with a wearable device via Bluetooth. Ambulation was recorded in 30-min epochs measuring average daily maximum (ADM), average daily steps (ADS) and average daily steps per 30-min epoch (ASE). Results: Median 6MWT results were 450 m, 325 m and 434.5 m for the NP-C, DMD and JIA cohorts, respectively. Wearable data capture was feasible in all three disease cohorts, although complete data capture was not sustained. A statistically significant between-cohort difference was identified for ADM, ADS and ASE. Statistically significant differences were found between DMD/JIA for ADM; NP-C/DMD for ADS and DMD/JIA for ASE. Discussion: Wearable sensor technologies have the potential to provide additional information for our understanding of ambulation in chronic paediatric disease. The wearable devices were easy to use and popular with patients although key features need to be addressed to appropriately meet study objectives. As the technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, opportunities to implement child friendly solutions are already available. © 2021, The Drug Information Association, Inc.",2021,,Ther. Innov.

Resilience Factors in Youth Transitioning Out of Foster Care: A Systematic Review,"Nuñez, M.; Beal, S.J.; Jacquez, F.","Objective: Youth who emancipate from the foster care system often experience poor outcomes during their transition into independent living (e.g., criminal justice involvement and homelessness). Yet, some youth are resilient and achieve positive outcomes. The purpose of this study is to review the resilience factors identified in the literature for youth transitioning out of care. Method: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PsycINFO, PubMed, and EMBASE databases. A total of 12 studies met our inclusion criteria. Results: A total of 38 different resilience factors were identified across the studies reviewed. From these resilience factors, 18 were statistically significant, including four assets and 14 resources. Conclusion: Understanding the assets and resources that promote resilience can aid clinicians in assessing and capitalizing on youths’ strengths and can help researchers develop effective interventions and target gaps in the literature. Further, it can assist policymakers in generating legislation to improve outcomes for foster youth transitioning out of care.

Who stays in medication treatment for opioid use disorder? A national study of outpatient specialty treatment settings,"Krawczyk, N.; Williams, A.R.; Saloner, B.; Cerdá, M.","Background: Maintenance treatments with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are highly effective at reducing overdose risk while patients remain in care. However, few patients initiate medication and retention remains a critical challenge across settings. Much remains to be learned about individual and structural factors that influence successful retention, especially among populations dispensed MOUD in outpatient settings. Methods: We examined individual and structural characteristics associated with MOUD treatment retention among a national sample of adults seeking MOUD treatment in outpatient substance use treatment settings using the 2017 Treatment Episode Dataset-Discharges (TEDS-D). The study assessed predictors of retention in MOUD using multivariate logistic regression and accelerated time failure models. Results: Of 130,300 episodes of MOUD treatment in outpatient settings, 36% involved a duration of care greater than six months. The strongest risk factors for treatment discontinuation by six months included being of younger age, ages 18–29 ((OR):0.52 [95%CI:0.50–0.54]) or 30–39 (OR:0.57 [95%CI:0.55–0.59); experiencing homelessness (OR: 0.70 [95%CI:0.66–0.73]); co-using methamphetamine (OR:0.48 [95%CI:0.45–0.51]); and being referred to treatment by a criminal justice source (OR:0.55 [95%CI:0.52–0.59) or by a school, employer, or community source (OR:0.71 [95%CI:0.66–0.76). Conclusions: Improving retention in treatment is a pivotal stage in the OUD cascade of care and is critical to reducing overdose deaths. Efforts should prioritize interventions to improve retention among patients who are both prescribed and dispended MOUD, especially youth, people experiencing homelessness, polysubstance users, and people referred to care by the justice system who have especially short stays in care. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,,J.

"Brief report: Youth homelessness, youthful caregiving, and resilience","Frederick, T.J.; Vitopoulos, N.; Stamatopoulos, V.; Kidd, S.A.","Research on young people experiencing homelessness often emphasizes the role of abuse, neglect, and rejection from guardians in the process of pushing or forcing young people out of the home. More recently, the research has begun to pay attention to how parents and other family members can remain a part of a young person's network throughout their homelessness trajectory. Nevertheless, within this literature, questions remain about the impact of ongoing family dynamics on youths’ potential pathways through homelessness. This paper aims to focus on one type of family dynamic in particular, that of the young caregiver experiencing homelessness. The analysis uses interviews with five young people with histories of young caring and homelessness to stimulate future research on how youthful caregiving intersects with the experience of housing instability and youth homelessness. The paper focuses on three main themes: insights into the nature of the family dynamic and the caregiving relationship, discussions about the burden associated with the care relationship, and themes about resilience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child.

Foster youth and at-risk non-foster youth: A propensity score and structural equation modeling analysis,"Hobbs, S.D.; Bederian-Gardner, D.; Ogle, C.M.; Bakanosky, S.; Narr, R.; Goodman, G.S.","Foster youth and youth who grow up in poverty are at risk for experiencing difficulties in adulthood. However, youth in foster care may be at a greater disadvantage due to additional stressors associated with being removed from home and placed into care. Much of the research assessing outcomes associated with foster care compare foster youth to other youth in care or to youth in the general population. In the current study, we used propensity scores and careful sampling to closely match a sample of 17-year-old foster youth (N = 332) with a group of 17-year-old high-risk youth (N = 83) who had not experienced foster care to evaluate them on risk and protective factors associated with various outcomes in adulthood. A well-fitting structural equation model (SEM) indicated that compared to high risk youth who have never been in foster care, youth in foster care experience higher rates of incarceration, homelessness, early parenthood, and referral to drug and/or alcohol treatment as well as lower levels of education attainment. An interaction between foster care status and gender significantly predicted incarceration. Males in foster care were more likely to experience incarceration compared to other youth. These experiences predict further difficulties in adulthood. Implications for youth currently in care are discussed. © 2021",2021,,Child. Youth Serv.

"Associations of lifetime prevalence of homelessness with risky sex, sexual victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality among youth in Kampala, Uganda","Lyons, M.; Swahn, M.H.; Whitaker, D.; Brown, J.R.; Kasper, J.; Culbreth, R.","Homelessness poses serious health risks, and those risks may be exacerbated among slum-dwelling youth in the developing world. We administered a cross-sectional survey to youth receiving services from a community organization in Kampala, Uganda. This secondary analysis explores the relationships between homelessness and various health outcomes. We also explored possible moderating relationships between neighborhood support, homelessness, and health. Logistic regression and t-tests were used to model these relationships. Homelessness was associated with all outcomes analyzed, with youth who reported having been homeless having higher odds of reporting poor health (odds ratio [OR] = 12.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.43, 23.92), higher odds of HIV infection (OR = 1.941; 95% CI = 1.274, 2.958), and higher odds of experiencing rape (OR = 3.459; 95% CI = 2.4, 4.987). No moderation by neighborhood support was observed, though this may be due to low variability. Homelessness warrants specific investigative attention due to its strong association with a broad range of negative health outcomes among slum-dwelling youth. Interventions targeting the specific health risks faced by homeless youth in the developing world may improve social welfare service delivery. © The Author(s) 2019.",2021,,Int. Soc.

Integrating trauma-informed care and collective impact: Perspectives of service providers working with cross-system youth,"Ball, A.; Bowen, E.A.; Semanchin Jones, A.","Objective: Organizations have adopted trauma-informed care (TIC) to guide service provision for vulnerable populations. There is little research, however, on TIC in cross-system collaborations. The collective impact (CI) framework offers insight into cross-system collaboration, but there are few studies on CI, and none have examined it in relationship to TIC. This paper proposes the use of an aligned TIC and CI framework and presents findings from a qualitative study as an illustrative example. Method: We conducted focus groups and interviews with 35 homeless services, child welfare, and school social work providers working with cross-system youth (i.e., youth involved in multiple social systems). We used inductive and deductive approaches to analyze data and identify how providers incorporate TIC and CI in their practice to serve cross-system youth. Results: Findings emphasized the widespread adoption of TIC among social service organizations, as well as providers’ aspirational conceptions of CI. Providers also stressed the importance of trust in cross-system collaboration and the need for sufficient resources. Conclusions: Providers felt a need for CI but also identified constraints that limited the alignment of TIC and CI in practice. Findings hold implications for practice and policy to address trauma through multisystem collaboration. © 2021 by the Society for Social Work and Research. All rights reserved.",2021,,J. Soc. Soc.

Tuberculosis in adolescents and young adults: Emerging data on tb transmission and prevention among vulnerable young people,"Laycock, K.M.; Enane, L.A.; Steenhoff, A.P.","Adolescents and young adults (AYA, ages 10–24 years) comprise a uniquely important but understudied population in global efforts to end tuberculosis (TB), the leading infectious cause of death by a single agent worldwide prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While TB prevention and care strategies often overlook AYA by grouping them with either children or adults, AYA have particular physiologic, developmental, and social characteristics that require dedicated approaches. This review describes current evidence on the prevention and control of TB among AYA, including approaches to TB screening, dynamics of TB transmission among AYA, and management challenges within the context of unique developmental needs. Challenges are considered for vulnerable groups of AYA such as migrants and refugees; AYA experiencing homelessness, incarceration, or substance use; and AYA living with HIV.

"Variation in Health Among Unstably Housed Youth From Cities, Suburbs, Towns, and Rural Areas","Gewirtz O'Brien, J.R.; Gower, A.L.; McRee, A.-L.","Purpose: Youth face similar rates of homelessness across rural and urban areas, yet little is known about how the health of unstably housed youth varies by location. We assessed differences in health by location (city, suburb, town, and rural) and housing status among youth facing a range of unstable housing experiences. Methods: This secondary data analysis from 8th, 9th, and 11th graders completing the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey examined youth who had experienced housing instability in the prior year (n = 10,757), including running away (48%) or experiencing homelessness (staying in shelter, couch-surfing, or rough sleeping) with (42%) or without (10%) an adult family member. We conducted multifactor analysis of variance to assess differences by location (urban, suburban, town, and rural) and housing experience for each of five health indicators: suboptimal health, depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, ≥2 sexual partners, and e-cigarette use. Results: In main effects models, all health indicators varied based on housing status; suboptimal health, ≥2 sexual partners, and e-cigarette use also varied by location. Interaction models showed that unaccompanied homeless youth in suburbs reported poorer health compared with those in cities. Compared with suburbs, youth in towns were more likely to report ≥2 sexual partners (19.9%, 24.1%) and e-cigarette use (39.5%, 43.3%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that unstably housed youth face a similar burden of poor health across locations, with only subtle differences in health indicators, yet most research focuses on urban youth. Future research is needed to identify how to best meet the health needs of unstably housed youth across locations. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2021,,J. Adolesc.

An evaluation of My Strengths Training for Life™ for improving resilience and well-being of young people experiencing homelessness,"Quinton, M.L.; Clarke, F.J.; Parry, B.J.; Cumming, J.","This community-based study investigated whether (1) a novel sport psychology informed positive youth development program, My Strengths Training for Life™, improved resilience and well-being and (2) young people differed in outcomes according to demographics (gender, ethnicity, social inclusion, and learning difficulty). A total of 246 young people (M age = 19.74, SD = 2.31) living in a large housing service completed questionnaires on demographics, mental skills, and pre and postprogram resilience and well-being. Baseline differences in resilience and well-being existed for ethnicity and learning difficulty status but did not influence MST4Life™ outcomes. There was a significant improvement in resilience and well-being over time, which was associated with mental skills development. Implications apply for policy, program commissioners, and research: (1) novel sport psychology interventions can improve the well-being of disadvantaged youth, and (2) demographics at baseline should be considered in intervention planning and evaluation with this population. © 2021 The Authors.

"Risky Sexual Behavior and Associated Factors among Street Youth in Dilla Town, Gedeo Zone, South Ethiopia, 2018","Fikre, S.; Tenkolu, G.; Mamo, Z.B.","Background: Street youth are exposed to situations that make them vulnerable to sexual and reproductive health problems. The majority of street youth are living in conditions of severe deprivation, which place them at all kinds of health risks. Street youth have risky sexual behaviors that increase the likelihood of adverse sexual and reproductive health consequences. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the prevalence and associated factors of risky sexual behavior among street youth in Dilla town, Gedeo zone, South Ethiopia, 2018. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 279randomly selected street youth after locating and identifying them through census using a structured pre-tested questionnaire. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses were used. Statistically significant was declared at alpha<0.05. Results: The prevalence of risky sexual behavior among street youth in Dilla town was53.9% (95% CI -(48, 60.2)). Female sex (AOR=9.57, 95% CI- (1.76, 52.07)), age (AOR=1.23, 95% CI-(1.08, 1.39)), educational level (AOR=3.00, 95% CI- (1.08, 8.33)) and alcohol intake (AOR=2.27, 95% CI - (1.11, 4.68)) were statistically significant with risky sexual behavior. Conclusion: A substantial number of street youths were engagedin risky sexual behavior, while female sex, increase in age, educational level, and alcohol intake of street youth were found to contribute to aggravate the problem. This calls formobilizing interventions considering the above factors to bring behavioral change in reducing risky sexual practices. © 2021 Simret Fikre, et al.",2021,,Ethiop J Health Sci,31,5,947-954,,10.4314/ejhs.v31i5.5,,#1357,Fikre 2021,,
Shining a light on the experiences of staff working with young homeless people: A grounded theory study,"Peters, L.; Samuel, V.M.; Hobson, C.W.","Young people experiencing homelessness represent one of the most vulnerable groups in society. Research which has considered staff experience, has highlighted the importance of the interaction between the workers and the homeless young people. Very few studies have considered the emotional impact of the support worker role in young people's homeless services. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological and practical coping skills staff employ to negotiate the demands of their roles, with a focus on how staff work to develop supportive relationships with young homeless people with complex trauma histories. Eleven staff (5 male, 6 female) participated in this research. All the participants were Support Workers employed by the same organisation, supporting youth experiencing homelessness across two urban areas of Wales. Participants engaged in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences. Data was analysed adopting a Grounded Theory approach. Seven main concepts were identified in the analysis: the need to be “a certain kind of person”; the rewards and challenges of the role; the impact of the organisational context and culture; individual approaches to coping; possible adverse impacts of the role; enjoyment of the role; and personal growth. The interaction between these concepts was considered and conveyed via a proposed model. A theory of balance was developed within which a pivotal process was the fluctuation between feeling supported by the organisation and coping well and feeling unsupported and struggling to cope. It is hoped that the findings from this research will directly inform clinical practice regarding psychologically based interventions for staff in settings for young people experiencing homelessness and be a valuable contribution to the scarce research literature on services for young homeless people. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child.

A critical discussion of the use of film in participatory research projects with homeless young people: an analysis based on case examples from England and Canada,"Roy, A.; Kennelly, J.; Rowley, H.; Larkins, C.","The focus of this paper is on the complex and sometimes contradictory effects of generating films with and about young people who have experienced homelessness, through participatory research. Drawing on two projects – one in Ottawa, Canada, and the other in Manchester, UK – we scrutinise two key aspects of participatory research projects that use film: first, how to appropriately communicate the complexity of already-stigmatised lives to different publics, and second, which publics we prioritise, and how this shapes the stories that are told. Through a theoretical framework that combines Pierre Bourdieu’s account of authorised language with Arthur Frank’s socio-narratology, we analyse the potential for generating justice versus reproducing symbolic violence through participatory research and film with homeless young people. In particular, we scrutinise the distinct role played by what we are calling first, second and third publics – each with their own level of distance and relationship to the participatory research process. © The Author(s) 2020.",2021,,Qual.

"Demographic and behavioural drivers of intra-urban mobility of migrant street children and youth in Kampala, Uganda","Bwambale, M.F.; Bukuluki, P.; Moyer, C.A.; van den Borne, B.H.W.","While research on the nexus of migration and wellbeing of individuals has gained recognition in recent years, far less attention has been devoted to intra-urban mobility especially among the urban poor young populations. We assess the drivers of intra-urban mobility using a random sample of 412 migrant street children and youth in Kampala city, Uganda. This paper draws from a larger cross-sectional survey of circular migration and sexual and reproductive health choices among street children in Kampala, Uganda. We define ‘migrants’ as street children and youth with a rural-urban migration experience and ‘intra-urban mobility’ as the number of places stayed in or moved since migrating to the city, measured on a continuous scale. More than half (54.37%) of the migrant street children and youth had lived in two or more places since migrating to the city. Multivariate negative binomial regression analysis reveals migrant street children and youth’s intra-urban mobility to be associated with gender (aIRR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.53–0.96), sex work (aIRR = 1.38, 95%CI 1.01–1.88), a daily income of one USD or more (aIRR = 1.57, 95%CI 1.16–2.13) and duration of stay in the city (aIRR = 1.54, 95%CI 1.17–2.01). Other drivers of intra-urban mobility included availability of causal work, personal safety and affordability of rental costs. Our findings suggest the need for urban housing and health policies to take into account street children and youth’s intra-urban mobility and its drivers. Future research on all drivers of street children and youth’s intra-urban mobility and its linkage with their health outcomes is recommended. © 2021 Bwambale et al.

A Scoping Review on Access and Use of Technology in Youth Experiencing Homelessness: Implications for Healthcare,"Lal, S.; Halicki-Asakawa, A.; Fauvelle, A.","Introduction: Youth are among the fastest growing subset of the homeless population. Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face multiple barriers in accessing health information and health care services. As such, they may best be reached through information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, limited efforts have been made to synthesize literature on this topic. In this paper, we review studies on access and use of ICTs among YEH. We also discuss the implications of the review for healthcare. Methods: Using scoping review methodology, we searched four databases (Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL) for studies published between 2005 and 2019, screening 1,927 titles and abstracts. Results: We identified 19 articles reporting on studies with YEH between the ages of 12-30, the majority of which were published in the USA. On average, more than half of the samples owned smartphones, used social media, and accessed the internet weekly to search for housing, employment, health information, and to communicate with family, peers, and health workers; however, many youths faced barriers to sustaining their access to technology. Benefits of using ICTs were connecting with home-based peers, family, and case workers, which was associated with a reduction in substance use, risky sexual health behaviors, and severity of mental health symptoms. Connecting with negative, street-based social ties was identified as the most common risk factor to using ICTs due to its association with engaging in risky sex behaviors and substance abuse. Discussion: This review supports the advancement of research and practice on using ICTs to deliver public health information and health services to YEH, while also considering the health-related risks, benefits, and barriers that YEH face when accessing ICTs.

Social Problem-Solving and Suicidal Ideation Among Homeless Youth Receiving a Cognitive Therapy Intervention: A Moderated Mediation Analysis,"Zhang, J.; Wu, Q.; Slesnick, N.","Despite the high prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among homeless youth, little research has examined how suicide prevention interventions influence suicide-related risk and protective factors, and ultimately produce positive outcome in suicidality in this population. Drawing on the Diathesis-Stress Model and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, the current study examined whether participation in Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) moderated the mediation link between social problem-solving, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation among a sample of homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation. Social problem-solving refers to a set of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping responses in the face of stressful situations, and it is identified as a potent protective factor in alleviating perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and reducing suicidal ideation. Participants included 150 homeless youth (M age = 20.99, range = 18-24; 41% female) who were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 75) or Treatment as Usual alone (n = 75). Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings showed that perceived burdensomeness mediated the association of social problem-solving with suicidal ideation only among youth participating in the CTSP condition. These findings provide evidence to support the promising effects of CTSP in enhancing the protective effects of social problem-solving on suicidal ideation through the mediating effects of perceived burdensomeness. Findings also have implications for improving intervention effectiveness with a community-based population at high risk of suicide. © 2020",2021,,Behav.

"Mobilizing affect, shaping market subjects: Tracing the connections of neuroliberalism and social finance in youth homelessness projects","Wirth, M.","In this article, I take the framework of neuroliberalism as an analytical lens to explore the functioning and implementation of a social impact bond-funded welfare service for young homeless people in the UK. After reflecting on the lines of connections and divergences between social impact bonds and neuroliberal logics, I draw attention to the limitations that exist in welfare interventions inspired by neuroliberal thought. On the one hand, the studied intervention functioned mainly through designing trustful, ideal-type relationships as a means to ‘fix’ people, thereby focusing on behavioural and biographical deficiencies and spreading good life ideals of a marketized world. On the other hand, I demonstrate how this focus on adjusting micro-contexts and tinkering with the affective, relational infrastructure fails to understand systemic constraints. Those were particularly evident with regard to the precarious labour market environment and colliding welfare agendas individuals were confronted with. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Environ. Plann.

Birth Control Access and Selection among Youths Experiencing Homelessness in the United States: A Review,"Aparicio, E.M.; Kachingwe, O.N.; Fleishman, J.; Novick, J.","Youths experiencing homelessness (YEH) become pregnant at five times the general population rate. Education, social, and health care systems struggle to adequately address this young community’s sexual and reproductive health needs, yet social workers are well positioned across sectors to address their sexual and reproductive health and well-being. A growing body of literature exists on the factors affecting YEH’s access and selection of birth control, prompting the present review that aimed to understand this process and inform better attuned sexual and reproductive health approaches. Using a systematic search and analytic approach, we retrieved 203 articles, of which 23 met inclusion criteria. Key findings emerged across socioecological levels, including barriers and facilitators to condom use; the differential impact on YEH of hormonal birth control side effects; and the devastating effects of economic insecurity leading to sexual exploitation, survival sex, and exposure to violence. Implications include the need for multilevel intervention that addresses youths’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavior as well the need to improve social norms and system design to provide better attuned care for YEH.

The psychological impact of childhood homelessness—a literature review,"D’Sa, S.; Foley, D.; Hannon, J.; Strashun, S.; Murphy, A.-M.; O’Gorman, C.","In August 2019, 3848 children in Ireland were faced with emergency homelessness [1]. In recent years, lack of affordable housing, unemployment and shortage of rental properties have been the primary driving factors for the potentially devastating impact of familial homelessness in our society [1]. Our aim was to evaluate current knowledge on the psychological impact of homelessness in children. Using the PRISMA model, we performed a review of the currently available literature on the psychological impact of homelessness on children. This concept was explored under two different categories—‘transgenerational’ and ‘new-onset homelessness’. Hidden homelessness was also explored. Our literature review revealed several psychological morbidities which were unique to children. This includes developmental and learning delays, behavioural difficulties and increased levels of anxiety and depression [66, 77, 40, 81, 42]. This has been demonstrated by poorer performance in school testing and increased levels of aggression. Anxiety in children within this cohort has been shown to peak at time of dispersion from their stable home environment [67]. Our study highlights violence, aggression and poor academic learning outcomes to be just some of the key findings in our review of homelessness in childhood, worldwide. Unfortunately, there has been minimum research to date on paediatric homelessness within the context of the Irish population.

Participants were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention + treatment as usual through a local drop-in center (CTSP + TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75), and treatment attendance among those assigned to CTSP + TAU was examined in this study. As expected, among youth engaged in CTSP + TAU, those with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) showed decreased odds of treatment attendance. Additionally, youth randomized into CTSP + TAU with higher acquired capability for suicide (ACS) scores and those identifying as Black were more likely to attend treatment sessions.

The Sexuality of Disabled Bodies and Individuals with Disability in South Africa's Comprehensive Sexuality Education Scripted Lesson Plans,"Ubisi, L.","Local research has utilized both practical (youth with disabilities accessing sexual and reproductive health services) and theoretical knowledge (decoloniality, disability and sexuality) to understand the sexuality of persons living with disabilities. However, this knowledge has not been utilized to examine the visibility of disability and sexuality in South Africa's comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) scripted lesson plans (SLPs). A content analysis was conducted of all the Department of Basic Education's CSE SLPs (Grades 4–12). The study indicated that only in Grade 10 is disability and sexuality discussed in 3 activities. Within these activities, some attempt has been made to demystify certain misconceptions about the sexuality of disabled bodies (i.e. as celibate, asexual beings, with no romantic or sexual interests). The activities further debunk how various types of disabled bodies are sexual beings (i.e. not just those in wheelchairs). However, the fact that these discourses only emerge and left in Grade 10, raises concerns about the inclusivity of the CSE curriculum for disabled youth (e.g. CSE not acknowledging issues of power and consent amongst youth living with disabilities).

Segmenting or Summing the Parts? A Scoping Review of Male Suicide Research in Canada,"Oliffe, J.L.; Kelly, M.T.; Montaner, G.G.; Links, P.S.; Kealy, D.; Ogrodniczuk, J.S.","Objective: Suicide in Canadian men is high and rising. Research consistently indicates increased suicide risk in male subgroups including sexual minority, Indigenous, middle-aged, and military men. The current scoping review addresses the research question: Among male subgroups featured in Canadian suicide research, what are the key findings to inform suicide prevention efforts?. Method: A scoping review was undertaken in accord with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Structured searches were conducted in CIHAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to identify studies reporting suicidality (suicidal ideation, plans and/or attempts) and suicide among men in Canada. Inclusion criteria comprised primary empirical studies featuring Canadian male subgroups published in English from 2009 to 2020 inclusive. Results: Sixty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria, highlighting significant rates of male suicidality and/or suicide in 3 categories: (1) health inequities (n = 29); (2) age-specific (n = 30); and (3) occupation (n = 9). The health inequities category included sexual minority men, Indigenous, and other marginalized males (i.e., homeless, immigrant men, and men who use opiates). Age-specific men focused on adolescents and youth, and middle-aged and older males. Active military, veterans, and first responders featured in the occupation category. Studies compared at risk male subgroups to females, general male populations, and/or other marginalized groups in emphasizing mental health disparities and increased suicide risk. Some men’s suboptimal connections to existing mental health care services were also highlighted. Conclusion: While male subgroups who are vulnerable to suicidality and suicide were consistently described, these insights have not translated to tailored upstream suicide prevention services for Canadian boys and men. There may be some important gains through integrating social and mental health care services for marginalized men, implementing school-based masculinity programs for adolescent males, orientating clinicians to the potential for men’s mid-life suicide risks (i.e., separation, bereavement, retirement) and lobbying employers to norm help-seeking among activate military, veterans, and first responder males. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Can.

Preventing youth homelessness through social procurement in construction: A capability empowerment approach,"Loosemore, M.; Bridgeman, J.; Russell, H.; Alkilani, S.Z.","Homelessness is a serious and growing problem in the UK, exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis. The latest figures estimate that 160,000 households are at risk of the worst forms of homelessness. Employment is widely recognised as being critical to reducing homelessness, yet there has been no research into the role that the construction industry, as a major UK employer, can play in reducing this problem. The aim of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge and contribute to the emerging social procurement debate in construction by exploring the role that construction employment can play in reducing the risk of homelessness. Mobilising Sen’s and Nussbaum’s capabilities empowerment approach, an in-depth case study is presented of a construction employment program in Wales, UK, which was aimed at supporting young people who had experienced or who were at risk of homelessness. Contributing to the emerging social value and social procurement debate in construction and drawing on documentary analysis and interviews with young people who were homeless or at risk of homelessness who went through the program, findings indicate that these young people became empowered in ways which reduced their risk of homelessness. It is concluded that the capabilities empowerment framework is valuable in explaining how employment in the construction industry can reduce the risks of homelessness for disadvantaged youth with a care-experienced background or who were known to the criminal justice system. © 2021 by the authors.

Trends in homelessness and injection practices among young urban and suburban people who inject drugs: 1997-2017,"Hotton, A.; Mackesy-Amiti, M.-E.; Boodram, B.","Background: Among young people who inject drugs (PWID) homelessness is associated with numerous adverse psychosocial and health consequences, including risk of relapse and overdose, psychological distress and suicidality, limited treatment access, and injection practices that increase the risk of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. Homeless PWID may also be less likely to access sterile syringes through pharmacies or syringe service programs. Methods: This study applied random-effects meta-regression to examine trends over time in injection risk behaviors and homelessness among young PWID in Chicago and surrounding suburban and rural areas using data from 11 studies collected between 1997 and 2017. In addition, subject-level data were pooled to evaluate the effect of homelessness on risk behaviors across all studies using mixed effects logistic and negative binomial regression with random study effects. Results: There was a significant increase in homelessness among young PWID over time, consistent with the general population trend of increasing youth homelessness. In mixed-effects regression, homelessness was associated with injection risk behaviors (receptive syringe sharing, syringe mediated sharing, equipment sharing) and exchange sex, though we detected no overall changes in risk behavior over time. Conclusions: Increases over time in homelessness among young PWID highlight a need for research to understand factors contributing to youth homelessness to inform HIV/STI, HCV, and overdose prevention and intervention services for this population. © 2021",2021,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,225,,,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108797,,#1386,Hotton 2021,,
Self-Esteem and Resilience Differences Among Street Children Compared to Non-street Children in Limpopo Province of South Africa: A Baseline Study,"Maepa, M.P.","The phenomenon of street children is a challenging global social problem. Using an independent sample group design, this study explored the differences in self-esteem and resilience among street children and non-street children. A total of 300 (N = 300) street children with ages ranging from 8 to 18 years were selected using a purposive sampling method, while a total of 300 (N = 300) non-street children with ages ranging from 8 to 18 years were selected using a simple random sample to participate in this study. A questionnaire with three sections was used to collect data. Results of an independent sample t-test revealed that street children reported low self-esteem and poor resilience compared to non-street children. The study, therefore, concluded that street children and non-street children differ on self-esteem and resilience. It is recommended that social skills training be provided for the street children population. © Copyright © 2021 Maepa.",2021,,Front. Public Health,9,,,,10.3389/fpubh.2021.542778,,#1393,Maepa 2021,,
An analysis of pedestrian crash trends and contributing factors in Texas,"Bernhardt, M.; Kockelman, K.","Introduction & research objectives: Pedestrian crash rates and deaths have risen across the United States over the past decade, in contrast to motor vehicle traffic crash counts and rates. Analysis of pedestrian crash rates per vehicle-mile traveled and walk-mile traveled (VMT and WMT) illuminates the impacts of homelessness, land development densities, income, weather, and many other variables across the State of Texas, helping to propel more effective safety policies. Methods: This study examines key factors for and countermeasures against pedestrian crashes, while predicting pedestrian crash rates per VMT and WMT, as sourced from the Texas DOT (TxDOT) and the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) add-on sample. Crash data from TxDOT's Crash Records Information System (CRIS) database were analyzed using an ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression by controlling for a variety of socioeconomic, climate, and roadway design variables, including homelessness, which has emerged as a serious issue along freeway rights-of-way in many U.S. urban areas. Results: At the county level in Texas, there is a moderately positive relationship between job density and pedestrian crash rates, but a practically significant and negative relationship with population density. Median income and homelessness have very practically significant, positive impacts on pedestrian crash and fatality rates. For example, a 1 standard deviation increase in homelessness per 1000 residents is associated with a +14.4% of 1 standard deviation rise in the total pedestrian crash rate per WMT at the county level, all else constant. Similarly, pedestrian crashes per WMT rise in a notable way with the share of children under age 17 and rates of homelessness. Conclusions: These results suggest significant positive relationships between pedestrian crash rates per VMT and per WMT with respect to household incomes and homelessness, at the county level. Pedestrian crashes and pedestrian deaths per WMT also reveal practically significant contributions by larger youth populations and poverty rates. A weaker but still practically significant relationship exists between crash rates per VMT and population growth rate, warranting further investigation on the relationship between exurban land use patterns and pedestrian crashes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,J.

An unmet need for paediatric LGBTQ training,"Roth, L.T.; Garcia, M.; Soren, K.; Catallozzi, M.","Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth have increased health risks, exacerbated by discrimination and lack of provider training. Currently, no graduate medical education requirements address the need for LGBTQ health training, particularly for paediatric providers. We aimed to perform a needs assessment of provider knowledge, comfort and awareness of community resources regarding LGBTQ youth. Methods: We administered two anonymous surveys from May to October 2017. The first survey of 73 residents assessed awareness of community resources and comfort providing referrals. A second survey of 110 trainees and faculty assessed comfort and knowledge regarding paediatric LGBTQ health. Results: In the first survey of residents regarding community resources (n = 30, 41% response rate), most did not know where to refer LGBTQ patients for mental health care (67%), transgender care (73%), support groups (87%), emergency shelters (86%) or family resources (87%). Ninety-seven per cent would refer to the social worker. In the second survey of trainees and faculty (n = 78, 71% response rate), most had little or no knowledge regarding pre-exposure prophylaxis (60%), post-exposure prophylaxis (54%), strategies for coming out (68%), homelessness/environmental risks (59%), gender dysphoria (63%), puberty blockade (77%), hormonal (78%) and surgical (81%) transitioning, domestic violence (58%), EMR logistics (89%) and community resources (80%). Only 33% felt very comfortable eliciting a history about sexual orientation, 13% about gender identity and 14% about sexual practices. Conclusion: There is a clear need and desire for dedicated paediatric LGBTQ health training in graduate medical education.

Planning the Future in an Uncertain Present: Postsecondary Possibilities for Accompanied Youth of Color Experiencing Homelessness,"Pavlakis, A.E.; Pryor, K.N.","Research suggests diverse experiences with homelessness can affect students’ PK-12 school success and, relatedly, postsecondary opportunities. Exploring postsecondary preparation and planning in the context of housing instability, this study draws on the framework of community cultural wealth to explore the lived experiences of accompanied Students of Color undergoing homelessness. Part of a larger qualitative case study on homelessness and a community-based afterschool center, this study draws mainly from interviews and focus groups with 21 students experiencing homelessness and 10 program providers. These data reveal students’ assets and future aspirations despite formidable structural challenges. Analysis suggests that these students have many assets to aid in postsecondary planning; afterschool programs and other stakeholders can and must amplify these strengths in myriad ways. Contributing to research on the diversity in homelessness, this study focuses purposefully and exclusively on the unique experiences of accompanied students persisting in high school—all of whom identify as Students of Color.

A nurse case management HIV prevention intervention (Come As You Are) for youth experiencing homelessness: Protocol for a randomized wait-list controlled trial,"Maria, D.S.; Lightfoot, M.; Nyamathi, A.; Businelle, M.; Paul, M.; Quadri, Y.; Padhye, N.; Jones, J.; Armijo, M.C.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness are more likely than housed youth to experience premature death, suicide, drug overdose, pregnancy, substance use, and mental illness. Yet while youth experiencing homelessness are 6 to 12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than housed youth, with HIV prevalence as high as 16%, many do not access the prevention services they need. Despite adversities, youth experiencing homelessness are interested in health promotion programs, can be recruited and retained in interventions and research studies, and demonstrate improved outcomes when programs are tailored and relevant to them. Objective: The study aims to compare the efficacy of a nurse case management HIV prevention and care intervention, titled Come As You Are, with that of usual care among youth experiencing homelessness aged 16 to 25 years. Methods: The study is designed as a 2-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. Participants (n=450) will be recruited and followed up for 9 months after the intervention for a total study period of 12 months. Come As You Are combines nurse case management with a smartphone-based daily ecological momentary assessment to develop participant-driven HIV prevention behavioral goals that can be monitored in real-time. Youth in the city of Houston, Texas will be recruited from drop-in centers, shelters, street outreach programs, youth-serving organizations, and clinics. Results: Institutional review board approval (Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston) was obtained in November 2018. The first participant was enrolled in November 2019. Data collection is ongoing. To date, 123 participants have consented to participate in the study, 89 have been enrolled, and 15 have completed their final follow-up. Conclusions: There is a paucity of HIV prevention research regarding youth experiencing homelessness. Novel and scalable interventions that address the full continuum of behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention are needed. This study will determine whether a personalized and mobile HIV prevention approach can reduce HIV risk among a hard-to-reach, transient population of youth at high risk. © Diane Santa Maria, Marguerita Lightfoot, Adey Nyamathi, Michael Businelle, Mary Paul, Yasmeen Quadri, Nikhil Padhye, Jennifer Jones, Margarita Calvo Armijo.

Negotiating racialised (un)belonging: Black LGBTQ resistance in Toronto’s gay village,"Rosenberg, R.D.","This article explores the ways in which homeless Black queer and trans youth embody and perform everyday acts of temporal and spatial resistance in Toronto’s gay village. By analysing interviews, mental maps and photographs from my research with homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2) youth, I present how homeless Black queer and trans youth counter the whiteness and anti-Black racism they frequently experience in the village through acts of remembering and placemaking. Specifically, I argue that despite the small-scale reach of the everyday resistance that manifests in our interviews, temporal and spatial resistance challenge the whitewashing of Toronto’s gay village, which is particularly crucial in a moment when the village is centred in conversations of anti-Black racism in the city’s queer community. Engaging in these forms of everyday resistance illustrates the ways in which homeless Black LGBTQ youth instruct their own placemaking in an otherwise uninhabitably racialised neighbourhood, shift narratives of their experiences in processes of knowledge production and spark processes of their own politicisation and community building. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.",2021,,Urban Stud.,58,7,1397-1413,,10.1177/0042098020914857,,#1403,Rosenberg 2021,,
Visual impairment and the prevalence of ocular pathology in homeless children and adults globally: a systematic review,"Sayal, A.P.; Slomovic, J.; Bhambra, N.S.; Popovic, M.M.; Lichter, M.","Background: Homelessness is a global issue in developing and developed countries. This article is the first systematic review to explore its impact on visual health globally. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Peer-reviewed English-language studies with a focus on homeless children or adults that reported on ocular outcomes were included. Primary outcomes and secondary endpoints were reported via weighted averages. Primary outcomes between homeless children and homeless adults were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results: There were 5774 individuals across 23 full-text articles included in the review. For studies reporting primary outcomes, 36.8% of homeless individuals self-reported dissatisfaction with their vision, 26.8% self-reported a previous ocular pathology, 26.3% had uncorrected refractive error, 25.6% were functionally visually impaired, 9.2% had at least one previous eye surgery or procedure, and 4.0% had nonrefractive visual impairment. Upon screening, 25.1% of homeless individuals had some type of ocular pathology, which included cornea and external eye diseases (13.4%), glaucoma (7.4%), cataracts (6.3%), retinal diseases (5.3%), ocular motility disorders (4.7%), trauma (2.3%), neuro-ophthalmological conditions (1.7%), and oculoplastic conditions (0.7%). Homeless adults had significantly more visual impairment (p < 0.001), uncorrected refractive error (p < 0.001), ocular pathology (p < 0.001), cataracts (p < 0.001), retinal pathology (p < 0.001), and neuro-ophthalmological conditions (p < 0.001) relative to children. Conclusions: Visual impairment in homeless individuals is higher than the general population. Uncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of visual impairment in this population. Additionally, homeless adults have significantly more visual impairment and ocular pathology than homeless children. Future studies should also explore if these differences are consistent in developing countries and investigate ways to increase eye care access for homeless individuals. © 2020 Canadian Ophthalmological Society",2021,,Can.

This analysis is based on a cross-sectional study of youth living in the slums of Kampala conducted in spring 2014 (N = 1,134). The participants (12–18 years of age) were attending Uganda Youth Development Link centers, which serve youth living on the streets and slums of Kampala. Bivariate and multivariable multinomial analyses were conducted to examine risk factors associated with IPV victimization only, IPV perpetration only, and both IPV victimization and perpetration compared with no IPV victimization or perpetration. Among youth who reported having a boyfriend or girlfriend (n = 600), 18.3% (n = 110) reported experiencing both IPV victimization and perpetration, 11.0% (n = 66) reported IPV perpetration only, 7.7% (n = 46) reported experiencing IPV victimization only, and 63.0% (n = 378) reported no IPV experiences. In the multivariable analysis, IPV victimization only was associated with witnessing parental IPV (odds ratio [OR] = 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.42, 5.48]), experiencing parental physical abuse (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = [1.16, 4.46]), and neighborhood cohesiveness (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = [0.31, 1.69]). IPV perpetration was only associated with experiencing parental physical abuse (OR = 2.86; 95% CI = [1.62, 5.07]). Reporting both IPV victimization and perpetration was associated with non-problem drinking (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = [1.15, 3.57]), problem drinking (OR = 2.65; 95% CI = [1.48, 4.74]), witnessing parental IPV (OR = 2.94; 95% CI = [1.80, 4.80]), experiencing parental physical abuse (OR = 2.23; 95% CI = [1.38, 3.60]), and homelessness (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = [1.14, 3.16]).

(De)criminalization of Survivors of Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: A Social Work Call to Action,"Gezinski, L.B.","Survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) are failing to be identified and are frequently criminalized. Examining the linkages between DMST and the juvenile legal system is important, as many trafficked youths are only identified after entry into the child welfare or juvenile court system as a result of being arrested or detained on related delinquency charges. Due to legacies of structural violence, marginalized youths are reluctant to approach police officers for help. Therefore, social workers have an opportunity to identify, intervene, and advocate for trafficked youths. In this article, the author provides an overview of existing research related to the demographic profile of DMST, homelessness and survival sex, recruitment and entry, barriers to effective community response, and prevention and intervention strategies. This article represents a call to broaden our view of young people in the sex trade and supports the decriminalization of trafficked youths.

Examining Sleep Disturbance Among Sheltered and Unsheltered Transition Age Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Redline, B.; Semborski, S.; Madden, D.R.; Rhoades, H.; Henwood, B.F.","Background: The estimated 3.5-million transition age youth (TAY) who experience homelessness in the United States annually are routinely exposed to inadequate sleep environments and other psychosocial risk factors for deficient sleep. Although staying in a shelter versus being unsheltered may facilitate sleep, research suggests that perceived safety wherever one sleeps may be just as important. In this study, which is the first known study to investigate sleep disturbances among TAY experiencing homelessness, we examine associations of sleep disturbances with sheltered status and perceived safety of usual sleep environment. Methods: We surveyed TAY (aged 18-25) experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles, CA about their sleep, psychosocial health, and living situations. Participants (n=103; 60% sheltered) self-reported sleep disturbances using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance short form, while individual items assessed sheltered status and perceived safety where they usually slept. Regression analyses examined associations of sheltered status and perceived sleep environment safety with sleep disturbance, adjusting for age, sex, race, self-rated health, depression symptoms, serious mental illness, high-risk drinking, and severe food insecurity. Results: Twenty-six percent of participants reported moderate-severe sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbance was not associated with sheltered status, but was positively associated with feeling unsafe in one's sleep environment, depression symptoms, severe food insecurity, and decreased age. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances among TAY experiencing homelessness are associated more closely with how safe one feels rather than one's sheltered status. This highlights the importance of providing safe places to live for sheltered and unsheltered TAY. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",2021,,Med.

Life-course predictors of homelessness from adolescence into adulthood: A population-based cohort study,"Heerde, J.A.; Bailey, J.A.; Kelly, A.B.; McMorris, B.J.; Patton, G.C.; Toumbourou, J.W.","Introduction: Internationally, the prevalence of young adult homelessness is concerning. Few data on life-course predictors from longitudinal studies exist, limiting our capacity to inform prevention strategies at the population-level. Methods: Data were drawn from a state representative population-based sample of young adults from Victoria, Australia participating in the International Youth Development Study (IYDS; N = 927, 54% female). Participants were recruited in state-representative secondary school samples at Grade 7 (age 13, 2002), with follow-up in Grades 9 (age 15) and 11 (age 17) and at ages 21, 23 and 25. Using longitudinal path modelling, we conducted a series of analyses testing life-course predictors of young adult homelessness across multiple socializing contexts, and the interrelationships among them. Results: The rate of young adult homelessness was 5.5%. Path modelling showed higher levels of family conflict at ages 13 and 15 uniquely predicted homelessness by age 25. This effect remained after accounting for other risk factors in peer-group (e.g., interactions with antisocial peers), school (e.g., low academic performance), and community contexts (e.g., low neighborhood attachment). Peer drug use and interaction with antisocial peers at age 15 mediated the association between family conflict at age 13 and homelessness by age 25. Conclusions: Findings point to the vulnerability of early adolescents to family conflict. This vulnerability heightens risk for young adult homelessness. Findings strengthen the case for both primary prevention programs that build healthy relationships between family members from early on in adolescence and for investment in homelessness prevention at key developmental periods. © 2021",2021,,J.

Conceptualising the social networks of vulnerable children and young people: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"Nevard, I.; Green, C.; Bell, V.; Gellatly, J.; Brooks, H.; Bee, P.","Purpose: The relationship between social networks and health and wellbeing is increasingly demonstrated in vulnerable adult populations. This relationship for vulnerable children and young people has not hitherto been systematically reviewed. This narrative synthesis aims to consolidate research to provide a foundational basis for future health-related social network research and interventions for children and young people. Methods: This mixed methods systematic review synthesises research investigating whole, egocentric social networks of 32 vulnerable child groups with a mean age below 18. There were no setting, language or date restrictions. The quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 6360 search results, 49 were included for narrative synthesis. Results: The majority of pertinent research originates from the USA; the most frequently investigated vulnerabilities were minority ethnic status, homelessness and the presence of special educational needs. Research aims and methodologies varied significantly between studies. Key findings included (i) vulnerable (excluding minority ethnic) children and young people have impoverished networks (ii) access to networks is a protective factor against negative outcomes (iii) social ties, primarily immediate family, provide access to personal resources and (iv) network ties are to a degree substitutable. Conclusions: Networks are associated with wellbeing and vulnerable children and young people commonly have impoverished networks, excluding cases where vulnerability classification relates to minority ethnic status. Network embeddedness is associated with positive outcomes, particularly for homeless children. Family are typically primary providers of support, but ties are substitutable when networks are restricted. Egocentric social network research is currently limited for vulnerable child populations. Further research could inform interventions that harness networks to improve health, wellbeing and functional outcomes for these child groups. © 2020, The Author(s).",2021,,Soc. Psychiatry Psychiatr.

Six service providers who worked with youth in care in various capacities were also interviewed. Data analysis revealed themes including: the experience of unstable housing and homelessness, lack of formal supports, and youth leaving care then wishing they could return. Another theme to emerge, I take responsibility for where I am now, adds new information to the literature. The research findings support that child welfare services should place greater emphasis on developing youths’ life skills while they are in care.

This paper presents results from a pilot evaluation of a text messaging-based smoking cessation treatment, as an adjunct to brief group cessation counseling, to improve abstinence rates among 18–25-year-old smokers experiencing homelessness.The goal of this study was to estimate effect sizes for a larger trial and it was not powered to detect group differences. Aims and Methods: YEH smokers who had a working cell phone with them at recruitment were randomized to receive a group counseling session, nicotine patches, and written material on quitting (n = 37) or a similar program that also included a 6-week automated text messaging intervention (TMI) to provide ongoing support for quitting (n = 40). Smoking outcomes were evaluated through a 90-day follow-up. Results: Seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 90-day follow-up was higher in theTMI condition than standard condition (17.50% vs. 8.11%, respectively; Cohen’s h = .37); however, the 90-day continuous abstinence rate was not statistically different from zero in either condition. Reductions in the number of days smoked in the past 30 days from baseline to follow-up were greater in the TMI condition than the standard condition (−14.24 vs. −8.62, respectively; Cohen’s d = .49). Conclusions: Adding a 6-week TMI support to a brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy protocol holds promise for smoking reduction and abstinence amongYEH smokers. Results indicate that further development and evaluation of theTMI in this population is warranted. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585. Registered March 14, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03874585. Implications: This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of using a text messaging-based intervention (TMI) for behavior change with 18–25 year olds experiencing homelessness, and more specifically, the first to test aTMI to provide ongoing support for smoking cessation. Small to medium effect sizes for theTMI are promising in terms of implementing aTMI using participants’ own cell phones, as well as the efficacy of this approach as an adjunct to standard care (brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy) for smoking cessation amongYEH. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Nicotine Tob.

Investigating the impacts of covid-19 among lgbtq2s youth experiencing homelessness,"Abramovich, A.; Pang, N.; Moss, A.; Logie, C.H.; Chaiton, M.; Kidd, S.A.; Hamilton, H.A.","Background LGBTQ2S youth are overrepresented among youth experiencing homelessness and experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to heterosexual and cisgender youth. COVID-19 related challenges for LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness remain unknown. To address this gap, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ2S youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada and surrounding areas. Methods Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness were recruited to participate in virtual surveys and in-depth one-on-one interviews. Surveys included standardized measures and were administered to measure mental health outcomes and collect information on demographic characteristics, and health service use. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests for difference of proportions. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative thematic content approach. Results Sixty-one youth completed surveys and 20 youth participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including experiencing poor mental health, such as suicidality, depression, anxiety, and increased substance use, and lack of access to health and social support services. Conclusion Our study highlights the need for LGBTQ2S inclusive and affirming health care and support services for precariously housed adolescents to address the pre-existing social and health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. © 2021 Abramovich et al.

Improving the sexual health of young people (Under 25) in high-risk populations: A systematic review of behavioural and psychosocial interventions,"Brown, E.; Monaco, S.L.; O’donoghue, B.; Nolan, H.; Hughes, E.; Graham, M.; Simmons, M.; Gray, R.","Background: Ensuring young people experience good sexual health is a key public health concern, yet some vulnerable groups of young people remain at higher risk of poor sexual health. These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Results: Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclu-sions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work. An international consensus on outcome measures would support the research field going forward, making future meta-analyses possible. © 2021 by the authors.

Cultivating safe and stable spaces: Reflections on a campus-based support program for foster care alumni and youth experiencing homelessness,"Cheatham, L.P.; Luo, Y.; Hubbard, S.; Jackson, M.S.; Hassenbein, W.; Bertram, J.","Foster care alumni and youth experiencing homelessness face similar challenges within higher education, including housing instability, food insecurity, as well as low levels of social, emotional and financial support — all of which contribute to poor rates of persistence and graduation. Given the intersecting challenges and needs of foster care alumni and youth experiencing homelessness, many college campuses have established formal support programs to meet the needs of these student populations. This study explores the implementation and administration of Alabama REACH, a campus-based support program for foster care alumni and youth experiencing homelessness who attend the University of Alabama. Through analysis of narratives elicited through three focus groups with program volunteers and staff, this study presents insights into program strengths and challenges, including the importance of social support, challenges of stigma and shame in program recruitment and service provision, and the need to prioritize stability and sustainability throughout program planning efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child.

Mental well-being and physical activity of young people experiencing homelessness before and during COVID-19 lockdown: A longitudinal study,"Thomas, J.; Bowes, N.; Meyers, R.; Thirlaway, K.","Background: While lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19 indisputably mitigated virus transmission, the aim of this longitudinal study was to establish indirect effects on vulnerable young people's mental well-being and physical activity (PA) levels. Methods: Surveys conducted at time 1 (February 2020), and time 2 (April 2020) comprised of the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and self-reported moderate and vigorous PA levels. Repeated measures analyses established changes pre-post lockdown restrictions, and differences between sub-groups. Associations between changes in well-being, self-esteem and PA over time were explored through further regression analyses. Results: 65 respondents completed the survey at time 1, and 50 respondent at time 2. Wellbeing increased significantly over time, yet remained significantly lower than the population average. Self-esteem increased significantly post-lockdown, however remained significantly lower for females, compared with males. Overall, PA levels increased-whereby ‘inactive’ participants at time 1 reported significant increases in moderate and total activity levels at time 2. Increased PA levels significantly predicted increased well-being: F(1, 48) = 4.15, p < .05; while participants who had become less active accounted for 69.2% with low self-esteem at time 2. Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased PA accounted for improved mental well-being, while decreased PA was associated with reduced levels of self-esteem. PA may represent a modifiable means of mitigating risk, and promoting resilience for vulnerable young people experiencing adverse conditions. © 2021",2021,,Ment. Health Phys.

Vaccination coverage among young homeless children compared to US national immunization survey data,"Fu, L.Y.; Torres, R.; Caleb, S.; Cheng, Y.I.; Gennaro, E.; Thoburn, E.; McLaughlin, J.; Alexander-Parrish, R.; Wang, J.","Introduction: Comprehensive vaccination coverage among homeless children in the United States (US) is largely unknown although a few studies suggest low coverage with single vaccinations. This study compared vaccination coverage with a combined 7-vaccines series among homeless children in the District of Columbia (DC) to coverage among other US children. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional survey of homeless children in DC was conducted from 2018 to 2019. Recruitment occurred at housing shelters, social services centers, and a diaper dispensary, and through limited chain referral. English-speaking parents of a child aged 19 to 35 months who spent the majority of the last 30 nights homeless were recruited. Participants consented for their child's healthcare providers to submit vaccination records. The vaccination coverage estimate of this sample was compared with estimates of three populations in the 2018 National Immunization Survey (NIS): children in DC (NIS DC), children in the US (NIS US), and children in the US below the federal poverty level (NIS poor). Results: Most of the 135 children had experienced at least two lifetime episodes (63.7%) and 12 months (57%) of homelessness. The estimated percent up to date was 52.6% (95% CI: 43.8%, 61.3%). This estimate was 20.4 (95% CI: 11.9, 28.8, p < .0001), 20 (95% CI: 11.5, 28.4, p < .0001), and 11.5 (95% CI: 3.1, 20, p < .01) percentage points lower than estimates for the NIS DC, NIS US and NIS poor populations, respectively. After adjusting for child's age and race/ethnicity, vaccination coverage of the NIS DC sample was below that of NIS US (p < .01) and NIS poor samples (p < .05). Conclusion: Children experiencing homelessness may be at risk of under-vaccination, even when compared to a general population of children in poverty. Awareness of this heightened risk may allow for more precise targeting of vaccination delivery support specifically to children experiencing homelessness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Vaccine,39,45,6637-6643,,10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.073,,#1446,Fu 2021,,
Research priorities to end the adolescent HIV epidemic in the United States: Viewpoint,"Isabel Fernandez, M.; Harper, G.W.; Hightow-Weidman, L.B.; Kapogiannis, B.G.; Mayer, K.H.; Parsons, J.T.; Rotheram-Borus, M.J.; Seña, A.C.; Sullivan, P.S.","Youth represent 21% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States. Gay, bisexual, and transgender (GBT) youth, particularly those from communities of color, and youth who are homeless, incarcerated, in institutional settings, or engaging in transactional sex are most greatly impacted. Compared with adults, youth have lower levels of HIV serostatus awareness, uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and adherence. Widespread availability of ART has revolutionized prevention and treatment for both youth at high risk for HIV acquisition and youth living with HIV, increasing the need to integrate behavioral interventions with biomedical strategies. The investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) completed a research prioritization process in 2019, focusing on research gaps to be addressed to effectively control HIV spread among American youth. The investigators prioritized research in the following areas: (1) innovative interventions for youth to increase screening, uptake, engagement, and retention in HIV prevention (eg, pre-exposure prophylaxis) and treatment services; (2) structural changes in health systems to facilitate routine delivery of HIV services; (3) biomedical strategies to increase ART impact, prevent HIV transmission, and cure HIV; (4) mobile technologies to reduce implementation costs and increase acceptability of HIV interventions; and (5) data-informed policies to reduce HIV-related disparities and increase support and services for GBT youth and youth living with HIV. ATN's research priorities provide a roadmap for addressing the HIV epidemic among youth. To reach this goal, researchers, policy makers, and health care providers must work together to develop, test, and disseminate novel biobehavioral interventions for youth. © M Isabel Fernandez, Gary W Harper, Lisa B Hightow-Weidman, Bill G Kapogiannis, Kenneth H Mayer, Jeffrey T Parsons, Mary Jane Rotheram-Borus, Arlene C Seña, Patrick S Sullivan",2021,,JMIR Res.

How peer support specialists uniquely initiate and build connection with young people experiencing homelessness,"Erangey, J.; Marvin, C.; Littman, D.M.; Mollica, M.; Bender, K.; Lucas, T.; Milligan, T.","Young people experiencing homelessness are often apprehensive to engage in conventional service systems due to prior mistreatment by providers and others in their lives, as well as stigma associated with accessing services. Even when relationships between service providers and young people are initiated, they often end prematurely. Mutual aid, or peer-to-peer support, has a long and promising history within the mental health field, yet has received little empirical attention in work with young people experiencing homelessness. The present study used participatory qualitative methods to understand how peers uniquely initiate and build connection with young people experiencing homelessness. Through interviews and journaling with peer support specialists and program staff, this study found that peers initiate relationships with young people by becoming familiar faces in youth spaces, identifying themselves as peers, then formalizing relationships with young people. Peers build connection by showing they are on the “same side of the glass” as young people, establishing autonomy and availability over a preset agenda, and creating containers acceptable for failure. Peers, their supervisors, and organizations building mutual aid programs may consider these findings when working to build programs which flexibly and authentically engage young people experiencing homelessness in meaningful relationships. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Development of a family-based mental health program for runaway adolescents using an intervention mapping protocol,"Noh, D.; Choi, S.","The mental health and related quality of life of runaway adolescents are global public health issues. As few intervention studies have considered the family contexts of runaway adolescents, we aimed to develop an intervention tailored specifically to the needs of this population using an Intervention Mapping protocol. First, a literature review and interviews with runaway adolescents and youth shelter workers were conducted to create a logic model of the problem. Second, the behavioral and environmental outcomes were set to adapt to stressful situations and enable families to become more resourceful in dealing with family adversity, based on the results of needs assessment. Performance objectives and changeable determinants were also created by reviewing the pertinent theories and studies. Third, theory- and evidence-based methods to influence changes in the determinants were identified. Fourth, we designed an eight-session family-based mental health program incorporating individual and family approaches for runaway adolescents. Fifth, we determined that mental health nurses at community mental health centers linked to youth shelters would serve as the program implementers. Finally, we planned a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of our program on improving runaway adolescents’ mental health status and perceived family functioning. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,,Int.

"Characteristics, experiences, and service utilization patterns of homeless youth in a transitional living program: Differences by LGBQ identity","Prock, K.A.; Kennedy, A.C.","Homeless youth who identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (LGBTQ) face considerable issues including victimization, mental health needs, and substance use, yet are less likely than their heterosexual homeless peers to utilize services. Although research in this area is growing, studies tend to focus on the experiences and service use of homeless youth in drop-in or emergency shelters, instead of longer-term transitional living programs (TLPs). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to expand the homeless youth literature by examining differences in sociodemographic characteristics, victimization, mental health, and substance use histories, and service utilization patterns of homeless youth by LGBQ identity (LGBQ vs. non-LGBQ) in a TLP. We extracted secondary data from closed case files of homeless youth (N = 101) ages 16–20 who accessed services in a mid-Michigan TLP between 2011 and 2018. Using independent sample t-tests and Chi-square, we assessed patterns by LGBQ. Results indicate that LGBQ homeless youth were more likely than their non-LGBQ homeless peers to identify as female, report being sexually victimized, and have greater mental health-related needs. All youth, but especially LGBQ youth underutilized available services, resulting in greater unmet mental health needs. These findings confirm the vulnerability of LGBQ homeless youth in TLPs and provide essential information regarding service utilization for homeless youth practitioners, including the need for trauma-informed and LGBTQ-specific services. Additionally, the data suggest that service providers must encourage youth engagement in services offered within TLPs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child. Youth Serv.

Looking for Wi-Fi: youth homelessness and mobile connectivity in the city,"Humphry, J.","Studies of digital disparities have focused on socio-spatial differences across neighbourhoods, regions and other kinds of places, but the same place can produce different experiences of connectivity, a phenomenon labelled ‘variable geometries of connection’ by Crang, Crosbie and Graham (2006: 2551) [2006. Crang, M., Crosbie, T., & Graham, S. Variable geometries of connection: Urban digital divides and the uses of information technology. Urban Studies, 43(13), 2551–2570]. In this paper, I draw on research on the role of mobile phones and the internet for people experiencing homelessess in Australia to suggest that dependence on smartphones for access to information and communication when homeless, in combination with the design and regulation of urban spaces, structures the mobilities of homeless young people, resulting in distinctive connectivity needs and barriers. Homeless young people overcome many of their immediate difficulties of digital access through practices of ‘survival infrastructuring’, a term I propose to describe the practices of marginalised actors to make their media work in the face of uneven, precarious and costly connectivity. Highlighting these connectivity experiences and practices may help efforts to take action on digital exclusion and assist homeless young people by taking into account differential access needs within specific spatial and social contexts.

It is unknown whether specific treatment approaches are more or less effective for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) compared to stably housed youth. The present study compared the effectiveness of the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Motivational Enhancement Therapy combined with Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), and Treatment as Usual (TAU) for these two groups. Further subgroup differences were investigated by age, sex, and sexual and gender minority status. Method: YEH (n = 855) and a matched sample of stably housed youth (n = 855) were drawn from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs, a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Multiple-group latent change score modeling was used to examine change in substance use frequency and related problems at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Results indicated significant declines in substance use frequency and problems during treatment for all intervention groups. The TAU group showed the greatest declines in substance use problems during treatment and the greatest declines in frequency post-treatment. Compared to stably housed youth, YEH entered treatment with greater substance use and problems, and had greater declines in substance use in the MET/CBT group only. Other differences were found by age and sex. Conclusions: Overall, all three substance use interventions appear to be effective in reducing substance use and related problems.

"Improving livelihoods and gender equitable attitudes of street-connected young people in Eldoret, Kenya: Results from a pilot evidence-based intervention","Embleton, L.; Di Ruggiero, E.; Logie, C.H.; Ayuku, D.; Braitstein, P.","Street-connected young people (SCY) in Eldoret, Kenya, experience substantial gender inequities, economic marginalization and are highly vulnerable to acquiring HIV. This study sought to explain and explore how participation in a pilot-adapted evidence-based intervention, Stepping Stones and Creating Futures, integrated with matched savings, changed SCY's economic resources, livelihoods and gender equitable attitudes. We piloted our adapted intervention using a convergent mixed-methods design measuring outcomes pre- and post-intervention with 80 SCY in four age- and gender-stratified groups of 20 participants per group (young women aged 16–19 years and 20–24 years, young men aged 16–19 years and 20–24 years). The pilot occurred at MTRH-Rafiki Centre for Excellence in Adolescent Health in Eldoret, Kenya, from September 2017 to January 2018. Through street outreach, Peer Facilitators created four age- and gender-stratified sampling lists of SCY whom met the eligibility criteria and whom indicated their interest in participating in the intervention during outreach sessions. Simple random sampling was used to select eligible participants who indicated their interest in participating in the intervention. The adapted intervention, Stepping Stones ya Mshefa na Kujijenga Kimaisha, included 24 sessions that occurred over 14 weeks, focused on sexual and reproductive health, gender norms in society, livelihoods and included a matched-savings programme conditional on attendance. The primary outcome of interest was gender equitable attitudes measured using the Gender Equitable Men scale and secondary outcomes included economic resources and livelihoods. Participants had a significant change in gender equitable attitudes from pre- to post-intervention from 43 (IQR 38–48) to 47 (IQR 42–51) (p <.001). Quantitatively and qualitatively participants reported increases in daily earnings, changes in street involvement, housing and livelihood activities.

Exploring the relationship between foster care experiences and social network engagement among a sample of homeless former foster youth,"Yoshioka-Maxwell, A.; Rice, E.","Introduction: Recent research has begun to demonstrate high rates of poor behavioral health outcomes among homeless former foster, but with relatively little attention in the scientific literature. Because social networks have been shown to impact behavioral health outcomes, we need to better understand the network characteristics of homeless young adults with a history of foster care. Methods: Data were collected from 184 homeless former foster youth at a drop-in center in Hollywood, California. A series of logistic regressions were conducted for network engagement behaviors that may be impacted by foster care experiences. Results: Youth were largely African American, Latino, and Mixed race, approximately 22 years old, and majority male. Significant results from the logistic regressions indicated that youth experiencing homelessness for the first time before exiting foster care were more likely to have alters engaging in condomless sex, and youth with higher numbers of foster care placements were more likely to have alters engaging in methamphetamine use. Conclusion: These results suggest that certain foster care experiences impact the types of alters with which youths engage. Time spent in placement was significantly associated with alter behaviors, evident from homeless experiences and multiple foster care placements, negatively impacting the types of alters with which youths are connected, and thusly the risk factors for the youth themselves. Frequent network disruptions may be associated with engagement with risky alters.

The levels of anger and aggression in street children with substance dependence,"Kaplan, V.; Çuhadar, D.","Problem: This is a descriptive study to determine the levels of anger and aggression in street children with substance dependence. Methods: The study was conducted between October 2013 and March 2014 with 103 street children who use substances. Personal Information Form, Aggression Scale (AS), and Trait Anger and Anger Expression Styles Scale (STAXI) were used as data collection tools. Findings: The rate of the children reported that they lived on the streets due to the conflicts with the family was 67% and 35% of participants reported that they were exposed to violence on the street. The total score of AS was 146.78 ± 25.91, the mean score of the anger subscale of the STAXI was 31.05 ± 9.00 while the scores of the anger-in subscale and the anger-out subscale scores were 19.02 ± 4.55 and 23.04 ± 6.19, respectively. The total scores of AS had a significant positive correlation with both the trait anger and “anger-in” subscale scores. The results show that substance use negatively affected anger control in street children. Conclusion: The data demonstrated that the presence of continuous anger and turning the anger against oneself correlated with increased levels of aggression. Increasing the duration of living on the street, working on the street and being exposed to stressful situations in the street increased the ""anger-in"" scores. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",2020,,J.

Prevalence of substance use and associated risk factors among homeless youth in Iran: A cross-sectional study,"Khezri, M.; Mirzazadeh, A.; McFarland, W.; Iranpour, A.; Shahesmaeili, A.; Zarei, J.; Mousavian, G.; Mehmandoost, S.; Sharifi, H.","Background: Homeless youth are at increased risk of substance use and its consequences worldwide. Substance use among youth who are homeless has not been as well studied, particularly in developing country settings. We therefore aimed to assess the prevalence and correlates of substance use among homeless youth in Kerman, a city in southeast Iran. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey by convenience sampling, we recruited 202 homeless youth from September to December 2017. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Youth were eligible if they were 15–29 years old and homeless or unstably housed for at least one month during last year. Factors associated with substance use were characterized by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: In our survey, 50.0% (95% CI 43.0–56.9) of homeless youth reported substance use in the last month. The most common substances used were heroin (34.0%), alcohol (31.2% – illegal in Iran), and methamphetamine (24.0%). Substance use was associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 6.57, 95% CI 2.72, 15.85), age 25–29 vs. 15–24 years (AOR 4.02, 95% CI 1.57, 10.29), current tobacco use (AOR 6.49, 95% CI 2.63, 16.00), and absolute homelessness vs. relative homelessness (AOR 7.75, 95% CI 2.90, 20.68). Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for prevention programs to reduce substance use-related harm among homeless youth, particularly among tobacco users and those completely homeless. Innovative strategies are needed reach the absolutely homeless and simultaneously address the substance use and competing social welfare needs of this vulnerable population. © 2020",2020,,Child.

"“Having a Baby Can Wait”: Experiences of a Sexual and Reproductive Health Promotion Program in the Context of Homelessness among Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander Youth Captured Through PhotoVoice","Aparicio, E.M.; Kachingwe, O.N.; Phillips, D.R.; Jasczynski, M.; Cabral, M.K.; Aden, F.; Parekh, E.; Espero, J.; Childers, C.","Nearly half of female youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) become pregnant due to myriad individual, family, community, and structural factors. In response, our team developed and tested Wahine (“woman”) Talk, a multilevel, trauma-informed sexual and reproductive health intervention created with and for female YEH aged 14 to 22. After Wahine Talk, youth were invited to participate in a participatory action PhotoVoice project regarding experiences of the program, waiting to start or expand their families, and homelessness. Photographs were taken and captioned by youth, and then further examined through Thematic Analysis. Final project themes include (a) Youth-Driven Birth Timing Decisions; (b) A Sense of Place: Finding Safe Spaces; and (c) Glimpsing Hope.

Interventions for youth homelessness: A systematic review of effectiveness studies,"Morton, M.H.; Kugley, S.; Epstein, R.; Farrell, A.","Objective: This systematic review synthesizes effectiveness evidence on interventions to prevent and address youth homelessness. It was conducted primarily for a United States policy and practice audience but involved an international synthesis of evidence. Method: We conducted an international search that included eleven major academic electronic databases, 13 additional relevant institutional web-based publication databases, and a professional outreach for published and unpublished studies of the effectiveness of programs and practices to prevent or address youth homelessness, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. We searched databases for studies published or completed between January 1, 2008 and March 19, 2019, and we also reviewed earlier studies synthesized in a similar past systematic review that ended its search in 2008. The review included experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies of youth ages 13–25. We included studies that only used pre-post comparisons and denote lower rigor designs clearly in the synthesis. Results: The search identified 4,387 potentially relevant unique publications. After screening, 66 publications representing 53 unique studies of 54 different interventions remained and were included in this review. The vast majority (83%) of unique studies were conducted in the U.S. Of the 53 unique studies, 22 (42%) involved some type of randomized evaluation. Many studies involved low rigor designs with weak counterfactuals, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. Included studies evaluated a range of interventions, and we grouped these into seven broad categories. The largest evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions relates to counseling and treatment interventions to address mental health or health risk behaviors. Overall, these studies showed promising results, but few included long-term follow-up. A small number of studies demonstrated reductions in occurrence of youth homelessness and housing instability, including some intensive case management and support interventions without direct housing assistance components. The field lacks rigorous evaluative evidence of many of the program models on which communities and governments rely to address youth homelessness (for example, street outreach, transitional living programs, youth shelters, host homes, and rapid rehousing). Evaluative evidence is further lacking on how the effects of interventions vary by subpopulations disproportionately impacted by homelessness. Discussion and conclusion: Policy and community interventions to prevent and end youth homelessness require a robust evidence base to inform decision-making. This systematic review presents an important starting point to inform solutions across a range of intervention areas, and it reveals significant areas in which investments in research and evaluation are urgently needed. © 2020 The Authors",2020,,Child.

Youth who sleep in motels: an acknowledged but unknown population of the hidden homeless,"Tsukerman, K.; Ruel, E.; Wright, E.R.; Lewinson, T.","There is not one unifying definition of youth homelessness in the U.S. Rather, youth who are homeless are included in three separate definitions. Youth who sleep in motels are included in these definitions depending on whether they are in school, their age, and how long they are able to stay. Motel residents are not counted in the annual Point in Time counts in most cities and are excluded from literature on youth who are homeless, leaving a dearth of information on their experiences. In addition, little is known about the needs of motel youth and how they might differ from youth staying in other temporary accommodations, especially those recognized by HUD. This paper takes a first step to assess if youth who experience homelessness in motels vary in any major ways from youth who reported a different sleeping location on the previous night in a 2015 survey of Atlanta homeless youth. Findings show statistically significant relationships between one’s sleeping location and income, substance use, contact with homeless service providers, and age. The results imply that there might be important differences between youth who reside in motels and those who reside in other locations while homeless. © 2021 Housing Education and Research Association.",2021,,Hous.

Childhood sexual abuse moderates the mediating pathways connecting cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation among homeless youth,"Zhang, J.; Wu, Q.; Slesnick, N.","Cognitive distortions are conceptualized as one of the most potent predictors of suicide. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation. The present study examined a prospective moderated mediation model linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation, with drug use, social problem-solving, and perceived burdensomeness as the mediators and childhood sexual abuse as the moderator. Participants included 150 homeless youth who participated in a randomized clinical trial for suicide intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. We analyzed the data using a multiple-group path model. Findings showed that social problem-solving and perceived burdensomeness sequentially mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation regardless of childhood sexual abuse, whereas drug use mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation only among youth reporting no history of sexual abuse. Findings highlight how coping processes, both adaptive and maladaptive, operate differently to predict suicidal ideation contingent on the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of cognitive distortions. Findings also underscore the importance of addressing the effects of childhood abuse to facilitate the efficiency of interventions that seek to reduce suicidal ideation among a vulnerable population.

Designing theoretically and evidence-based social procurement programmes in construction: A capability empowerment approach,"Bridgeman, J.; Loosemore, M.","Social procurement policies require companies to develop and implement initiatives to create social value, yet many programmes created in response to these emerging policies lack a reliable empirical and theoretical foundation. Addressing this problem and brining a new theoretically informed evidence-based approach to social procurement research in construction, this paper presents a theoretically informed and methodologically robust social return on investment (SROI) analysis of a construction training programme developed to reduce the risk of youth homelessness. Mobilising Sen and Nussbaum's Capability Empowerment Approach, the paper provides robust, testable and transparent evidence of the social impact of the programme on the lives of the homeless people who went through it.

"QueerVIEW: Protocol for a technology-mediated qualitative photo elicitation study with sexual and gender minority youth in Ontario, Canada","Craig, S.L.; Eaton, A.D.; Pascoe, R.; Egag, E.; McInroy, L.B.; Fang, L.; Austin, A.; Dentato, M.P.","Background: The experiences of resilience and intersectionality in the lives of contemporary sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) are important to explore. SGMY face unique experiences of discrimination in both online and offline environments, yet simultaneously build community and seek support in innovative ways. SGMY who identify as transgender, trans, or gender nonconforming and have experiences with child welfare, homelessness, or immigration have been particularly understudied. A qualitative exploration that leverages technology may derive new understanding of the negotiations of risk, resilience, and identity intersections that impact the well-being of vulnerable SGMY. Objective: The objectives of the QueerVIEW study were to (1) enhance understanding of SGMY identities, both online and offline, (2) identify experiences of intersectionality among culturally, regionally, and racially diverse SGMY in Ontario, Canada, (3) explore online and offline sources of resilience for SGMY, and (4) develop and apply a virtual photo elicitation methodological approach. Methods: This is the first study to pilot a completely virtual approach to a photo elicitation investigation with youth, including data collection, recruitment, interviewing, and analysis. Recruited through social media, SGMY completed a brief screening survey, submitted 10 to 15 digital photos, and then participated in an individual semistructured interview that focused on their photos and related life experiences. Online data collection methods were employed through encrypted online file transfer and secure online interviews. Data is being analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory approach, with six coders participating in structured online meetings that triangulated photo, video, and textual data. Results: Data collection with 30 participants has been completed and analyses are underway. SGMY expressed appreciation for the photo elicitation and online design of the study and many reported experiencing an emotional catharsis from participating in this process. It is anticipated that results will form a model of how participants work toward integrating their online and offline experiences and identities into developing a sense of themselves as resilient. Conclusions: This protocol presents an innovative, technology-enabled qualitative study that completely digitized a popular arts-based methodology-photo elicitation-that has potential utility for contemporary research with marginalized populations. The research design and triangulated analyses can generate more nuanced conceptualizations of SGMY identities and resilience than more traditional approaches. Considerations for conducting online research may be useful for other qualitative research. © 2020 JMIR Publications. All rights reserved.",2020,,JMIR Res.

Logistical needs of youth included housing, employment, education, transportation, legal aid, obtaining documents, and food security. Mental health needs include substance misuse treatment and recovery services, treatment for co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders, trauma-informed approaches to care, services for LGBTQ + youth, and coping/life skills. Medical needs included those around sexual health and family planning, dental and vision care, primary care, immunizations, and chronic disease management.

Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Initiation and Completion among Youth Experiencing Homelessness in Seven U.S. Cities,"Gallardo, K.R.; Santa Maria, D.; Narendorf, S.; Markham, C.M.; Swartz, M.D.; Hsu, H.-T.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Bender, K.; Shelton, J.; Ferguson, K.","Little is known about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), who may be at higher risk for HPV than their housed counterparts. We examined the prevalence and associations of HPV vaccination initiation and completion among YEH. Guided by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, we analyzed cross-sectional data collected from YEH (N = 1074; ages 18–26) in seven U.S. cities to assess HPV vaccination prevalence and to identify predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with HPV vaccination status. Due to timing differences in the release of HPV vaccine recommendations, we conducted separate logistic regression analyses for men (n = 673) and women (n = 401). Approximately 19% of men and 37% of women had initiated and completed HPV vaccination. Several factors among men (i.e., older age, Latinx ethnicity, San Jose or St. Louis residence compared with New York City, never having had sex, and not previously being tested for STIs) and women (i.e., lower education level, San Jose or Houston residence compared with New York City, and never having had sex) were associated with lower odds of HPV vaccination initiation, completion, or both. Gay men had higher odds of initiating and completing the vaccination series than their heterosexual counterparts. Our findings reveal that HPV vaccination uptake is low among YEH and that there are vaccination disparities among subgroups of YEH. HPV vaccination strategies and resources that are easy-to-understand, facilitate point-of-care services, and address societal and system-level vaccination barriers encountered by YEH are needed. © 2020, Society for Prevention Research.",2020,,Prev.

This review summarizes what has been reported in the past 3 years (2017–2020) regarding emotional, psychological, and behavioral effects of exposure to this particular earthquake on children 10 years and older. Recent Findings: Twenty-six articles were screened, of which twenty-one were selected for final analysis. The main themes addressed in the literature over the 3 years concerned prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, determinants of resilience factors, prevalence of sexual violence as well as prenatal exposure, and subsequent autism behaviors/symptoms. Summary: The majority of the findings analyzed in this review on mental health in young Haitian survivors of the 2010 earthquake came from cross-sectional studies conducted in West region of Haiti, spefically Port-au-Prince. There was a paucity of longitudinal and translational data available.

Youth experiencing homelessness reported high acceptance of the app. Several youths described changing risk behaviors after enrolling in the study. Youth found the app easy to navigate and the goal interface helpful in tracking progress. Challenges included stolen phones and survey timing. Youth experiencing homelessness strongly recommended customized messages and questions to avoid redundancy, and that real-time support for struggling youth be accessible through the app. Conclusion.

"Pathways through homelessness: the perceptions of homeless children in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","Wilshire Jones Bornman, A.; Mitchell, C.J.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore children’s pathways through homelessness within the South African context, with particular attention paid to pathways out of homelessness. This study focusses on factors influencing children’s successful transitions out of homelessness. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative exploratory design was used, using interviews with nine children who had exited or were in the process of exiting homelessness. Interviews were conducted at a children’s shelter in Pietermaritzburg or in the children’s home environments. Interviews were analysed thematically. Findings: An ecological framework was used to frame the factors influencing children’s pathways in, through and out of homelessness in the children’s narratives. These included institutions, relationships and intrapersonal strengths and resources. The study suggested that constructive relationships with shelter staff and parental figures, as well as intrapersonal strengths, were the most prominent factors in children successfully negotiating their way through their homelessness. The importance of a relationship with the paternal family within some African cultures was also a point of leverage. Research limitations/implications: Implications for policy and practise include the need for systemic change, as well as greater support for shelters and shelter staff. The issue of rivalry in the shelter context and the role of the paternal family in the reintegration process require more research attention. The research is limited to homeless children in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Practical implications: This study provided feedback to the shelter regarding their strategies for assisting homeless children off the streets. It further provided evidence for the importance of the work of the shelter, to strengthen advocacy efforts. This may be useful to others in similar circumstances. Social implications: This study highlights the importance of macrosystemic interventions in the efforts to assist homeless children, while at the same time not ignoring the inter and intra, personal elements to enhancing their well-being. Originality/value: This paper is singular in its exploration of factors influencing children’s successful transitions out of homelessness within the South African context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,,J.

Perceptions of young adults’ problematic technology use among australian youth professionals,"Keen, B.; Gainsbury, S.M.","The effects of excessive and problematic technology use on young people’s mental health has not been explored from the perspective of those who work closely with youth in a professional capacity. This study reports on findings from focus group interviews with 22 professionals in the fields of education, counselling and mental health, community and housing, social work, and drug and alcohol services. Most problems participants observed related to video gaming (predominantly amongst men) and social media use (predominantly amongst women). Participants perceived most harms to be related to social or psychological difficulties such as relationship breakdowns, isolation, low self-confidence, depressive symptoms, and unrealistic expectations of success. More tangible harms relating to homelessness, physical fighting resulting from online exclusion, and sleep disturbances leading to absence from school and work commitments were also reported, albeit less frequently. The relationship between technology use and poor psychosocial outcomes was conceptualised as being complex and often cyclic in nature, whereby disadvantage and family dynamics were often predictive of problems. Most services did not formally screen for technology-related problems, however many were interested in upskilling by way of training, awareness, and implementation of screening measures and formal referral procedures. This research suggests that young people are presenting with technology-related problems but that more needs to be done to provide youth services and organisations with adequate support to identify and assist with these issues. © 2007-2021 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.",2021,,Cyberpsychology,15,1,1,,10.5817/CP2021-1-8,,#1522,Keen 2021,,

Methods: We used the concatenated Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Treatment Episode Data Set Admissions (total youth admissions, n = 5,153,775; and youth reported being homeless at the time of admission, n = 241,310). Prevalence estimates and binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios to identify the differences among youth who reported being homeless or housed at the time of the treatment. Results: Homeless youth had higher odds than housed youth to self-refer for treatment; to enroll in treatment for cocaine/crack, heroin, or methamphetamine; and to receive treatment in 24-hour detoxication facilities or long-term residential facilities. Additional differences were identified among youth aged 12–17 years and youth aged 18–24 years and by sex within the homeless youth population. Conclusions: This analysis provides a picture of treatment utilization patterns by youth who are experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder, by exploring differences by housing status among admissions to publicly funded treatment facilities. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2020,,J.

Adolescent suicide as a global public health issue,"Abraham, Z.K.; Sher, L.","Youth suicide is a major global mental health problem. This review looks at the epidemiology, risk and protective factors associated with youth suicide, and global strategies to address this important issue. To better understand factors contributing to youth suicide, global gender differences in suicide were examined. Global rates of suicide amongst young men are higher than young women. However, there are anomalously higher rates of female youth suicide in India and China, and possible causes of this are examined further. It is likely that underestimation of youth suicide is a major factor affecting the accuracy of suicide epidemiology. Risk factors for youth suicide are varied. Psychiatric factors include various psychiatric illnesses, substance use (particularly amongst refugee and homeless youth). Psychosocial risk factors include family conflict, physical and sexual childhood abuse, isolation, socioeconomic disadvantage, discrimination and acculturation. Vulnerable populations are at increased risk, including refugee/immigrant/indigenous youth, those in foster care and homeless youth. Protective factors can include family cohesion and strong interpersonal relationships, as well as increased access to care. Global strategies to prevent youth suicide include reducing lethal means to suicide and reducing harmful media reporting. Various psychosocial interventions may be helpful, including individual support, and family, school and community based interventions.

Transgender and Gender-Expansive Homeless Youth: Considerations for Empowerment Using a Narrative Approach,"Peters, S.W.","Transgender and gender-expansive homeless youth face challenges. These often begin at home where they receive messages that something is wrong with them, frequently continuing at school and for some, the child welfare system. This population may become marginalized and feel the need to leave home. Becoming homeless can reinforce those messages leading to more negative life stories, possibly resulting in devaluation and further vulnerability. Aspects of narrative therapy may challenge those stories allowing space for preferred, empowering narratives that may help bring about change in themselves and their future. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2021,,J.

Practices effective for assisting young people avoid or exit homelessness: Young service recipient's perspectives,"Keevers, L.; Rambaldini-Gooding, D.","In youth homelessness policy, outcomes-based performance management and evidence-based practice predominate. Despite policymakers articulating a need to improve the evidence base to inform service provision for young people vulnerable to homelessness, there are limited evidence-based studies investigating the effectiveness of different service models. Additionally, the voices of homeless young people are often absent or unheard in policy discussions and program development. Underpinned by a practice-based approach and gathering both quantitative and qualitative data, this study investigates the perspectives and experiences of young people involved with an Australian social justice organisation and identifies the practices that they perceive as having the most significant positive impacts on their lives. The views of young people challenge government policy settings which this study suggests do not give sufficient weight to key indicators such as a sense of belonging, control over one's life and hope for the future or to relationships embedded in long-term, holistic, integrated care. In order to improve policy and practice, it's critical that the voices and knowledge of young people with lived experience are heard by decision and policymakers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Promoting Personal Growth in Young People Experiencing Homelessness through an Outdoors-Based Program,"Parry, B.J.; Thompson, J.L.; Holland, M.J.G.; Cumming, J.","Outdoors-based youth development programs demonstrate the efficacy to improve indicators of personal growth and mental health in a range of disadvantaged young people. However, the most marginalized young people in society, who stand to benefit the most from such initiatives, remain underrepresented in the research. My Strengths Training for Life (MST4Life) is a positive youth development (PYD) intervention for young people experiencing homelessness that incorporates a life skills program and an outdoor adventure education (OAE) course. The current study presents a qualitative investigation of the OAE course to understand its role in promoting positive changes for participants. Reflexive thematic analysis led to the development of inductively driven themes which were conceptualized based on relevant theories (e.g., relational developmental systems) and models (e.g., 5 Cs of PYD). Findings highlight the benefits of a preceding life skills program to psychologically prepare participants to thrive in the unfamiliar setting of the outdoors and related challenges. During the course, adaptive developmental regulations supported participants' basic psychological needs and fostered personal growth. Improvements in social competence was a common theme across participants and played a pivotal role in facilitating balanced development across the 5 Cs. In addition, experiences during the course promoted indicators of mental health and intentions to make positive lifestyle changes. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to making outdoors-based youth development courses more accessible for marginalized young people, as well as how OAE and PYD programs can add value to the youth homeless sector. © 2021 University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

Mindfulness-based intervention to decrease mood lability in at-risk youth: Preliminary evidence for changes in resting state functional connectivity,"Hafeman, D.M.; Ostroff, A.N.; Feldman, J.; Hickey, M.B.; Phillips, M.L.; Creswell, D.; Birmaher, B.; Goldstein, T.R.","Background: In youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder (BD), mood lability is an important precursor to BD onset. Previous work in adults indicates that mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) may improve emotion regulation, in part by increasing resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and executive control network (ECN). In this pilot study, we assessed effects of an MBI on PCC-ECN rsFC and mood lability in at-risk youth. Methods: We recruited 35 youth (10–14 years old) with a first-degree family history of BD and mood lability, and 21 age-matched healthy controls. Eligible at-risk youth were scanned pre/post an 8-week MBI and assessed three months later. Healthy controls were scanned at matched timepoints but did not participate in the MBI. The MBI used age-appropriate strategies to promote non-judgmental, present-moment awareness. We assessed pre/post changes in PCC-ECN rsFC and how rsFC changes were related to mood outcomes. Results: Twenty at-risk youth were scanned pre/post MBI; 16 had high-quality rsFC data. Following MBI, at-risk youth showed increased rsFC between PCC and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (BA 9; k = 28; corrected p=.006); healthy controls did not show this increase. Following MBI, at-risk youth reported more mindfulness (F = 7.15, p=.003), less mood lability (F = 7.2, p=.002), and less suppression of negative emotions (F = 5.05, p=.01). PCC-DLPFC rsFC increases predicted less mood lability (t=−2.25, p=.04) and less emotion suppression (t=−2.75, p=.02) at follow-up. Limitations: Small sample and lack of a control intervention. Conclusions: PCC-DLPFC rsFC may be a clinically meaningful neural target of an MBI in at-risk youth, related to improvements in mood lability. © 2020",2020,,J.

Self-harm among in-school and street-connected adolescents in Ghana: A cross-sectional survey in the Greater Accra region,"Quarshie, E.N.-B.; Shuweihdi, F.; Waterman, M.; House, A.","Objectives To identify the prevalence, methods, associations and reported reasons for self-harm among in-school and street-connected adolescents in Ghana. Design A cross-sectional survey. We applied multi-level regression models and model-based cluster analysis to the data. Setting Three contexts in the Greater Accra region were used: second cycle schools, facilities of charity organisations and street census enumeration areas (sleeping places of street-connected adolescents, street corners, quiet spots of restaurants, markets, train and bus stations, and lorry and car parks). Participants A regionally representative sample of 2107 (1723 in-school and 384 street-connected) adolescents aged 13-21 years. Outcome measures Participants responded to a structured self-report anonymous questionnaire describing their experience of self-harm and eliciting demographic information and social and personal adversities. Results The lifetime prevalence of self-harm was 20.2% (95% CI 19.0% to 22.0%), 12-month prevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 15.0% to 18.0%) and 1-month prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 2.0% to 4.0%). Self-injury alone accounted for 54.5% episodes and self-poisoning alone for 16.2% episodes, with more than one method used in 26% of episodes. Self-cutting (38.7%) was the most common form of self-injury, whereas alcohol (39.2%) and medications (27.7%) were the most commonly reported means of self-poisoning. The factors associated with self-harm were interpersonal: conflict with parents (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.87, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.81), physical abuse victimisation (aOR=1.69, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.47), difficulty in making and keeping friends (aOR=1.24, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.80), sexual abuse victimisation (aOR=1.21, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.87) and conflict between parents (aOR=1.07, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.56). Conclusions Self-harm is a significant public health problem among in-school and street-connected adolescents in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Its origins are very largely in social and familial adversity, and therefore prevention and treatment measures need to be focused in these areas.  ©",2021,,BMJ Open,11,1,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041609,,#1541,Quarshie 2021,,
Virtual reality meditation among youth experiencing homelessness: Pilot randomized controlled trial of feasibility,"Chavez, L.J.; Kelleher, K.; Slesnick, N.; Holowacz, E.; Luthy, E.; Moore, L.; Ford, J.","Background: Homelessness among youth is devastating, with high rates of substance use disorders and mental health comorbidity. Mindfulness-based interventions that include meditation and mindfulness skills training reduce stress and symptoms of anxiety or depression. However, engaging high-risk youth in interventions is challenging. Virtual reality is a more flexible platform for delivering meditation and may be appealing to youth. Objective: The study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of delivering virtual reality meditation and of collecting outcome measures, including anxiety and physiologic stress. Methods: A sample of 30 youth experiencing homelessness was enrolled in the study. Youth were randomized to receive 10 minutes of one of three interventions: (1) virtual reality meditation, (2) audio meditation (through a web-based platform), or (3) virtual reality imagery of historical pictures and text. Subjects who consented to the study attended two research visits. The first visit collected survey measures of demographics, mental health, and substance use, and oriented subjects to the intervention platforms. The second visit (1-3 days later) delivered the intervention and collected pre and post outcome measures of anxiety and physiologic stress (salivary cortisol). Changes in anxiety and cortisol at the second visit were compared across groups using a linear regression model in which the primary analysis compared virtual reality meditation to audio meditation and secondary analyses compared virtual reality meditation to virtual reality imagery. Results: Anxiety scores decreased in all groups, with a larger reduction among the virtual reality meditation group (difference=10.8) compared to the web-based meditation or virtual reality images groups (difference=5.8 and 5.0, respectively). After controlling for baseline values, there were no significant group differences in changes in anxiety scores or cortisol levels. In comparing virtual reality meditation and audio meditation, the effect size for anxiety was moderate (Cohen d=0.58) while the effect size for cortisol was small (Cohen d=0.08). Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that virtual reality meditation has a moderate benefit for anxiety but not physiologic stress. Future research is needed to confirm these results in a larger sample and to investigate whether the effects are sustained or increase with repeated use of virtual reality mediation. Virtual reality meditation appears feasible to deliver among homeless youth and merits further study. © Laura Johnson Chavez, Kelly Kelleher, Natasha Slesnick, Eugene Holowacz, Ellison Luthy, Laura Moore, Jodi Ford.

Adaption and implementation of the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) North for Indigenous youth.,"Toombs, E.; Mushquash, C.J.; Lund, J.; Pitura, V.A.; Toneguzzi, K.; Leon, S.; Bobinski, T.; Vitopoulos, N.; Frederick, T.; Kidd, S.","There is a high prevalence of Indigenous youth experiencing either precarious housing or homelessness in northwestern Ontario. Given that Indigenous pathways to homelessness can differ from non-Indigenous youth, interventions that address homelessness must also adapt to meet diverse needs. The Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) is a tertiary prevention intervention designed to provide congruent housing and peer and mental health supports for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Ontario. Less is known regarding its adaptability to adequately serve Indigenous youth in northwestern Ontario. This study assessed the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of an adaptation of the HOP-C North program for transitional aged Indigenous youth exiting homelessness in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Participants completed premeasures (n = 15) and postmeasures (n = 8) as well as qualitative interviews regarding their experiences in the program. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with staff (n = 14) engaged in implementing the program. After completing the HOP-C North program, participants reported improvements in a number of outcomes, including increased educational enrollment, attainment of employment, reduced hospitalizations, and increased engagement in clinical mental health services. Specific program aspects that participants found helpful included increased program flexibility, accessibility, emphasis on relationships, relevance of programming, fostering participant autonomy, and an adaptive approach to program implementation. These findings suggest that the HOP-C North model, when adapted, is a helpful program for Indigenous youth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Policy Relevance Statement: Maintaining housing stability for previously homeless Indigenous youth can be challenging as this population tends to have complex needs related to health, finances, and overall well-being. To help reduce these barriers related to this transition to housing and promote health, the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative North (HOP-C North) provided youth with culturally relevant supports, including individual and group counseling services, peer mentorship, case management, and cultural mentorship. HOP-C North was a cost-effective way to promote integrated health care for a population that may not otherwise access these supports.

"Rhythms of the unemployed: Making art and making do through spoken word in Kisumu, Kenya","Unseld, F.","Young people from the low-income settlements in Kenya's third-largest city, Kisumu, struggling with unemployment refer to their efforts to generate a livelihood as 'hustling'. At the same time, many of them put art (dance, music, poetry) at the centre of their lives. This article attempts to account for the significant popularity of the arts among Kisumu's youth. It understands the 'way of the artist' as an alternative interpretation of work and a framework in which people situate their experiences of unemployment, waiting and insecure work. To examine this framework in action, the article follows Janabii, a poet who has been at the centre of attempts to establish a spoken word scene in Kisumu. Janabii has spent several years in limbo, oscillating between glittering performances and a more discreet daily life, marked by functional homelessness and a refusal to surrender to the violence of Kenya's informal world of work. The article contributes to recent studies about hustling by combining an ethnography of a week in Janabii's life with a literary analysis of excerpts from one of his poems, in order to elucidate how his struggles to get by are narrated and stylized through a spoken word, artistic imaginary that interrelates with his everyday life.

Learning to endure: A qualitative examination of the protective factors of homeless transgender and gender expansive youth engaged in survival sex,"Greenfield, B.; Alessi, E.J.; Manning, D.; Dato, C.; Dank, M.","Background: Transgender and gender expansive (TGE) youth face a number of adversities that are associated with deleterious consequences, including mental health problems, substance misuse, suicide, and homelessness. However, there is evidence that TGE youth still demonstrate resilience under extraordinary conditions. Aims: Therefore, this study examined how TGE youth who are homeless and engaging in survival sex describe and understand the protective factors present in their lives. Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 57 TGE youth living in a large U.S. city. Participants were 17-26 years old (M = 19.88, SD = 1.55), and identified as transgender woman (53%), transgender man (16%), and other (32%; gender-queer, gender-fluid, androgynous, or non-binary). Youth identified as Black (40%), multiracial (35%), Latinx (16%), White (5%), and as another race (3%). Researchers conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data using thematic analysis. Results: We identified three themes to capture youth’s understanding of their protective factors: relying on oneself and others to avoid violence, accessing gender-affirming health and mental health care, and proactively maintaining sexual health. Participants described strategies for mitigating risk of harm while attempting to meet their basic needs. Additionally, they discussed the importance of having gender-affirming health and mental health services. Participants also expressed keen awareness of their sexual health risks and making calculated, often proactive decisions about their sexual health. Conclusion: The protective factors described by TGE youth reflect the unique ways in which hyper-marginalized youth must navigate their own survival and well-being, and align with literature suggesting resilience is not mutually exclusive from risk. By focusing on TGE youth, this research privileges the experiences of individuals historically underrepresented in research and encourages future research to incorporate these perspectives into policies and programs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2021,,Int.

Family relationships and the health and well-being of transgender and gender-diverse youth: A critical review,"Brown, C.; Porta, C.M.; Eisenberg, M.E.; McMorris, B.J.; Sieving, R.E.","Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth experience significant health and well-being disparities compared to their cisgender peers. However, disparities experienced at a population level might be mitigated by individual-level factors such as strong family relationships. Discrete aspects of strong family relationships may impact the health and well-being of TGD youth differently. To date, no systematic review known to us has explored the state of the science regarding the association between family relationships and the health and well-being of TGD adolescents and young adults. As such, our review aimed to (1) compile and present the scientific literature addressing the connection between family relationships and the health and well-being of TGD youth in those families; (2) sort results utilizing the Family Strengths Model; and (3) assess the strength of the literature with evidence-based appraisal tools. Sixteen articles met eligibility criteria (10 quantitative and 6 qualitative). These articles discussed family relationship qualities influencing health and well-being outcomes, including mental health, homelessness, sexual health, and substance use. Three of six qualities of strong families - coping ability, appreciation and affection, and positive communication - were represented in the literature. The risk for bias and study strength appraisals suggest that the available literature is moderately strong overall. Certain characteristics of strong families (commitment, enjoyable time spent together, and spiritual well-being) were underrepresented in the literature. Future research should explore these gaps to ensure that health care and community service providers can deliver the most effective support and care for TGD youth and their families.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",2020,,LGBT Health,7,8,407-419,,10.1089/lgbt.2019.0200,,#1553,Brown 2020,,
"Social media as moral laboratory: street involved youth, death and grief","Selfridge, M.; Mitchell, L.M.","Street involved youth experience both increased rates of mortality and the all too frequent deaths of people they know, rely on, and care about. In this paper, we explore how street-involved youth dealing with the death of peers or family are engaging in what Mattingly calls ‘moral laboratories’, that is, ‘experiments in how life might or should be lived’ (2014, 27). Drawing from interviews with youth in Victoria, Canada, we analyse aspects of their narratives on social media and grief–finding out about the death, what to post, and supporting others. The affordances of social media mean news of a death can spread like wildfire, private lives become public, the deceased’s reputation is scrutinized and judged, as are the words and actions of youth trying to survive. In offline and online spaces, marginalized youth experiment with expressing their grief, rage, and hope, with mourning and memorializing, navigating fractured and complicated relationships, and finding ways to support themselves and others. We argue that thinking about the ‘moral lives’ of street youth can highlight important aspects of their relationships of family, friendships, and community and their strategies for both protecting these key relationships and finding reasons to keep on living. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,,J.

Respondents indicated that abortions are common in this population. Many youth also reported they either had, and/or knew of others, who had attempted abortions outside of the formal medical system while experiencing homelessness. Most youth noted that self-inductions resulted from not knowing where or how to access abortions safely, and as many feared stigma, judgment, and violence from family members and serious partners in response to obtaining abortions. Most youth reflected inaccurate perceptions regarding abortion cost, accessibility, and legality.

Beyond a Bed: Supportive Connections Forged Between Youth Who Are Couch Hopping and Adult Hosts,"Curry, S.R.; VanMeeter, M.; Tully, B.A.; Ault, S.; Garst, N.; Adam, K.; Nesmith, A.; White, J.","“Couch hopping” is generally considered a form of housing instability. Prior research has highlighted the discomfort and, sometimes, dangers associated with couch hopping in late adolescence or young adulthood. However, we postulated that in some cases youth may develop positive longer-term housing arrangements with adults drawn from their existing network. Through in-depth interviews with a diverse group of nine youth (17–23 years) dealing with housing instability and ten adult hosts in rural, suburban and urban areas of a Midwestern state, we sought to explore how youth found adults to stay with, what kind of support they received, as well as the character of the hosting relationships. To our knowledge, this is the first study to interview hosts. Findings suggest that informal hosting arrangements can include support beyond provision of basic housing needs, that hosts sometimes play a social service role, and that youth and hosts often develop family-like ties. Also, youth do not typically initiate: more often peers or other third parties facilitate the arrangement, or the host issues an invitation. These findings challenge the existing narrative of couch hopping as uniformly negative, and suggest that expanding services for youth facing homelessness to support informal hosting arrangements may be warranted. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Child Adolesc.

Family relationships and LGB first homelessness in Australia: What do we know and where should we go?,"Dempsey, D.; Parkinson, S.; Andrews, C.; McNair, R.","Family conflict is a well-documented causal factor in the international literature on youth homelessness. Less is known about how childhood experiences within family of origin contribute to first homelessness among Australian lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) young people. In this article, which draws on an analysis of the Australian Journeys Home survey, we argue that homelessness risk among LGB young people is cumulative and stems from multiple childhood disadvantages. LGB respondents were more likely than their heterosexual peers to report leaving home in the early teens. They were also more likely to have experienced conflict, abuse and deprivation in their families of origin, including: the threat of harm from someone within the family home environment; a lack of adequate food and shelter during childhood; high levels of childhood sexual abuse; and early experience of parental divorce.

Reconnecting Homeless Adolescents and Their Families: Correlates of Participation in a Family Intervention,"Milburn, N.G.; Klomhaus, A.M.; Comulada, W.S.; Lopez, S.A.; Bath, E.; Amani, B.; Jackson, J.; Lee, A.; Rice, E.; Semaan, A.; Kim, B.-K.E.","Behavioral family interventions are an effective way to intervene to prevent negative developmental outcomes for adolescents. Participation in family interventions encompasses behavioral and cognitive/attitudinal dimensions, among others, indicated by retention and engagement, respectively. Two dimensions of participation, retention and engagement, in a family intervention were examined in a sample of newly homeless adolescents and their parents or guardians. Correlates of participation included parents with more income and less perceived family conflict and adolescents with higher endorsement of depression, anxiety, somatization, obsessive-compulsive, phobic, and psychotic symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Stronger therapeutic alliance was correlated with being more distressed (i.e., lower income, more hostility), being a female adolescent participant, and having greater comfort discussing sex with parents. Furthermore, parents and adolescents with greater distress and thus greater need were more apt to finish the intervention. The finding that families who were experiencing more distress had higher alliance scores suggests that there is an additional need for development of interventions for families in crisis. Both participant and provider perceptions are also important in development of a strong therapeutic alliance.

We aimed to analyse the prevalence of HBV and HCV and its associated factors in key groups who were treated at an institution providing health services in Colombia during 2019. This was a multiple-group ecological study that included 2,624 subjects from the general population, 1,100 men who have had sex with men (MSM), 1,061 homeless individuals, 380 sex workers, 260 vulnerable young people, 202 drug users, 41 inmates and 103 people from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Prevalence of infection with a 95% confidence interval and its associated factors was calculated for each group. Confounding variables were assessed using logistical regression and SPSS 25.0 software. Prevalence of HBV and HCV in the general population was 0.15% and 0.27%, respectively; 0.27% and 2.09% in MSM; 0.37% and 2.17% amongst homeless individuals; 0.26% and 0.0% amongst sex workers; 0.39% and 0.0% amongst vulnerable youth; and 5.94% and 45.54 amongst injecting drug users. In the multivariate HBV model, the explanatory variables included the study group, city of origin and the type of health affiliation; for HCV they were group, origin, sex, age group, health affiliation, use of drugs and hallucinogen use during sexual intercourse. A high prevalence of HBV and HCV were evidenced for both viral infections, which was, consequently, much higher within the key groups. The main associated factors that were identified related to origin and type of health affiliation and demonstrated a double vulnerability, that is, belonging to groups that are discriminated and excluded from many health policies and living under unfavourable socioeconomic conditions that prevent proper affiliation and health care. © 2020 Cardona-Arias et al.

Food Acquisition Strategies of Homeless Youth in the Greater Seattle Area: A Cross- Sectional Study,"Kloubec, J.; Harris, C.","Objectives: The aims of this study were to describe how homeless youths access food in the Seattle area, and to describe the nutritional adequacy and quality of food obtained. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2018 and May 2019. Data collection took place at seven organizations in the greater Seattle area at which homeless youths typically access food. Trained research assistants verbally administered an ∼50-item survey to homeless youths aged 14 to 24 years on their general demographic characteristics, current housing situation, ability to access food, and quantity and quality of foods acquired. Each participant was given $10 at the completion of the survey. Results: Participants were 122 homeless youths with an average age of 21.6±1.94 years. During the previous week, 79.3% obtained meals from drop-in centers and 69.8% from a shelter. Most (75.2%) had not utilized a food bank during the previous month. The majority (73.6%) reported having enough food to eat, but not always the kind they wanted, and 75.4% rated the overall nutritional quality of their diet as average or below. Not having enough food or money for food contributed to skipping meals (50.4%), eating less than desired (47.1%), being hungry (45.5%), and losing weight (20.5%). Conclusions: Information from this study can be used to identify barriers that homeless youths experience in acquiring adequate nutrition; to make suggestions for future research and program development; and to help social service organizations improve the network of nutrition services and the quality of food available to this vulnerable population through policy, community partnership, and public health action. © 2021 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics",2021,,J.

Safer inside? Comparing the experiences and risks faced by young people who couch-surf and sleep rough,"Hail-Jares, K.; Vichta-Ohlsen, R.; Nash, C.","As youth homelessness has increased globally, so too has the proportion of young people who are couch-surfing. The risks involved in couch-surfing, compared to other forms of youth homelessness, are poorly understood. Drawing upon intake records from 808 homeless youth in Brisbane, Australia, the authors examine how couch-surfers compare to rough sleepers as well as other homeless youth on the basis of (1) general demographic characteristics; (2) mental and physical health; (3) legal issues; (4) relationship support; and (5) drug use. Couch-surfers were more likely to identify as female, have limited community support, report poor mental health, and indicate more serious histories of self-harm. Rough sleepers were more likely to have legal issues and describe recent drug use. We suggest a need for both increased awareness about couch-surfing risks; and for youth service providers to engage more nuanced and targeted risk assessment in identifying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable populations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,,J.

Predictors of early discharge from early intervention services for psychosis in New York state,"Mascayano, F.; van der Ven, E.; Martinez-Ales, G.; Basaraba, C.; Jones, N.; Lee, R.; Bello, I.; Nossel, I.; Smith, S.; Smith, T.E.; Wall, M.; Susser, E.; Dixon, L.B.","Objective: Although specialized early intervention services (EISs) for psychosis promote engagement in care, a substantial number of individuals who receive these services are discharged from care earlier than expected. The main goal of this study was to examine predictors of early discharge in a large sample of individuals enrolled in an EIS program in the United States. Methods: This cohort study (N=1,349) used programmatic data from OnTrackNY, an EIS program that delivers evidence-based interventions to youths across New York State experiencing a first episode of nonaffective psychosis. The main outcome was “early discharge,” which was operationalized as discharge prior to completing 12 months of treatment. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the association between sociodemographic, clinical, and support system predictors and early discharge. Results: The estimated probability of discharge before 1 year was 32%. Participants who at baseline had poor medication adherence, had no health insurance, were living alone or with nonparental family, or were using cannabis were at higher risk of leaving services within the first 12 months after enrollment. Individuals with higher social functioning were at lower risk of being discharged early from OnTrackNY, but those with higher occupational functioning were at a higher risk. Conclusions: Predictors of early discharge from EISs largely overlapped with previously identified predictors of poor prognosis in early psychosis. However, the association between early discharge and high occupational functioning indicates that trajectories leading up to discharge are heterogeneous. © 2020 American Psychiatric Association.

"Childhood homelessness, resilience, and adolescent mental health: A prospective, person-centered approach","Herbers, J.E.; Cutuli, J.J.; Keane, J.N.; Leonard, J.A.","School districts and other service providers are increasingly aware of the substantial mental health needs of students experiencing family homelessness. Past findings are mixed regarding whether homelessness conveys unique risk beyond the risks associated with extreme poverty. With prospective longitudinal data on homelessness experiences across childhood, we utilized latent profile analysis as a person-centered approach to conceptualizing mental health outcomes in adolescence for 3,778 youth. We considered literal family homelessness as well as families living doubled-up, and we employed propensity score matching to identify a comparison group of nonhomeless students balanced across a range of covariates to address systematic bias. Results indicated that students who experienced literal homelessness during childhood were significantly less likely to demonstrate profiles of resilience in mental health functioning. We considered our approach and findings in light of challenges and opportunities particularly relevant to the school context. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2020,,Psychol.

"Work2Prevent, an employment intervention program as HIV prevention for young men who have sex with men and transgender youth of color (phase 3): Protocol for a single-arm community-based trial to assess feasibility and acceptability in a real-world settin","Hill, B.J.; Motley, D.N.; Rosentel, K.; VandeVusse, A.; Garofalo, R.; Kuhns, L.M.; Kipke, M.D.; Reisner, S.; Rupp, B.; Goolsby, R.W.; McCumber, M.; Renshaw, L.; Schneider, J.A.","Background: In the United States, young cisgender men who have sex with men (YMSM), young transgender women (YTW), and gender nonconforming (GNC) youth face elevated rates of HIV infection. However, racial and ethnic disparities in adolescent HIV infection cannot be attributed to individual-level factors alone and are situated within larger social and structural contexts that marginalize and predispose sexual and gender minority youth of color to HIV. Addressing broader ecological factors that drive transmission requires interventions that focus on the distal drivers of HIV infection, including violence exposure, housing, food insecurity, educational attainment, and employment. Given the ways that economic instability may make YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color vulnerable to HIV exposure, this study focuses on employment as an HIV prevention intervention. More specifically, the intervention, called Work2Prevent (W2P), targets economic stability through job readiness and employment as a means of preventing behaviors and factors associated with adolescent and young adult HIV, such as transactional sex work and homelessness. The intervention was adapted from iFOUR, an evidence-based employment program for HIV-positive adults in phase 1 of this study, and pilot tested in a university-based setting in phase 2. Objective: This paper aims to describe the protocol for the community-based test phase of W2P. The purpose of this phase was to pilot test a tailored, theoretically informed employment intervention program among YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color within a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community setting. Methods: The employment intervention was pilot tested using a single-arm pretest-posttest trial design implemented among a sample of vulnerable YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color using services within a community-based LGBTQ center. Assessments will examine intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary estimates of efficacy. Results: Phase 3 of W2P research activities began in May 2019 and was completed in December 2019. Overall, 41 participants were enrolled in the community-based pilot. Conclusions: This study will assess intervention feasibility and acceptability in the target populations and determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention to increase employment and reduce vulnerability to HIV when implemented in a community-based setting serving LGBTQ youth of color. Testing the intervention in a community setting is an opportunity to evaluate how recruitment, retention, and other outcomes are impacted by delivery in a venue akin to where this intervention could eventually be used by nonresearchers. If W2P demonstrates feasibility and acceptability, a larger multisite trial implemented in multiple community settings serving YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color is planned. ©Brandon J Hill, Darnell N Motley, Kris Rosentel, Alicia VandeVusse, Robert Garofalo, Lisa M Kuhns, Michele D Kipke, Sari Reisner, Betty Rupp, Rachel West Goolsby, Micah McCumber, Laura Renshaw, John A Schneider.

Diversity in substance use behaviour among street children of Delhi under Bayesian paradigm,"Verma, V.; Mishra, A.K.; Dhawan, A.; Nath, D.C.","Background: Shannon’s index is one of the measures of biodiversity, which is intended to quantify both richness and evenness of the species/individuals in the ecosystem or community. However, application of Shannon’s index in the field of substance use among the street children has not been done till date. Methods: This paper is concerned with methods of estimating Shannon’s diversity index (SDI), which can be used to capture the variation in the population due to certain characteristics. Under the consideration that the probability of abundance, based on certain characteristics in the population, is a random phenomenon, we derive a Bayesian estimate in connection with Shannon’s information measure and their properties (mean and variance), by using a probability matching prior, through simulation and compared it with those of the classical estimates of Shannon. The theoretical framework has been applied to the primary survey data of substance use among the street children in Delhi, collected during 2015. The measure of diversity was estimated across different age profiles and districts. Results: The results unrevealing the diversity estimate for street children corresponding to each region of Delhi, under both the classical and Bayesian paradigms. Although the estimates were close to one another, a striking difference was noted in the age profile of children. Conclusions: The Bayesian methodology provided evidence for a greater likelihood of finding substance-using street children, belonging to the lower age group (7-10, maximum Bayesian entropy-3.73), followed by the middle (11-14) and upper age group (15-18). Moreover, the estimated variance under the Bayesian paradigm was lesser than that of the classical estimate. There is ample scope for further refinement in these estimates, by considering more covariates that may have a possible role in initiating substance use among street children in developing countries like India. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,BMC Med.

Think Inside the Box: the Heterogeneity of “in Risk” Among “at Risk” Female African American Adolescents in North Carolina,"Doherty, I.A.; Browne, F.A.; Wechsberg, W.M.","Introduction: An abundance of research investigates the health of often referred to as “at risk” or “high risk” youth from underserved communities and usually racial/ethnic minorities. These ubiquitous terms relate to poverty, violence, and unsafe behaviors (e.g., sex without condoms, alcohol, and drug use). Methods: This analysis distinguished the heterogeneity of risks among African American female adolescents recruited for an intervention study from underserved communities in North Carolina. Eligibility included: ages 16–19, considered or dropped out of school, never completed high school, and during the past 3 months had sex with a male partner and used drugs or alcohol. A variable was created to represent the continuum of risk comprised of history of homelessness, or trading sex, or current heavy alcohol and marijuana use. Participants fell into 0, 1, or 2–3 categories. Ordinal logistic regression estimated the odds of adverse poor outcomes by category. Linear regression estimated reduction in material and emotional support by category. Results: Of the 237 participants, 59.5%, 27.8%, and 12.7% were in 0, 1, or 2–3 categories, respectively. Relative to adolescents in 0 categories, participants in other categories were more likely to report food insecurity (OR = 3.27, 95%CI [1.8, 5.94]); past arrest (OR = 3.56 [2.08, 6.09]); run away (OR = 3.30 [1.79, 6.10]); multiple sex partners (2.97 [1.61, 5.48]); and vaginal/anal sexual abuse (OR = 3.21[1.73, 5.96]). Material and emotional support was significantly lower for participants in 2–3 risk categories. Conclusions: Vague use of “at risk” fails to recognize the heterogeneity of experiences and needs of underserved African American youth. © 2020, W.

Peer Information and Substance Use Decision Making in Street-Involved Youth,"Macdonald, E.P.; Howard, A.L.","In the context of adolescent substance use, peers are a primary source of both influence and information. Substance-related peer information sharing is a relatively understudied phenomenon, particularly in street-involved youth. We recruited 84 youth from a community drop-in center to complete a survey assessing substance use and peer influence on drug use. A subset of youth completed a semi-structured interview assessing factors related to peer information sharing around drug use. Results showed that peer influence was highly relevant to drug use patterns in street-involved youth. Trust in the person supplying information, personal and peer experience, and salience of information played important roles in youths’ assessments of drug-related information exchanged with peers.

"“The least loved, that’s what I was”: A qualitative analysis of the pathways to homelessness by LGBTQ+youth","Côté, P.-B.; Blais, M.","Little information is available regarding how young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals enter homelessness. This qualitative study documents the variations in LGBTQ + youth’s pathways to homelessness via 16 interviews with youths aged 17–25 years. All LGBTQ + youths reported having lived in a family environment marked by neglect, which had led to the loss of self-confidence and trust in their families. These experiences of family neglect constitute the starting point of three different trajectories toward homelessness: (1) being evicted by families that perpetuate heterocisnormative victimization; (2) aging out of youth protection services without a safety net upon exiting; and (3) fleeing from bullying at school in search of freedom and support. Results show the importance of developing homelessness prevention strategies for LGBTQ + youth that consider the heterocisnormativity experienced in their different life environments. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2021,,J.

We compare the race and ethnicity of those experiencing homelessness to the general population and to people in poverty, and we also explore how race and ethnicity are associated with housing outcomes. Interviews with 195 individuals of color explore pathways into homelessness and drivers of outcomes. We find that Black/African Americans and Native Americans were the most overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness in each community, and interview data suggest that factors associated with homelessness for people of color include barriers to housing and economic mobility, racism and discrimination within homeless services, and involvement in multiple systems, including criminal justice. How race and ethnicity were associated with outcomes varied for youth, single adults, and families.

Educational outcomes for homeless young adults with and without a history in foster care,"Villagrana, K.M.; Mody, E.H.; Lawler, S.M.; Wu, Q.; Ferguson, K.M.","Homeless young adults (HYA) with and without a history in foster care in the United States experience lower high school graduation rates than young adults in the general population. Few studies examine the risk and resilience factors that promote positive educational outcomes for these subpopulations. This study explores the factors that are associated with positive educational outcomes for HYA with and without a foster care history. This study uses data from a 3-city cross-sectional study of HYA, which included quantitative interviews of HYA between the ages of 18 and 24 (N = 601) in Austin, TX (n = 200), Los Angeles, CA (n = 200), and Denver, CO (n = 201). Positive educational outcomes consisted of HYAs being currently enrolled in or previously attaining a degree from a secondary, postsecondary or technical education program. This study uses two logistic regression models to identify the risk and resilience factors associated with positive educational outcomes for HYA with and without a history in foster care. For HYA with a history in foster care, city was a significant predictor of positive educational outcomes as well as being an older age, formal employment, not having an arrest record, having a lower score of emotional neglect, and having a higher score of physical abuse. For HYA without a history in foster care, significant predictors included not having an arrest record and having a higher score of emotional abuse. Findings highlight the need for an expansion of federal and state postsecondary education financial aid programs for HYA with and without a history in foster care. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Physical illnesses associated with childhood homelessness: a literature review,"Strashun, S.; D’Sa, S.; Foley, D.; Hannon, J.; Murphy, A.-M.; O’Gorman, C.S.","Background: Childhood homelessness is a growing concern in Ireland [1] creating a paediatric subpopulation at increased risk of physical illnesses, many with life-long consequences [2]. Aim: Our aim was to identify and categorize the physical morbidities prevalent in homeless children. Methods: A review of the English-language literature on physical morbidities affecting homeless children (defined as ≤ 18 years of age) published from 1999 to 2019 was conducted. Results: Respiratory issues were the most commonly cited illnesses affecting homeless children, including asthma, upper respiratory tract infections, and chronic cough [3]. Homeless children were described as being at increased risk for contracting infectious diseases, with many studies placing emphasis on the risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS transmission [4, 5]. Dermatologic concerns for this population comprised of scabies and head lice infestation, dermatitis, and abrasions [3, 6]. Malnutrition manifested as a range of physical morbidities, including childhood obesity [7], iron deficiency anemia [4], and stunted growth [8]. Studies demonstrated a higher prevalence of poor dental [7] and ocular health [9] in this population as well. Many articles also commented on the risk factors predisposing homeless children to these physical health concerns, which can broadly be categorized as limited access to health care, poor living conditions, and lack of education [3, 10]. Conclusion: This literature review summarized the physical illnesses prevalent among homeless children and the contributing factors leading to them. Gaps in the literature were also identified and included a dearth of studies focusing on younger children compared with adolescents.

Building homes and hopes: the transformative service of YouthBuild Las Vegas,"Nehls, K.","Purpose: YouthBuild programs are uniquely designed to address the status of unemployed and uneducated young men and women who are disconnected from work and education. This study, on YouthBuild Las Vegas (YBLV), aims to fill the call for more research on transformative service research, specifically related to education, poverty and well-being. The program educates “opportunity youth” in construction skills while also encouraging progression toward a GED/HiSet or high school diploma. Service providers can better understand how to increase and support reconnection and well-being, especially among low-income individuals in communities with great needs for support services. Design/methodology/approach: This yearlong qualitative research study intended to better understand transformative service within the context of former high school dropouts previously without a path to a productive future. YBLV was an ideal single-site case study because it was bound by space, people, organization and time. The study followed one YBLV class from admission through graduation; the qualitative work with the organization started prior to the students’ enrollment and continued after the students graduated. Primary data collections were interviews and observations. Additional data collection occurred in the forms of written documents, as well as photos and videos. Findings: YBLV succeeded because of service providers’ attention to the funds of knowledge of the student population and adapting the format and structure of programs to adult learners, developing mentors for consumers and acknowledging the context and layers of knowledge that consumers brought to the program. The students were able to experience reconnection and increased well-being because of the service providers’ impact throughout the program. Research limitations/implications: Transformative service research (TSR) research has focused on areas as diverse as health care and homelessness, whereas the lens of funds of knowledge has primarily been applied within educational settings. It would be worthwhile to apply funds of knowledge framework beyond education yet still within the TSR agenda. There are also opportunities to apply the theory to other vulnerable populations. Broadening the scope of reconnection and well-being TSR research far beyond YouthBuild may identify additional or other synergies between these areas. Practical implications: The growing body of research on TSR suggested a gap in understanding how service providers can support consumers in poverty and a need for greater well-being. This study on YouthBuild highlighted the phenomenon among low-income, undereducated, urban young adults and while the goal of qualitative research is not to be generalizable, specific examples such as adapting programs and structures to low-income consumers, developing mentors to model wanted behavior and goal-setting and acknowledging the funds of knowledge that consumers bring to situations, can be generic ingredients for future transformative service projects. Social implications: Research has demonstrated that public investment in programs that assist youth toward a positive trajectory and greater well-being is much more beneficial than disciplinary measures such as increased spending on policing and prisons. Employment and educational training programs have led to measurable success and when disconnected youth have greater vocational training and high school completion, they and the broader economy experience improved outcomes. Therefore, from a policy perspective, YouthBuild and programs like it emphasize growth, development and well-being for undereducated and low-income individuals. Originality/value: The funds of knowledge theoretical framework are new to the Journal of Services Marketing (JSM). That framework coupled with the population of former high school dropouts in a second-chance school and a focus on service providers and well-being within a poverty context, all contribute to the paper’s originality. Reconnection is also a relatively new concept for readers of JSM. These three areas: funds of knowledge, reconnection and TSR are the backbone of this research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,,J. Serv.

Fatherhood Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Alschech, J.; Begun, S.","Research on young parents experiencing homelessness has typically focused on mothers and pregnant women. Young homeless fathers’ tendencies to decline involvement throughout pregnancy and in their children’s lives have been documented and condemned; however, little is known about young men’s perspectives on these situations. This exploratory study engaged homeless young men in qualitative interviews regarding their perceptions and experiences of fathering. Respondents often viewed fatherhood as solely representing breadwinner responsibilities and as a burden that one dutifully carries or shamefully (yet commonly) shirks. Homeless young men’s beliefs about fathering, often steeped in guilt and shame, may suggest that encouraging alternative conceptions of competent fathering while young and homeless is an important area for further research, intervention development, and service provision. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,,Fam.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s Statewide Inpatient Da-tabase from New York for years 2009–2014 were examined to identify pediatric patients <18 years old with diabetes. Outcomes of interest included hospitalization rate, in-hospital mortality, admission through the emergency department (ED), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hospitalization cost, and length of stay (LOS). Other variables of interest included age-group, race/ethnicity, insurance type, and year. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for in-hospital mortality, admission through ED, and DKA. Log-transformed linear regression models were used for hospitalization cost, and negative binomial regression models were used for LOS. RESULTS A total of 643 homeless and 10,559 nonhomeless patients were identified. The hospitalization rate was higher among homeless minors, with 3.64 per 1,000 homeless population compared with 0.38 per 1,000 in the nonhomeless population. A statistically significant higher readmission rate was detected among homeless minors (20.4% among homeless and 14.1% among nonhomeless, P < 0.01). Lower rates of DKA (odds ratio 0.75, P = 0.02), lower hospitalization costs (point estimate 0.88, P < 0.01), and longer LOS (incidence rate ratio 1.20, P < 0.01) were detected among homeless minors compared with nonhomeless minors.

An Adapted Life Skills Empowerment Program for Homeless Youth: Preliminary Findings,"Sisselman-Borgia, A.","Homeless youth are a difficult to reach subgroup of homeless individuals who require a unique level of intervention given their specific vulnerabilities as young people. They experience higher levels of trauma than their housed counterparts and lack parental guidance around concrete life skills as well as emotional support. This article provides a description of the adaptation process of a pilot life skills empowerment program designed to help homeless youth integrate successfully into the community by providing life skills training, emotional support, and social justice awareness. Youth participated in twice weekly group sessions and one-to-one mentoring with community volunteers. The adapted program was piloted in 3 cycles with small groups totaling 20 youth over the course of 18 months. Mixed methods were used to evaluate youths’ experiences in the program. While the sample size was too small to detect statistical significance, scores on validated measures (Antonovsky’s Sense of Coherence measurement tool and the Post-Traumatic Check-list Civilian version) demonstrated improvements in coping and sense of coherence and decreases in trauma symptoms. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative trends, demonstrating that youth felt more confident and hopeful about their futures, were able to set goals for themselves, and begin training programs and jobs. Youth were also able to develop trusting and meaningful relationships with mentors, staff, and peers.

Young men of color in privately-owned public spaces: unexpected findings,"Kronen, C.; Makris, M.V.; Huang, T.-S.","Much has been written about privately-owned public space. Most of the literature focuses on whether these spaces are used, the design of the spaces, and how the spaces can be improved. Researchers have also focused on methods that keep “undesirables”, such as the homeless, from using these spaces. Literature on privately-owned public space (POPS) argues that these spaces are exclusive and undemocratic. However, our research employed an empirical design that centered the voices and experiences of young men of color.

Towards an integrative self: a digital photo elicitation study of resilience among key marginalized populations of sexual and gender minority youth,"Craig, S.L.; Eaton, A.D.; Kirkland, A.; Egag, E.; Pascoe, R.; King, K.; Krishnan, S.","Purpose: Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience unique challenges related to identity and disclosure, and cope in vibrant ways. Qualitative research has not yet fulsomely explored the risk, resilience, and identity intersections that impact vulnerable SGMY wellbeing. Methods: This digital photo-elicitation study (QueerView) recruited thirty SGMY (aged 14–29) from priority populations that had one or more of the following experiences:  trans and gender diverse, homelessness, child welfare, and immigration. From submission of fifteen photos representing resilience and a semi-structured interview via web conferencing, constructivist grounded theory was utilized for multimodal analysis of photos, interview video, and interview transcript. Triangulation, an audit trail, and member checking were employed to support trustworthiness. Results: A visual model emerged showing how participants work towards an integrative self, with themes of reflecting and knowing, discrimination and intersectional challenges, connecting, performing, curating, coping, (re)defining and (re)creating, growing and being. Sub-themes of the impact of family dynamic and values, mental health and trauma, and the cathartic benefit from advocacy and leadership offered insight. Participant images were captured in a digital gallery. Conclusions: QueerView animates the complex lives of multiply marginalized SGMY and their intersectional strengths and challenges while demonstrating the utility of a digital multimodal approach. © 2021 The Author(s).

Youth Experiencing Homelessness with Suicidal Ideation: Understanding Risk Associated with Peer and Family Social Networks,"Slesnick, N.; Zhang, J.; Walsh, L.","Suicide is the leading cause of death among youth experiencing homelessness, and these youth report high rates of suicide attempts. Research suggests that the interpersonal factors of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness are proximal causes of suicide, but little is known about factors associated with these risks. The current study examined the relationship of social network characteristics, perceived social network support, and interpersonal risks for suicide among a sample of 150 youth experiencing homelessness who reported severe suicide ideation. Findings indicate that characteristics of the social network, including engagement in crime and alcohol use, interrupted the potentially protective effects of high perceived social network support for interpersonal risk factors of suicide. Findings imply that increasing perceived social network support as a protection against suicide will not be uniformly successful, and consideration of the social network characteristics is necessary. Future work needs to continue to uncover the complexity of modifiable intervention targets to prevent future suicide attempts among this high-risk group. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Community Ment.

Does the Timing of Incarceration Impact the Timing and Duration of Homelessness? Evidence from “The Transitions to Housing” Study,"Cox, R.; Lahey, J.; Rhoades, H.; Henwood, B.; Wenzel, S.","Compared to their non-homeless peers, chronically homeless adults are much more likely to have a history of incarceration. In turn, homelessness is associated with increased morbidity, lack of access to adequate healthcare services, and decreased life expectancy. This study investigates whether age at first incarceration is associated with age at first homeless experience and with lifetime duration of literal homelessness. Study participants are homeless adults entering permanent supportive housing (PSH) in Los Angeles County, California, that have experienced incarceration prior to their first experience of homelessness (n = 230). Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to determine association between age at first incarceration with: 1) age at first literal homelessness and 2) lifetime duration of literal homelessness. Results indicate that incarceration as a juvenile, and young adult is significantly associated with earlier literal homelessness experiences and may be associated with longer durations of literal homelessness, for adults entering PSH. Moreover, women incarcerated as juveniles and entering PSH first experienced literal homelessness earlier than comparable men. Our findings suggest the need for long-term supportive services for persons incarcerated before 25 years old, especially for women. Moreover, these findings refine the working knowledge that prior incarceration increases risk for prolonged homelessness and can help agencies complete more accurate risk assessments. © 2020 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.",2021,,Justice Q.,38,6,1070-1094,,10.1080/07418825.2019.1709883,,#1613,Cox 2021,,
Mental illness and youth-onset homelessness: A retrospective study among adults experiencing homelessness,"Iwundu, C.N.; Chen, T.-A.; Edereka-Great, K.; Businelle, M.S.; Kendzor, D.E.; Reitzel, L.R.","Financial challenges, social and material instability, familial problems, living conditions, structural issues, and mental health problems have been shown to contribute to youth homelessness. Based on the paucity of literature on mental illness as a reason for youth homelessness, the current study retrospectively evaluated the association between the timing of homelessness onset (youth versus adult) and mental illness as a reason for homelessness among homeless adults living in homeless shelters and/or receiving services from homeless-serving agencies. Homeless participants (N = 919; 67.3% men) were recruited within two independent studies from Dallas and Oklahoma. Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were used to measure associations between homelessness onset and mental illness as a reason for current homelessness, history of specific mental illnesses, the historical presence of severe mental illness, and severe mental illness comorbidity. Overall, 29.5% of the sample reported youth-onset homelessness and 24.4% reported mental illness as the reason for current homelessness. Results indicated that mental illness as a reason for current homelessness (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.12–2.34), history of specific mental illnesses (Bipolar disorder–AOR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.24–2.45, and Schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder–AOR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.22–2.74), history of severe mental illness (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.04–2.10), and severe mental illness comorbidities (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.11–1.52) were each associated with increased odds of youth-onset homelessness. A better understanding of these relationships could inform needs for early interventions and/or better prepare agencies that serve at-risk youth to address precursors to youth homelessness. © 2020 by the authors.

Sexual exploitation of homeless children and adolescents living on the streets in Southern Brazil,"Demenech, L.M.; Paludo, S.S.; da Silva, P.S.; de Paiva, A.M.N.; Fontes, F.; Neiva-Silva, L.","The scope of this study was to inves-tigate the prevalence of sexual exploitation of homeless children and adolescents living on the streets, as well as characteristics associated with this outcome. In this cross-sectional investigation, carried out in the municipalities of Rio Grande and Porto Alegre-RS, data were collected throu-gh interviews, which were conducted by trained interviewers. The Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) strategy was adopted and statistical analy-ses were conducted using Poisson regression with robust adjustment of variance. The sample in-cluded 186 children and adolescents between 10 and 17 years of age, of which 8% reported having been subjected to sexual exploitation. Being 16 to 17 years old, having had forced sexual intercourse and not having bonds with school were characteristics independently associated with this outco-me. It was observed that the lack of contact with school increased the probability 16-fold of having suffered sexual exploitation, being considered the main risk factor in this study. The proposition is that the inclusion and permanence of homeless children and adolescents living on the streets into schools might significantly reduce the risk of sexual exploitation of this population group. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

Objective: This study aims to answer the following research questions: What levels of educational attainment are reported among YEH? What factors are associated with earning key educational milestones? A better understanding of the asso3ciated risk factors may inform future educational interventions for YEH by ameliorating the barriers which have limited their educational success. Methods: This study uses the Homeless Youth Risk and Resilience Survey (HYRRS) dataset, a seven-city sample of 1,426 YEH (aged 18–26) surveyed between June 2016 to July 2017 to study risk factors associated with educational attainment. Results: Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess correlates of earning less than a GED. Foster care involvement, juvenile justice system involvement, CAGE score, and earlier-onset housing instability was associated with lower educational attainment (operationalized as earning less than a GED).

"Youth Homelessness in Austerity Britain: “We Can’t Help You, You Need to Go Back Home”","Ellis, K.; Leahy Laughlin, D.","The growth of homelessness in the UK has been attributed to government led economic reform, beginning with the election of David Cameron in 2010, who promised to significantly reduce the UK’s welfare bill. We argue that these welfare reforms have adversely affected vulnerable young people and placed key services beyond their reach. This paper shares data collected from young people aged 16–21 living in a homeless hostel in England and seeks to challenge notions of responsibilization, which hold young people accountable for the circumstances in which they become encased. Participants reported that although homelessness was precipitated by violence and abuse at home, local authorities sought parental consent before making provision available. Young people described being refused help and advised to “go home” when they reported themselves as being homeless. Despite feeling safe and well supported in the hostel, residents were aware that hostel support was temporary and described feeling worried about their future. Our research highlights the limited nature of services and concludes that vulnerable young people, without family support, are especially disadvantaged by their circumstances. © 2021 The Author(s).

"The confluence of housing instability and psychosocial, mental, and physical health in sexual minority young adults: The p18 cohort study","Loschiavo, C.; Krause, K.D.; Singer, S.N.; Halkitis, P.N.","Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience housing instability, including homelessness, at higher rates than heterosexuals. Few studies have examined differences within SGM populations and intersections of housing and health. Data were drawn from a study of SGM young adults who were assigned male at birth. Nearly one-quarter of the sample reported homelessness, unstable housing, or both in the six months prior to assessment. Housing instability was higher among those of lower income and educational attainment. Additionally, those who experienced any housing instability reported higher levels of depression, poorer self-rated health, and greater gay-related stigma; in multivariable models, only self-rated health was related to housing status. Stigma and discrimination may lead to poorer mental health; housing instability and homelessness may be a manifestation of stigma perpetuated by social conditions and mental health burdens directed by familial rejection.

In this short report, we estimate mortality rates among street-connected young people in an urban setting in Kenya and calculate standardized mortality ratios to assess excess mortality among street-connected young people compared to the general population of Kenyan adolescents. We collected data on deaths among street-connected young people aged 0–29 between 2010 and 2015. We calculated sex-stratified standardized mortality ratios for street-connected young people aged 0–19 and 20–29 from 2010 to 2015, using publicly available Kenya population data as reference. We found that between 2010 and 2015, there were 69 deaths among street-connected young people aged 0 to 29 years in 2013 was 1,248: 341 females (27%) and 907 males (73%). The standardized mortality ratios among street-connected females aged 0–19 and 20–29 years were 2.79 (95% CI 1.44–4.88) and 7.55 (95% CI 3.77–13.51), respectively; standardized mortality ratios among street-connected males aged 0–19 and 20–29 years were 0.71 (95% CI 0.32–1.35) and 5.48 (95% CI 3.86–7.55), respectively. In conclusion, we found that mortality among street-connected young people in an urban setting in Kenya is elevated compared to the general population of Kenyan young people.

"Polysubstance use among youth experiencing homelessness: The role of trauma, mental health, and social network composition","DiGuiseppi, G.T.; Davis, J.P.; Christie, N.C.; Rice, E.","Background: Substance use is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). However, less is known about the use of multiple substances (polysubstance use), or factors associated with polysubstance use among YEH. The present study sought to identify subgroups of YEH based on their recent polysubstance use behavior, and investigate traumatic experiences, mental health and social network composition as predictors. Methods: YEH (N = 1,032; Mage = 21.3) from three drop-in centers in Los Angeles completed an in-person survey and social network interview between October 2011 and June 2013. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of youth based on nine types of substance use in the past 30 days; latent class logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with class membership. Results: Five polysubstance use classes were identified: heavy alcohol and marijuana (33.6 %), illicit drug use (4.9 %), high all polysubstance use (14.9 %), primarily marijuana (18.1 %), and low use (28.5 %). Relative to the low use class, traumatic experiences were associated with membership in every polysubstance use class. Suicide attempts were associated with membership in the high all class (OR = 9.41). Number of substance-using, homeless network members was associated with membership in the heavy alcohol and marijuana use class (OR = 1.35). Number of non-substance-using network members (homeless [OR = 0.29] and housed [OR = 0.73]) was associated with lower odds of membership in the high all class. Conclusions: Distinct groups of YEH can be identified by their recent polysubstance use patterns.

Predicting daily sheltering arrangements among youth experiencing homelessness using diary measurements collected by ecological momentary assessment,"Suchting, R.; Businelle, M.S.; Hwang, S.W.; Padhye, N.S.; Yang, Y.; Santa Maria, D.M.","Youths experiencing homelessness (YEH) often cycle between various sheltering locations including spending nights on the streets, in shelters and with others. Few studies have explored the patterns of daily sheltering over time. A total of 66 participants completed 724 ecological momentary assessments that assessed daily sleeping arrangements. Analyses applied a hypothesis-generating machine learning algorithm (component-wise gradient boosting) to build interpretable models that would select only the best predictors of daily sheltering from a large set of 92 variables while accounting for the correlated nature of the data. Sheltering was examined as a three-category outcome comparing nights spent literally homeless, unstably housed or at a shelter. The final model retained 15 predictors. These predictors included (among others) specific stressors (e.g., not having a place to stay, parenting and hunger), discrimination (by a friend or nonspecified other; due to race or homelessness), being arrested and synthetic cannabinoids use (a.k.a., “kush”).

Using photovoice, participants identified several forms of structural violence that constrain their ability to access adequate and healthy food, including: insufficient funding through government assistance programs to cover monthly food costs; the lack of affordable, healthy food vendors in proximity to the permanent supportive housing building; and corporate policies at restaurants and grocery stores that prohibit the donation of edible food to employees or to people experiencing homelessness. Participants also reported several strategies for adapting to food insecurity, including rationing, creative combinations of food, and scavenging.

A multilevel intervention framework for supporting people experiencing homelessness with pets,"Kerman, N.; Lem, M.; Witte, M.; Kim, C.; Rhoades, H.","Approximately one in 10 people experiencing homelessness have pets. Despite the psychosocial benefits derived from pet ownership, systemic and structural barriers can prevent this group from meeting their basic needs and exiting homelessness. A multilevel framework is proposed for improving the health and well‐being of pet owners experiencing homelessness. Informed by a One Health approach, the framework identifies interventions at the policy, public, and direct service delivery levels. Policy interventions are proposed to increase the supply of petfriendly emergency shelters, access to market rental housing and veterinary medicine, and the use of a Housing First approach. At the public level, educational interventions are needed to improve knowledge and reduce stigma about the relationship between homelessness and pet ownership. Direct service providers can support pet owners experiencing homelessness by recognizing their strengths, connecting them to community services, being aware of the risks associated with pet loss, providing harm reduction strategies, documenting animals as emotional support animals, and engaging in advocacy. By targeting policies and service approaches that exacerbate the hardships faced by pet owners experiencing homelessness, the framework is a set of deliberate actions to better support a group that is often overlooked or unaccommodated in efforts to end homelessness. © 2020 by the authors.

"Listen, I am too responsible! Effect of schooling on sense of trust, responsibility and belongingness to the community of children working on the street in Chandigarh City, India","Kathuria, T.; Pandya, A.K.","Children working on the street are the most vulnerable and are at greater risk of exploitation. Therefore, building the strong ties between the school, family and community of the child can protect the child from various risks and thus can provide opportunities for healthy development. Schooling is instrumental in promoting sense of trust, responsbility towards community and moral values of children, however, in this domain, much of the research was done with youth, not with adolescents. The present study examined sense of trust, responsibility towards community and moral values of school going as well non-school going children (between 13 and 16 years of age) who were living with their parents in slums and spending most of their time working on the streets of Chandigarh city, India. Results revealed that school has emerged as an agency promoting a child's sense of belongingness (F = 4.15, p < .05), school (F = 15.02, p < .001) & family adjustment (F = 6.17, p < .01). Although trust and responsibility toward community was not statistically significant, the mean value of them was higher among school-going children (M = 12.80, ± 2.57) compared to non-school going working children (M = 11.04, ± 4.44). The present study highlights statistically significant positive outcomes of schooling on child's sense of belongingness and adjustment in school as well as with family. Benefits of schooling can be extended through existing Government programs particularly Integrated Child Protection Scheme and Sarva Siksha Abhiyan by linking working children on the street with the schools. At the same time, efforts should be directed towards educating parents or guardians on the importance of schooling; encourage them to send their children to the school and actively participate in children's education.

Lifetime drug use and related factors among street children and youth in Iran in 2016,"Roshanfekr, P.; Vameghi, M.; Ali, D.; Mahzari, K.; Ahounbar, E.; Noroozi, M.","Background: The prevalence and patterns of substance use and its related risk factors in street children are significant for policymakers. The present study was conducted in six cities of Iran to explore the prevalence rate of drug use disorders and their associated high-risk behaviors among street children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016 among 856 street children in Iran. The samples were recruited through Time-Location Sampling (TLS) method. Trained interviewers administered the questionnaires. The applied questionnaire consisted of modules concerning sociodemographic characteristics and risky behaviors. We used bivariate and multiple logistic regression models to identify factors associated with drug use disorders. Results: Of 856 street children participants, 5.28% (CI 95%: 3.84, 7.04) reported lifetime drug use.

Characteristics of street children in Cameroon: A cross-sectional study,"Cumber, S.N.; Tsoka-Gwegweni, J.M.","Introduction: The issue of street children is one of the global social problems rising in low and middle-income countries. These children are vulnerable, but because of a lack of sufficient information, it is very difficult for stakeholders to address their plight in Cameroon. Aim: To examine the situation and characteristics of street children in three Cameroonian cities. Objectives: To describe the demographic, socio-economic and behavioural profiles of street children. To identify challenges of street children and to compare the results from the three cities on account of their different settings, cultural history and challenges. Materials and methods: The study was an analytical cross-sectional survey conducted through researcher-administered questionnaires to 399 street children (homeless for at least a month), in three Cameroonian cities from 1 January 2015 to 30 March 2015. Results: The majority of the participants were boys, more than 70% were homeless for less than 12 months and poverty was found to be the most common reason for being on the street. Most of the participants earned less than 500CFA francs (USD 0.85), with many of them resorting to begging, drug abuse, sex work and other risky behaviours. Only two of the respondents (0.5%) regarded the public attitude towards them as supportive. Conclusion: As children roam the streets in search of shelter, food and other basic needs, their future hangs in the balance. Understanding the plight of street children highlights the need for immediate design and implementation of intervention strategies to prevent children from living in the streets and assist those who have become street children. © 2016.

When Homonationalism Becomes Hegemonic: “Homohegemony” and a Meaningfully Materialist Queer Studies,"Jackson, K.B.","There is limited Marxist, Marxian, or otherwise explicitly materialist queer studies scholarship. While such scholarship is growing, it remains underdeveloped compared to the post-structural strain. This is a serious omission because we need the tools of materialist analyses now more than ever to grapple with incredibly important economic and political issues that are not being discussed nearly enough within queer studies/social movements, such as LGBTQI2S youth homelessness. This discussion can be seen as a modest move in this direction, arguing for the utility of a novel materialist concept, “homohegemony,” to describe, explain, and deconstruct queer new ideological and institutional realities that we find ourselves embedded in, over a decade since Puar’s pathbreaking and incredibly important coining of “homonationalism.” The article theorizes “homohegemony” in order to make a broader case that more materialist interventions into queer studies are needed and have value, particularly in times when homonationalism is increasingly “common sense.”. © 2021 Caucus for a New Political Science.",2021,,New Polit.

At the nexus of two terrains: a critical ethnographic case study of an afterschool center for homelessness,"Pavlakis, A.E.","Little work examines the nexus of student homelessness and afterschool provision. This critical ethnographic case study of organizational culture draws from observation, documents, and interviews with youth experiencing homelessness, staff, and volunteers at a community-based afterschool center for youth experiencing homelessness. It explores how the center straddled the discourses and ideologies inherent in both the student homelessness and afterschool terrains. The center built close connections between and amongst youth and staff and fostered wide-ranging community collaborations, which allowed it to connect youth to various resources and offer flexible programming. Yet, it also suffered from contradictions and tensions in its framing of parents, youth, homelessness, and race. These strengths and weaknesses reflected the center’s position at the nexus of both homelessness and afterschool.

Supporting Female Survivors of Gender-Based Violence Experiencing Homelessness: Outcomes of a Health Promotion Psychoeducation Group Intervention,"Bani-Fatemi, A.; Malta, M.; Noble, A.; Wang, W.; Rajakulendran, T.; Kahan, D.; Stergiopoulos, V.","Homelessness is an important risk factor for gender-based violence (GBV), particularly among youth, and disproportionally affects women and girls. Survivors of GBV experience enduring and severe physical, psychological, and sexual health problems. Although key elements in service delivery for survivors of GBV have been identified, little is known about outcomes of community-based programs aiming to assist homeless and unstably housed youth experiencing GBV. This longitudinal study aimed to quantitatively evaluate changes in mental health and well-being outcomes in female identified youth experiencing GBV and homelessness, 12 months after enrolment in a community-based, trauma-informed, brief group psychoeducation intervention. Standardized survey measures were administered at baseline, 6 and 12 months for 70 participants, recruited between February 2017 and April 2019, assessing quality of life, psychological distress, traumatic symptoms, substance use, resilience, victimization, and sense of mastery. Linear mixed models were used to examine longitudinal changes in quality of life as well as secondary outcomes among study participants. After 12 months, quality of life increased significantly among participants (p = 0.009), and the 12-month victimization score was significantly decreased relative to baseline (p = 0.05). Changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant. Findings suggest that community-based brief group psychoeducation interventions may be a promising approach to improving outcomes for this disadvantaged population. © Copyright © 2020 Bani-Fatemi, Malta, Noble, Wang, Rajakulendran, Kahan and Stergiopoulos.",2020,,Front.

Clinical Trial of an AI-Augmented Intervention for HIV prevention in Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Wilder, B.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Diguiseppi, G.; Petering, R.; Hill, C.; Yadav, A.; Rice, E.; Tambe, M.","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are subject to substantially greater risk of HIV infection, compounded both by their lack of access to stable housing and the disproportionate representation of youth of marginalized racial, ethnic, and gender identity groups among YEH. A key goal for health equity is to improve adoption of protective behaviors in this population. One promising strategy for intervention is to recruit peer leaders from the population of YEH to promote behaviors such as condom usage and regular HIV testing to their social contacts. This raises a computational question: which youth should be selected as peer leaders to maximize the overall impact of the intervention? We developed an artificial intelligence system to optimize such social network interventions in a community health setting. We conducted a clinical trial enrolling 713 YEH at drop-in centers in a large US city. The clinical trial compared interventions planned with the algorithm to those where the highest-degree nodes in the youths' social network were recruited as peer leaders (the standard method in public health) and to an observation-only control group. Results from the clinical trial show that youth in the AI group experience statistically significant reductions in key risk behaviors for HIV transmission, while those in the other groups do not. This provides, to our knowledge, the first empirical validation of the usage of AI methods to optimize social network interventions for health. We conclude by discussing lessons learned over the course of the project which may inform future attempts to use AI in community-level interventions.

Harnessing Social Media to Identify Homeless Youth At-Risk of Substance Use,"Dou, Z.-Y.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Fang, F.; Yadav, A.","Homeless youth are a highly vulnerable population and report highly elevated rates of substance use. Prior work on mitigating substance use among homeless youth has primarily relied on survey data to get information about substance use among homeless youth, which can then be used to inform the design of targeted intervention programs. However, such survey data is often onerous to collect, is limited by its reliance on selfreports and retrospective recall, and quickly becomes dated. The advent of social media has provided us with an important data source for understanding the health behaviors of homeless youth. In this paper, we target this specific population and demonstrate how to detect substance use based on texts from social media. We collect 135K Facebook posts and comments together with survey responses from a group of homeless youth and use this data to build novel substance use detection systems with machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Experimental results show that our proposed methods achieve ROC-AUC scores of 0.77 on identifying certain kinds of substance use among homeless youth using Facebook conversations only, and ROC-AUC scores of 0.83 when combined with answers to four survey questions that are not about their demographic characteristics or substance use. Furthermore, we investigate connections between the characteristics of people's Facebook posts and substance use and provide insights about the problem. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

heART space: Curating community grief from overdose,"Selfridge, M.; Robinson, J.C.; Mitchell, L.M.","This article details the transformation of an empty store into a gallery honouring youth and others who have passed away from overdoses, and the creation of extensive harm reduction and grief support programming that accompanied the display of artwork. The outpouring of community interest, participation, and emotion that surfaced around heART space clearly shows how art, exhibitions and creative programming can help foster communities of care during times of crisis. Drawing from research into practices of care from harm reduction work, grief studies and participatory arts and curatorial studies, the authors explore how heART space comforted youth and others with direct experiences with overdose and disenfranchised grief while creating dialogues with visitors about the stigma of drug use and homelessness. The authors argue curating heART space produced an opportunity for community healing while nuancing and humanizing the way we see people who use drugs. As such, this youth-driven community project created a safe space to share stories, collaborate, honour trauma and transform grief into action. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Glob. Stud.

Improving program implementation and client engagement in interventions addressing youth homelessness: A meta-synthesis,"Curry, S.R.; Baiocchi, A.; Tully, B.A.; Garst, N.; Bielz, S.; Kugley, S.; Morton, M.H.","Background: Evidence on the effectiveness of programs serving unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness remains limited and mixed, and we know little about the factors that contribute to participant engagement and program implementation across contexts. Objective: In this meta-synthesis of current findings on youth interventions, we explore the following research questions: (1) What are common programmatic or contextual factors that researchers and/or practitioners identify as contributing to the successful implementation of an intervention for homeless and unstably housed youth? and (2) What programmatic or contextual factors do youth and practitioners identify as hindering successful implementation of an intervention for these youth? Methods: Through systematic searches of academic databases for articles and reports published between 2008 and 2018—as well as identifying unpublished concurrent studies through professional outreach, hand-searching reference lists, and searches of websites—we screened 1602 studies through two levels of blind review. We then inductively coded the resulting 47 studies that met our inclusion criteria to identify patterns and gaps in the existing literature about implementation and engagement in these programs. Results: Most of the studies analyzed took place in urban settings, were based on programs located in the United States, and included a variety of interventions from behavioral health treatment to street outreach and case management. The 47 eligible studies included 3112 youth and 495 staff participants. Only 3 out of the 47 studies explicitly focused on racial or LGBTQ equity. Two primary themes regarding factors that support successful implementation and engagement were identified: (1) Organizational and system-wide policies can shape the quality and duration of interventions, and (2) Staff behaviors and training are paramount to the success of many interventions. With respect to organizational and system-wide policies, many studies highlighted the importance of fostering a developmentally appropriate balance between structure and flexibility; considerations to access including low-barrier options when appropriate; concerns regarding the physical space of the program; and coordination with other agencies, particularly for effective referrals. With respect to staffing behaviors and training, studies highlighted that engagement with youth experiencing homelessness requires strong communication, a youth-centered approach, and a “flexible, non-judgmental orientation,” that allows youth a substantial level of self-determination. Conclusions: Given these findings, this review supports services that emphasize empowerment and anti-paternalism, and increased attention to racial and LGBTQ equity in future exploration of implementation and engagement within programs designed for youth experiencing homelessness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Child.

"Mental health, suicidal behaviour, and primary healthcare among homeless youth","Labelle, R.; Berthiaume, C.; Daigle, M.; Breton, J.-J.; Houle, J.","Youth homelessness is a complex psychosocial problem. It refers to the experience of young people who live without their parents or legal guardians and who do not have the means or the capacity to reside in a stable, secure, and permanent place. This exploratory study sought to examine the mental health and suicidal behaviour of 76 homeless Québec adolescents as part of a reflection on the mission of primary healthcare. Note that these adolescents are mostly in the first segment of the homelessness continuum and have voluntarily left their homes because of personal and family difficulties. These 43 girls and 33 boys aged 12 to 19 living temporarily in shelters completed a semi-structured interview and self-administered questionnaires regarding stressful events, psychosocial stress, and mental health. Of these, 38 reported suicidal behaviour, including attempted suicide in 19 cases. The results show that these young people exemplify a high degree of suffering and multiple problems. Evidence indicates that lost relationships and academic problems rooted in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are linked to suicidal behaviour. Finally, non-productive coping strategies centred on somatization and little reassurance of worth provided by the social support network are associated with suicidal behaviour. Caregivers in temporary shelters should look out for these factors and refer vulnerable youth to primarycare mental health professionals. © 2020, Canadian Periodical for Community Studies Inc..

"Long-term benefits of providing transitional services to youth aging-out of the child welfare system: Evidence from a cohort of young people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada","Barker, B.; Shoveller, J.; Grant, C.; Kerr, T.; DeBeck, K.","Background: Youth aging-out of the child welfare system (CWS) experience numerous vulnerabilities including, elevated rates of substance use and substance use disorders. Calls to improve services to transition youth to independence are common; however, evidence of the long-term impacts associated with transitional service utilization is scarce. Further, existing services frequently lack appropriate supports for substance using youth and it is unknown if youth are able to access such services. In the present study, we assess the relationship between transitional service utilization and health and social outcomes among a cohort of people who use drugs (PWUD) that aged-out of the CWS. Methods: Data were obtained from two harmonized cohorts of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. Those who reported aging-out were asked about service utilization, availability, barriers, and interest across seven categories of transitional services. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between having previously utilized transitional services and current health and social outcomes. Results: Between December 2014 and November 2017, 217 PWUD reported having previously aged-out of the CWS. Across service categories, reported service utilization prevalence ranged from 16.6-61.8% while unmet demand ranged from 64.8-78.4%. In multivariable analyses, compared to individuals who utilized ≤1 service while aging-out, having utilized 4-7 services was significantly associated with reduced odds of current homelessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.29) and engaging in daily drug use (AOR=0.35) (both p<0.05). Conclusion: Findings suggest that this understudied high-risk population of PWUD and aged-out of the CWS experience long-term benefits associated with transitional service utilization and are interested and willing to engage in these services. However, given high unmet demand, findings also highlight considerable gaps in service delivery and support calls for extending the age of emancipation for all youth in the CWS and in particular, for additional harm reduction and substance use supports embedded into service models. © 2020",2020,,Int.

The Smart City Conundrum for Social Justice: Youth Perspectives on Digital Technologies and Urban Transformations,"Masucci, M.; Pearsall, H.; Wiig, A.","This article employs a social justice framing to examine youth perspectives of the smart city. We examine how youth understand the impact of digital technologies on urban transformations and whether their technology skills and digital literacy give them a sense of ownership over the future of their city. Research was conducted within the context of a six-week summer educational program involving seventy-nine youth of color from public high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The program mixed digital skill building with urban fieldwork to prototype solutions to long-standing urban problems: the sort of problems that smart city policies also seek to change. Our research points to a conundrum for youth. Although they embraced technological innovations, they indicated that digital technologies failed to serve the public or address pressing concerns they identified as problematic within the city: crime, drugs, and homelessness. Instead, in their view, digital technologies delivered the most benefit to private spaces in the home and workplace. Furthermore, the youth did not envision that emergent technologies would improve their neighborhoods or communities but only their employment prospects. This research suggests that the emergent smart city is reproducing actual as well as perceived urban inequities: Wealthy residential neighborhoods and spaces of the new economy become “smart,” but much of the city remains left behind. These patterns create a paradox for youth who invest in digital skills while remaining on the margins of technology-driven, smart urban change.

How hospital practitioners can support sofa surfing adolescents to access community mental health services: An English perspective,"Quintyne, F.; Harpin, S.B.","Informal homelessness or, as Centrepoint describe, ‘the hidden homeless’ includes young people who may sleep on their friends’ or extended family’s couches or floor. They estimate that 103,000 people aged 16–24 in the United Kingdom presented to their Local Authority in 2017–2018 as being or at risk of being homeless. A proportion of young people who experience homelessness rely on their own resources rather than approaching their Local Authority for support. There are a number of barriers that make it harder for any homeless person to access services to enhance their emotional well-being. If a young homeless person presents at a hospital, there is an opportunity for them to be directed to the appropriate support required. This is even more critical when young people have an identified mental health need. The authors will outline ways in which hospital practitioners can support adolescents who are sofa surfing and who have an identified mental health need, to receive community-based support when planning for discharge from hospital. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,,Clin.

"It shouldn’t be this hard: Systemic, situational, and intrapersonal barriers to exiting homelessness among homeless young adults","Sample, K.; Ferguson, K.M.","The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore homeless young adults’ perceptions of the systemic, situational, and intrapersonal barriers they encounter across multiple systems in trying to exit homelessness and the ways these barriers are interrelated. Thirty-one homeless young adults (ages 18–26) in Phoenix and Tempe, Arizona were recruited for in-depth interviews from two resource centers serving homeless youth. Template analysis was used to systematically analyze and code participants’ verbatim transcripts from the interviews into a template (codebook). Characteristic quotes from the interviews are used to illustrate the emergent themes. Findings indicate that structural barriers faced by homeless youth include inadequate homeless resources, employment challenges, discrimination by law enforcement, hot climate, lack of transportation, and legal concerns. Situational barriers include interpersonal relationships, the street environment, and lack of personal resources. Intrapersonal barriers include behavioral, mental, and physical health challenges, reluctance to reach out for help, money management, and lack of desire for stable housing. Participants also outlined multiple ways in which these barriers interact to hinder their exiting homelessness. Findings support current literature applying ecological theory to the issue of homelessness while highlighting young people’s own contextual descriptions of their lived experiences. Three approaches are recommended for improving homeless services with integrated housing, employment, and clinical interventions to help young adults successfully exit homeless. © The Author(s) 2019.",2020,,Qual.

Ethical applications of big data-driven ai on social systems: Literature analysis and example deployment use case,"Garcia, P.; Darroch, F.; West, L.; Brookscleator, L.","The use of technological solutions to address the production of goods and offering of services is ubiquitous. Health and social issues, however, have only slowly been permeated by technological solutions. Whilst several advances have been made in health in recent years, the adoption of technology to combat social problems has lagged behind. In this paper, we explore Big Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to social systems; i.e., social computing, the concept of artificial intelligence as an enabler of novel social solutions. Through a critical analysis of the literature, we elaborate on the social and human interaction aspects of technology that must be in place to achieve such enabling and address the limitations of the current state of the art in this regard. We review cultural, political, and other societal impacts of social computing, impact on vulnerable groups, and ethically-aligned design of social computing systems. We show that this is not merely an engineering problem, but rather the intersection of engineering with health sciences, social sciences, psychology, policy, and law. We then illustrate the concept of ethically-designed social computing with a use case of our ongoing research, where social computing is used to support safety and security in home-sharing settings, in an attempt to simultaneously combat youth homelessness and address loneliness in seniors, identifying the risks and potential rewards of such a social computing application. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,,Information,11,5,,,10.3390/INFO11050235,,#1678,Garcia 2020,,

Receiving a post–sexual assault examination has important implications for HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention; yet, utilization is not well understood. In a population at elevated risk for HIV, unintended pregnancy, and sexual violence, identifying barriers and facilitators to post–sexual assault examination is imperative. Methods: As part of a large, multisite study to assess youth experiencing homelessness across 7 cities in the U.S, a cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 2016 and July 2017. Data were analyzed in 2019 to determine the prevalence and correlates of sexual violence and examine the correlates of post–sexual assault examination utilization. Results: Respondents (n=1,405), aged 18–26 years, were mainly youth of color (38% black, 17% Latinx) and identified as cisgender male (59%) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (29%). HIV risks were high: 23% of participants had engaged in trade sex, 32% had experienced sexual assault as a minor, and 39% had experienced sexual exploitation. Young adults reported high rates of sexual assault (22%) and forced sex (24%). Yet, only 29% of participants who were forced to have sex received a post–sexual assault examination. Latinx young adults were more likely than other races/ethnicities to receive post-assault care. Participants frequently said they did not get a post–sexual assault exam because they did not want to involve the legal system and did not think it was important.

In a probability sample of LGBQ YEH in Los Angeles County (n = 183), we examined subgroup differences in homelessness severity, depression, physical health, and substance use, focusing on differences between bisexual and gay/lesbian youth due to the small subsample of questioning youth. Indicators of homelessness severity were standalone outcomes, and also were integrated as control variables with gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education in multivariable models. Bisexual youth were more likely to have become unaccompanied homeless persons as minors (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 1.85–10.23), and to have not recently utilized emergency shelters or transitional housing at least once in the past month (OR = 6.41; 95% CI 2.41–17.03).

Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional comparative survey of randomly selected 12-14 years old street children (children of Quranic informal educational institutions) in Northern Nigeria while fee paying, private secondary school children served as controls. A simple close-ended questionnaire translated into Hausa language was used to assess oral health knowledge and the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index used to categorize oral hygiene status of the participants. Results: the mean age (SD) of the participating street children was 12.7 (0.86) while that of the private secondary school students (PSSS) was 13.05 (0.96). The majority (89%) of parents of street children compared with that (7%) of parents of students of private secondary schools had no western education. Only 6% of street children compared with 90% of PSSS cleaned their teeth for the right reasons. Only 5% of street children compared with 90% of private secondary school students used a fluoride-containing toothpaste. Though both groups of children have poor knowledge (street children 3%, private secondary school students 16%) on the use of dental floss, the mean oral hygiene score (SD) for street children was 4.42 (0.85) compared with 1.90 (0.09) for private secondary school students. There were striking differences in knowledge and practice with only 4% of street children compared with 69% of PSSS with knowledge about fluoride and its use (p < 0.0005). Also, 2% of street children compared with 40% of PSSS were aware of the benefits of regular dental visits. Sixty five (65%) of street children used finger and water only for tooth cleaning, none of the secondary school students practiced this (p = 0.0005). Conclusion: there is disparity in oral health practice between Nigeria's street children and private secondary school children. This disparity may be attributed to lack of western education and socio-economic status. © Enoch Abiodun Idowu et al.",2020,,Pan Afr. Med.

"Trauma, substance use, and mental health symptoms in transitional age youth experiencing homelessness","Dawson-Rose, C.; Shehadeh, D.; Hao, J.; Barnard, J.; Khoddam-Khorasani, L.; Leonard, A.; Clark, K.; Kersey, E.; Mousseau, H.; Frank, J.; Miller, A.; Carrico, A.; Schustack, A.; Cuca, Y.P.","Objective: This descriptive study examined the prevalence and correlates of trauma, substance use, and mental health symptoms in homeless transitional age youth (TAY) in San Francisco. Design & Sample: One hundred homeless TAY were recruited from a community-based organization to complete a survey on trauma, mental health symptoms, and substance use. Measurements: We used these measures: National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) for frequency and risk level of substance use; the 10-item Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) for prevalence of trauma; the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for depression symptoms; and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item for anxiety symptoms. Results: Almost all (n = 98) participants experienced at least one ACE during childhood, and 77% experienced four or more. Most participants (80%) reached the diagnostic threshold for PTSD, 74% for depression, and 51% for moderate anxiety. Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were all significantly correlated with use of opioids and stimulants.

"The Lavender Scare in Homonormative Times: Policing, Hyper-incarceration, and LGBTQ Youth Homelessness","Robinson, B.A.","Scholars have identified policing and hyper-incarceration as key mechanisms to reproduce racial inequality and poverty. Existing research, however, often overlooks how policing practices impact gender and sexuality, especially expansive expressions of gender and non-heterosexuality. This lack of attention is critical because lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people disproportionately experience incarceration, including LGBTQ youth who are disproportionately incarcerated in juvenile detention. In this article, I draw on 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork and 40 in-depth interviews with LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness to address this gap in the literature by documenting how police and other agents of the state use their discretion to regulate youth’s gender expressions, identities, and sex lives. I posit that current policing patterns of discrimination operate primarily not through de jure discrimination against LGBTQ people but as de facto discrimination based on discretionary hyper-incarceration practices that police gender, sexuality, and LGBTQ people. I contend that policing is not only about maintaining racial inequality and governing poverty but also about controlling and regulating gender and sexuality, especially the gender and sexuality of poor LGBTQ people of color. © 2020 by The Author(s).",2020,,Gender Soc.,34,2,210-232,,10.1177/0891243220906172,,#1699,Robinson 2020,,
Emotional Freedom Techniques-based Therapy to Rehabilitate Victims of Drug Abuse in Panti Hafara Yogyakarta,"Ni’Matuzzakiyah, E.; Isnaningsih, T.","Background: Indonesia is experiencing a drug crisis. This phenomena illustrates the urgency of right and appropriate solutions from various parties as well as scientific disciplines to overcome the global illicit trade and use of drugs and the effective rehabilitation process for victims, so that they will eventually recover permanently from drug addiction. One alternative treatment for overcoming drug dependence and addiction is to use Emotional Freedom Techniques-based therapy, which is a series of methods that are oriented to the body's energy system to release individuals from emotional and physical disorders. This therapy is extensively and systematically easy to understand and to practice by anyone. Methods: this research is a descriptive qualitative study to reveal various qualitative information with a careful and meaningful description-analysis. The strategy used in this research is a case study. The population was drug addicts and drug abusers in Hafara rehabilitation center in Yogyakarta. This study used purposive sampling as sampling technique including inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data collection techniques used were; interviews, observations, documentation in the form of stored notes, and Focus Group Discussions. The data analysis before going on the field was done on secondary data, meanwhile, that used data reduction during the field. Results: through Emotional Freedom Techniques, respondents who initially felt emotional burdens and feelings of discomfort, doubt, pessimism, got a difference. This was indicated by using the Subjective Unit of Discomfort scale, which was a scale of 0 - 10. This was shown that at the beginning, client 1 was on scale 5 and client 2 was on scale 7. After going through a series of Emotional Freedom Techniques, both clients felt lighter, more relax, comfortable on a scale of 0, meaning that they were regardless of the emotional burden. Conclusion: Emotional Freedom Techniques based therapy can be applied to rehabilitate drug victims with effective results. © 2020 Lahore Medical And Dental College. All rights reserved.",2020,,Pak.

“I Know Where the Rest of My Life Is Going”: Attitudinal and Behavioral Dimensions of Resilience for Homeless Emerging Adults,"Miller, B.; Bowen, E.","This study contributes to a growing literature about the resilience of youth experiencing homelessness by examining the strengths of a diverse sample of emerging adults with unstable housing. The study addressed the following research question: How is resilience expressed in the lives of emerging adults who are homeless? In-depth interviews were conducted with young adults aged 18–24 in Buffalo, NY (N = 30), and analyzed using qualitative descriptive methodology. The analysis generated five themes highlighting attitudinal and behavioral dimensions of resilience: (1) perceptions of homelessness as a surmountable obstacle, (2) externalization of homelessness, (3) creation of support systems, (4) maintenance of personal health, and (5) use of music and creative expression as emotional outlets. Findings stress the optimism of emerging adults, the benefits of youth-only services, the relevance of harm reduction strategies, and the underutilized potential of music and creative expression as interventions. Based on these findings, this article provides developmentally relevant service recommendations for enhancing resilience at program and systems levels. Future research should address the effectiveness of strengths-based interventions to bolster attitudinal and behavioral dimensions of resilience for young adults experiencing homelessness. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2020,,J.

"Social Support, Exposure to Parental Intimate Partner Violence, and Relationship Abuse Among Marginalized Youth","Ragavan, M.I.; Culyba, A.J.; Shaw, D.; Miller, E.","Purpose: We examined associations between parental IPV exposure, perceived social support, and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) victimization, specifically in a group of marginalized youth. Methods: Data were drawn from surveys administered to marginalized youth as part of the Healthy Allegheny Teen Survey. Logistic regression examined (1) the association between IPV exposure and social support and (2) how social support influences the association between IPV exposure and ARA victimization. Results: IPV-exposed youth reported lower perceived social support (adjusted odds ratio:.54, confidence interval [CI]:.31–.96). There was a significant association between IPV exposure and ARA victimization (odds ratio: 3.5, CI: 1.5–8.1). However, among youth with higher social support, the association between IPV exposure and ARA victimization attenuated and lost significance (odds ratio: 1.9, CI:.57–6.5). Conclusions: IPV-exposed youth reported less social support; however, social support may buffer the association between IPV exposure and ARA. Interventions may consider bolstering social support for IPV-exposed youth. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2020,,J. Adolesc.

Homeless youth with first-episode psychosis: A 2-year outcome study,"Lévesque, I.S.; Abdel-Baki, A.","Background: Psychosis augments the risk of homelessness, the latter is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Young adults experiencing first-episode psychosis (FEP) are increasingly recognized as being vulnerable to homelessness. However, data on homeless in youth with FEP are sparse. Objectives: To compare symptomatic and functional outcomes in homeless v. never homeless FEP, at admission and two years after admission to an Early Psychosis Intervention Service (EIS). Method: From October 2005 to April 2011, 167 FEP consecutive admissions (aged 18–30 years old), were recruited in a 2-year prospective longitudinal study in an inner city EIS in Montreal, Canada. Socio-demographic characteristics, symptomatic and functional outcomes, as well as treatments and service use data were collected at admission and annually. Result: 26% of FEP were homeless, prior or during the follow-up. Attrition rate was similar among the two groups. At baseline, the homeless group were more likely to have childhood abuse, forensic history, non-affective psychosis, negative symptoms, substance use disorder and cluster B personality. Despite the intensive care of EIS, the similarity of illness severity at baseline and medication adherence rate, homeless FEP had poorer 2-year symptomatic and functional outcomes, although having more long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI) (vs oral antipsychotics), community treatment order and hospitalizations. Conclusion: Homelessness is a serious and prevalent phenomenon among FEP youth associated with worse symptomatic and functional outcomes.

A comparison of frequency of alcohol and marijuana use using short message service surveying and survey questionnaires among homeless youth,"Tyler, K.A.; Olson, K.","Background: There are several benefits to using short message service surveying (SMS) to gather data on substance use from homeless youth, including capturing data “in the moment” and verifying the timing of one behavior relative to another. Though SMS is a valuable data collection tool with highly mobile populations that otherwise are difficult to longitudinally sample, the reliability of SMS compared with surveys is largely unknown with homeless youth. Examining the reliability of SMS is important because these data can provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between various risk behaviors, which may lead to better intervention strategies with these youth. Objectives: We compared past 30-day survey and SMS data for youth’s alcohol and marijuana use. Methods: Interviewed 150 homeless youth (51% female) using surveys and SMS. Results: Past 30-day survey and SMS data revealed moderately strong correlations for alcohol (rs  = .563) and marijuana (rs  = .564). Regression analysis revealed that independent variables were similarly associated with alcohol and marijuana use when comparing survey and SMS data with two exceptions: heterosexual youth reported less alcohol use in SMS data compared to survey data (β = −.212; p < .05 vs. β = −.006; p > .05, respectively) and youth whose parents had alcohol problems reported less marijuana use in survey data compared to SMS data (β = −.277; p < .01 vs. β = −.150; p > .05, respectively). Conclusion: Findings indicate SMS and surveys are both reliable methods of gathering data from homeless youth on substance use. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2020,,Am. J.

Support for homeless young people under 16 years old: towards a new paradigm,"Cooper, T.; Brooker, M.R.","Young people who become homeless before the age of 16 years face particular problems finding appropriate services that address their needs. This has been acknowledged in Australia and internationally, but successful system-wide resolution has not been achieved. The purpose of this study was to find out what would be required to improve policy in this area. The study set out to establish both the nature of the problem, and the nature of the changes needed to improve outcomes for young people. The research documented young people’s experiences of early homelessness and service provider’s perspectives on the adequacy of existing services. These were compared with the theoretical models and assumptions that informed the design of policy and service delivery. The study found that existing policy left some homeless 12–15-year-olds with fewer options and in much riskier circumstances than homeless young people aged 16–17 years. This perverse outcome occurred because the theoretical assumptions that informed policy did not align with either the reality of service delivery or with young people’s capabilities and aspirations. The study concluded that a new paradigm was required to improve outcomes. In addition, more varied types of accommodation are required for homeless young people under 16 years, and, where developmentally appropriate, young people aged 12–15 years should be treated as mature minors, and assistance should be provided through supported youth accommodation services. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2020,,JAYS,3,1,43-64,,10.1007/s43151-020-00005-5,,#1715,Cooper 2020,,

The information was collected through interviews and field diaries. In the analysis, information was codified and categorized. Results: Sexuality for adolescents with experience of life on the street means having sexual relations; these take place due to arousal when, according to them, their hormones increase, or for survival, to meet the needs of everyday life. Conclusions: For street adolescents, sexual exchange with people of the same or opposite sex means sexuality; sexual relations are commonplace for them, they are mediated by taste, physiological need, love, consumption of psychoactive substances or for survival. © 2020 Archaeologia Polona.

Redesign of a homelessness service system for young people,"MacKenzie, D.; Hand, T.; Zufferey, C.; McNelis, S.; Spinney, A.; Tedmanson, D.","Children and young people (aged 12–25 years) are one of the largest cohorts of users of homelessness services: in 2017–2018, there were 81,193 young parents and accompanying children (28%) and 43,200 young people presenting alone (16%). • Children and young people, as well as ‘people exiting institutions and care into homelessness’ are priority cohorts under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NAHA; 2018), and this is carried over into most of the state and territory strategies and plans. • The redesign of the youth homelessness services system is best conceptualised at the community level, as the ‘system’ where interaction between young people and services—including schools—actually takes place. • Thinking about the ‘community as system’ means that small-area data analysis of need, trends and outcomes should be developed into community-level focussed planning of the ecosystem of supports required by vulnerable young people. • There is a strong case in theory—and from practical experimentation—for adopting a system reform agenda that makes the shift from a program-oriented approach to a place-based cross-sectoral ‘collective impact’ framework for support and service delivery for at-risk and homeless young people. • A systemic implementation of a place-based community approach to early intervention involving proactive identification of risk, a tiered practice framework, an extended workforce of youth and family workers, and school welfare/wellbeing staff working under a formal collaboration and within a strong data-driven outcomes framework will begin to reduce the flow of young people into homelessness. • A policy imperative is to fund the development of youth-specific social housing options that provide the appropriate levels of support that young people need, while scaling up rents over time as young people progress through education or training and gain access to employment. • A systemic needs-based implementation of the Home Stretch agenda, which advocates the extension of support for all care-leavers until 21 years, would have a significant impact on a major stream of vulnerable youth becoming homeless. © 2020 Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.

Identifying Homeless Youth At-Risk of Substance Use Disorder: Data-Driven Insights for Policymakers,"Tabar, M.; Park, H.; Winkler, S.; Lee, D.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Yadav, A.","Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a devastating disease that leads to significant mental and behavioral impairments. Its negative effects damage the homeless youth population more severely (as compared to stably housed counterparts) because of their high-risk behaviors. To assist policymakers in devising effective and accurate long-term strategies to mitigate SUD, it is necessary to critically analyze environmental, psychological, and other factors associated with SUD among homeless youth. Unfortunately, there is no definitive data-driven study on analyzing factors associated with SUD among homeless youth. While there have been a few prior studies in the past, they (i) do not analyze variation in the associated factors for SUD with geographical heterogeneity in their studies; and (ii) only consider a few contributing factors to SUD in relatively small samples. This work aims to fill this gap by making the following three contributions: (i) we use a real-world dataset collected from ∼1,400 homeless youth (across six American states) to build accurate Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting the susceptibility of homeless youth to SUD; (ii) we find a representative set of factors associated with SUD among this population by analyzing feature importance values associated with our ML models; and (iii) we investigate the effect of geographical heterogeneity on the factors associated with SUD. Our results show that our system using adaptively boosted decision trees achieves the best predictive accuracy out of several algorithms on the SUD prediction task, achieving an Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.85. Further, among other things, we also find that both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression are very strongly associated with SUD among homeless youth because of their propensity to self-medicate to alleviate stress. This work is done in collaboration with social work scientists, who are currently evaluating the results for potential future deployment. © 2020 ACM.",2020,,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,,,3092-3100,,10.1145/3394486.3403360,,#1720,Tabar 2020,,

The prevalence of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and their relationship with demographic characteristics in children surviving the 2017 earthquake in west of Iran,"Farnia, V.; Davarinejad, O.; Khanegi, M.; Jouybari, T.A.; Salemi, S.; Pajouhinia, S.; Alikhani, M.; Hookari, S.; Behrouz, B.","Background: Natural disasters may lead to personal and social dysfunction in children. Objectives: The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence of behavioral problems and their relationship with demographic characteristics in children surviving the 2017 earthquake in western Iran. Methods: This was a cross-sectional-analytical study. The statistical population included all children surviving the 2017 earthquake in western Iran. The sample size included 335 subjects selected by convenience sampling. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (Parent Form) was the tool used to collect data and chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze the data. Results: The rule breaking (5.3%) and somatic complaints (2.4%) were the most and least prevalent behavioral problems in children, respectively. General behavior problems (8.3%), internalizing behavior problems (7.4%), and externalizing behavior problems (7.1%) were the most prevalent, respectively. Gender had a significant statistical relationship with somatic complaints and attention problems; loss of home with rule breaking, internalizing behavior problems, and general behavior problems; the number of children in a family with anxiety; age of the father with social problems, aggression, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems; the father's educational level with withdrawal; mother's educational level with attention problems, aggression, externalizing behavior problems and general behavior problems; and economic status with aggression (p<0.05) were apparent. Conclusion: Given the significant prevalence of behavioral and psychiatric disorders in children who survived the earthquake, identifying children at risk is important for the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of aforementioned problems in these children.

The objective of this Delphi consensus study was to identify priority needs and at-risk population subgroups among homeless and vulnerably housed people to guide the development of a more responsive and person-centred clinical practice guideline. Methods We used a literature review and expert working group to produce an initial list of needs and at-risk subgroups of homeless and vulnerably housed populations. We then followed a modified Delphi consensus method, asking expert health professionals, using electronic surveys, and persons with lived experience of homelessness, using oral surveys, to prioritize needs and at-risk sub-populations across Canada. Criteria for ranking included potential for impact, extent of inequities and burden of illness. We set ratings of ≤ 60% to determine consensus over three rounds of surveys. Findings Eighty four health professionals and 76 persons with lived experience of homelessness participated from across Canada, achieving an overall 73% response rate. The participants identified priority needs including mental health and addiction care, facilitating access to permanent housing, facilitating access to income support and case management/care coordination. Participants also ranked specific homeless sub-populations in need of additional research including: Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Métis, and Inuit); youth, women and families; people with acquired brain injury, intellectual or physical disabilities; and refugees and other migrants. Interpretation The inclusion of the perspectives of both expert health professionals and people with lived experience of homelessness provided validity in identifying real-world needs to guide systematic reviews in four key areas according to priority needs, as well as launch a number of working groups to explore how to adapt interventions for specific at-risk populations, to create evidence-based guidelines. © 2020 Shoemaker et al.

"Sociodemographic and substance use characteristics associated with typologies and composition of social support networks among youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles, USA","Brown, S.M.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Combs, K.M.; Rice, E.","Youth experiencing homelessness are a vulnerable population with increased behavioural health risks. Social networks are a consistent correlate of youths’ substance use behaviours. However, less is known about the reciprocal relationships among these constructs. This study classified youth experiencing homelessness according to their social support network type (e.g. instrumental, emotional, service) and composition (e.g. family, peers, service staff) and linked their membership in these social network classes to sociodemographic and substance use characteristics. Four waves of cross-sectional data were collected between October 2011 and June 2013 from youth experiencing homelessness, ages 14–29, at three drop-in centres in Los Angeles, CA (N = 1,046). This study employed latent class analysis to identify subgroups of youth experiencing homelessness according to the type and composition of their social support networks. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were then conducted to identify the sociodemographic and substance use characteristics associated with social support network class membership. Five latent classes of youths’ social support networks were identified: (a) high staff emotional and service support; (b) high home-based peer and family emotional, service and instrumental support; (c) moderate street- and home-based peer emotional support; (d) low or no support and (e) high home-based peer and family emotional and instrumental support. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated that race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, literal homelessness, former foster care experience, depression, heroin and marijuana use were significant correlates of social support network class membership. Results indicate distinct classes of social support networks among youth experiencing homelessness, with certain sociodemographic and substance use characteristics implicated in youths’ social networks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020,,Health Soc.

Large-scale spatial network models: An application to modeling information diffusion through the homeless population of San Francisco,"Almquist, Z.W.","To address the effects of increasing homeless populations, planners must understand the size and distribution of their homeless populations, as well as how information and resources are diffused throughout homeless communities. Currently, there is limited publicly available information on the homeless population, e.g. the estimates of the homeless, gathered annually by the US Housing & Urban Development point in time survey. While it is theorized in the literature that the networks of homeless individuals provide access to important information for planners in areas such as health (e.g. needle exchanges) or access (e.g. information diffusion about the location of new shelters), it is almost never measured, and if measured, only at a very small scale. This research addresses the question of how planners can leverage publicly available data on the homeless to better understand their own homeless networks (e.g. relations among the homeless themselves) in a cost-effective and reliable way. To this end, we provide a method for simulating realistic networks of a social relation among the homeless population and perform a diffusion analysis over the resultant homeless-to-homeless networks, and also over a simulated homeless youth Facebook network. We validate the former through novel use of historical data, while the latter is based on recent work that demonstrated that the homeless youth have similar size Facebook networks and usage. We see much stronger spatial hopping and quicker diffusion over the youth network, i.e. we expect information to pass among the youth network much faster than the homeless-to-homeless network. This finding implies that non-government organizations and public health efforts that seek to provide information, goods or services to the homeless should start with the homeless youth, given the potential for faster diffusion when homeless youth are the initial transmitters. Overall, these methods and analysis provide a unique opportunity for visualizing, characterizing and inferring information for large-scale and hard to measure social networks. © The Author(s) 2018.",2020,,Environ.

Paramedic student empathetic attitudes towards homelessness: a mixed methods pilot study,"Prakash, S.; Brown, S.; Murphy, M.; Williams, B.","Purpose: Current statistics highlight the increasing prevalence of homelessness in Australia, however, there is scant research regarding empathy and homelessness in the paramedic literature. Research in other areas of healthcare demonstrates that interaction with the homeless can positively impact empathetic attitudes and also highlights the opportunity to examine if these results are consistent or generalisable to the Australian paramedic profession. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore paramedic students' empathetic attitudes towards homelessness. Design/methodology/approach: A sequential mixed method design study was undertaken using a repeated measures and focus group approach. Paramedic students participated in clinical experience, involving interactions with the homeless. This entailed participating in at least four shifts (11 pm – 5 am) where students gained experience at the Salvation Army Health Café or with the Youth Street Teams in Melbourne, Australia. Empathy levels of the paramedic students toward homelessness, both pre- and post- were measured using the Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) and the Health Professionals' Attitudes Toward the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI). A focus group with student participants was also conducted to obtain further detailed information about their perceptions of the experience. Findings: A total of 20 students participated (100% response rate). Statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases were observed on the MCRS pre- to post- data with total mean scores of 48.35 (SD ± 8.33) and 51.65 (SD ± 5.56), respectively. On the HPATHI a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) increase in Personal Advocacy was observed. Eight of these students took part in a subsequent focus group. Following thematic analysis of the focus group, a number of common themes were identified that included: communication, empathy and rapport, and a change in perception and attitude. Originality/value: The results of this pilot study demonstrate that through participation in a project involving experience interacting with the homeless population, paramedic students showed a greater level of empathy towards the homeless. Increases in empathetic regard, social advocacy and personal advocacy were also found. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,,Int. J. Emerg.

Family first or the kindness of strangers? Foster care placements and adult outcomes,"Lovett, N.; Xue, Y.","We evaluate the long-run effects of placing foster children with extended family, rather than unrelated caregivers. An instrumental variable identification strategy is used to estimate the effects of kinship care relative to traditional foster care. We find former foster youth placed with kin benefit across a host of important adult outcomes, including increases in employment and education, and reductions in public assistance, homelessness, and incarceration. Estimated effects are statistically significant, and robust to multiple specifications. Findings suggest kinship care has the potential to improve important adult outcomes for a large, at-risk population and create large social cost savings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Labour Econ.,65,,,,10.1016/j.labeco.2020.101840,,#1732,Lovett 2020,,
"Residential instability, running away, and juvenile detention characterizes commercially sexually exploited youth involved in Washington State's child welfare system","Pullmann, M.D.; Roberts, N.; Parker, E.M.; Mangiaracina, K.J.; Briner, L.; Silverman, M.; Becker, J.R.","Background: Federal policy in 2015 expanded the definition of “child abuse” to include human trafficking. As a result, child welfare agencies are newly responsible for identifying and providing services for youth in state care who are or at-risk of commercial sexual exploitation. Objective: To describe the demographics, state-dependent living situations, and juvenile detention usage of state-dependent commercially sexually exploited youth. Participants and setting: Eighty-three state-dependent youth (89.2 % female, mean age at identification = 15.5 years, SD = 1.5, Range = 11.7–19.1 years) who were confirmed or strongly suspected of commercial sexual exploitation. Methods: Secondary analysis of lifetime administrative record data from child welfare and juvenile justice systems using descriptive statistics. Results: Youth experienced early and frequent contact with the child welfare system. Youth experienced an average of 27 living situation disruptions while in the care of child welfare, with a disruption an average of every 71 days, primarily due to running away. Nearly 9 out of 10 youth had at least one runaway episode, and for these youth, there were an average of 8.6 runaway episodes. Three out of four youth had at least one juvenile detention episode, and for these youth, the average number of detention episodes was 9.2. Conclusions: We provide the context of a cycle of multisystem entanglement, whereby running away may be both a response to and cause of further system involvement and commercial sexual exploitation, and call for evidence-based interventions focused on reducing running away for these youth. © 2020",2020,,Child Abuse Negl.,102,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104423,,#1733,Pullmann 2020,,
Striving and Dreaming: A Grounded Theory of the Transition to Adulthood for Cross-Systems Youth,"Bowen, E.; Ball, A.; Semanchin Jones, A.; Irish, A.","The transition to adulthood is an underresearched topic for cross-systems youth, defined as young people who have experienced homelessness, child welfare system involvement, and educational challenges. This qualitative study explored processes of resilience in the transition to adulthood for cross-systems youth aged 18 to 24 (n = 20). Analysis of in-depth interviews using a grounded theory open coding process revealed two thematic concepts, striving and dreaming. As illustrated in two case studies, striving was characterized by participants having specific educational and career goals and making strategic choices about programs and resources. In contrast, the dreaming concept indicated participants having little understanding of the steps and resources needed to achieve their goals. Implications for practice include the importance of helping cross-systems youth maintain supportive relationships with families of origin and peers to enhance striving, and the use of motivational interviewing to assist emerging adults in gauging their readiness and motivation to set and pursue goals. © The Author(s) 2018.",2020,,Youth Soc.,52,6,1006-1032,,10.1177/0044118X18791869,,#1735,Bowen 2020,,
Family-level factors to reintegrate street-involved children in low- and middle-income countries: A scoping review,"Goodman, M.L.; Gibson, D.C.; Baker, L.; Seidel, S.E.","Millions of children sleep on the streets every night, separated from family and reliable shelter. Research over the past decades has established risk factors and health outcomes of street-involved children and youth (SICY), which in turn have led to the development of multiple frameworks to guide policy and programming for working with SICY. However, research is also needed to define and evaluate effective interventions to help children caught in homelessness and separated from families. Through a review of implemented programs to reunite SICY with their families as well as relevant formative research on family-level risk factors for street migration, we explore family-level factors relevant to successful family reintegration of SICY. This scoping literature review is structured following a typical timeline of street-migration to reintegration (migration, rescue, reintegration, and follow-up) and uses a family capital framework to explore forms of capital (economic, social, cultural, and health) pertinent to family-level well-being. Associations between stages of street-migration and forms of capital are discussed as well as implications for not only the structure and design of interventions but also their evaluation. The current body of research on SICY, though lacking in evaluation, provides key findings to inform interventions to prevent street-migration and support family and community reintegration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

A tale of four countries: How Bowlby used his trip through Europe to write the WHO report and spread his ideas,"van der Horst, F.C.P.; Zetterqvist Nelson, K.; van Rosmalen, L.; van der Veer, R.","Attachment theory, developed by child psychiatrist John Bowlby, is considered a major theory in developmental psychology. Attachment theory can be seen as resulting from Bowlby's personal experiences, his psychoanalytic education, his subsequent study of ethology, and societal developments during the 1930s and 1940s. One of those developments was the outbreak of World War II and its effects on children's psychological wellbeing. In 1950, Bowlby was appointed WHO consultant to study the needs of children who were orphaned or separated from their families for other reasons and needed care in foster homes or institutions. The resulting report is generally considered a landmark publication in psychology, although it subsequently met with methodological criticism. In this paper, by reconstructing Bowlby's visit to several European countries, on the basis of notebooks and letters, the authors shed light on the background of this report and the way Bowlby used or neglected the findings he gathered. © 2019 The Authors.

"Childhood Trauma, Criminogenic Social Schemas, and Violent Crime","Baron, S.W.; Forde, D.R.","Utilizing a sample of 400 homeless street youth, the study draws on the social schematic theory of crime to examine if childhood trauma (physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and sexual abuse) is linked to the development of a criminogenic knowledge structure (CKS) that mediates its relationship with violence. Results indicate childhood trauma is directly associated with the CKS. They also show that it is indirectly related through violent peers. The CKS in turn is directly linked to violence as are childhood trauma and violent peers. The CKS also mediates the relationship childhood trauma and violent peers have with violence. Violent peers likewise mediate the association between childhood trauma and violence. The link between childhood trauma and violence is also serially mediated through violent peers and the CKS. Findings suggest the social schematic theory offers a valuable explanation for the link between childhood trauma and violence. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2020,,Deviant Behav.,41,8,991-1004,,10.1080/01639625.2019.1596534,,#1741,Baron 2020,,
The housing first model in western social policy aimed at overcoming homelessness,"Kazakova, A.","This review examines research on the innovative social policy model Housing first, which has proved its effectiveness in the last two decades as a means of combating homelessness. Initially applied to people with mental disabilities and then extrapolated to the homeless, the concept has been successful in economically developed countries, has gradually become the dominant trend in the countries of the former socialist camp, as well as changing in the direction from patronage of the most vulnerable people towards the recognition of the universal and unconditional principle of the human right to housing. It is often accompanied by a radical leftist ideology. Most of the studies were conducted in the UK, USA, France, and Ireland. The most engaged authors are characterized by youth and active involvement in practical work to protect the rights of the homeless, discriminated ethnic minorities, as well as women and children. Results of the review indicate that the conscious public demand for the introduction of Housing first is increasing in conditions of rigidly segregated, but non-institutional residence of a large number of discriminated urban minorities, combined with increased repressive measures against them as a result of gentrification processes at the center. The success of the model is facilitated by careful statistical accounting of the types and forms of settlement of residents, including homelessness, as well as by the field model of social services for all categories of people in need on the ground in their place of residence and according to their typical daytime activity. The ethical advantages of the concept include a rejection of all forms of violence and coercion in the course of rehabilitation activities, and, in ideological terms, there is the benefit of reducing housing inequality and improving social justice, as well as bringing economic benefits by reducing the cost of social security. © 2020 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Predictors of Adolescents' First Episode of Homelessness Following Substance Use Treatment,"DiGuiseppi, G.T.; Davis, J.P.; Leightley, D.; Rice, E.","Purpose: A growing body of research has identified correlates (i.e., predictors) of youth homelessness. However, such risk and protective factors have not been identified for youth receiving substance use treatment. Using characteristics collected at treatment intake, the present study sought to identify predictors of youths' first episode of homelessness during the 12 months after substance use treatment entry. Methods: Data come from a longitudinal study of adolescents (n = 17,911; aged 12–17 years) receiving substance use treatment throughout the U.S. Participants completed surveys at intake and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Logistic regression and Lasso machine learning regression were used to predict participants' first episode of homelessness in the 12 months after treatment intake. Results: After excluding adolescents reporting previous experiences of homelessness, 5.0% of adolescents reported their first episode of homelessness over the 12 months after treatment intake. The results from logistic and lasso models were generally consistent. Final models revealed that adolescents who were older, male, reported more victimization experiences, mental health problems, family problems, deviant peer relationships, and substance use problems (more treatment episodes and illicit drug dependence) were more likely to report experiencing homelessness. Hispanic/Latino adolescents were less likely to experience homelessness, compared with white adolescents. Conclusions: The results point to the important risk and protective factors that can be assessed at treatment entry to identify adolescents at greater risk of experiencing their first episode of homelessness. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2020,,J.

Community and well-being: A qualitative study of how youth experiencing homelessness define community and its relations to their well-being,"Stewart, K.; Townley, G.","Prior research with youth experiencing homelessness suggests that community experiences can play an important role in their resilience and well-being. This literature suggests that a sense of community (SOC) and social support may be two key interpersonal factors related to the well-being of this population. However, quantitative research exploring these relationships has resulted in inconsistent findings, which may be due to a lack of understanding regarding youth's definitions of and experiences with community. This study utilized semistructured qualitative interviews with 24 youth experiencing homelessness to explore their definitions of community, how it is important to them, what communities they are a part of, and how these communities contribute to their well-being. Overall, findings suggest that (a) youth generally define community in ways that align with current theory on SOC, (b) youth view community as important, and (c) their experiences within community settings promote their overall well-being in various ways. However, the findings also suggest that community is not always a positive experience for these youth.

Predictors for sexual intercourse experience among runaway female at-risk adolescents,"Moon, S.-H.; Kim, H.-R.; Kim, M.","This study attempted to provide basic data for creating a program to help promote safe sexual behavior among runaway female at-risk adolescents by identifying factors related to the sexual experiences. This study conducted a logistic regression analysis using data regarding 182 female at-risk adolescents, which were sourced from the 2016 survey of Korean adolescents’ contact with media usage and harmful environment. This study showed that adolescents’ age, smoking, and harmful environments are associated with the occurrence of sexual activity among at-risk female adolescents. One significant outcome of this study was the identification of harmful environmental factors and their impact on sexual behavior. Since smoking and sex-related problems among adolescents can act as risk factors for adult sexual health in the future, schools should institute direct and indirect channels for assessing sex-related problems among runaway female at-risk adolescents and establishing proactive and preventive measures for promoting their sexual health. In addition, a social cooperation system should be established in order to assess, and mediate within, the environments around schools in order to minimize adolescents’ exposure to harmful environments. © 2020 by the authors.

Factors associated with sexual and reproductive health behaviour of street-involved young people: Findings from a baseline survey in Southwest Nigeria,"Olaleye, A.O.; Obiyan, M.O.; Folayan, M.O.","Background: To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3, which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all persons of all ages, street-involved young people (SIYP) must be assured of universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. This study aims to determine the factors associated with age- and sex-specific differences in the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behaviour of SIYP in southwest Nigeria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that recruited 1505 SIYP aged 10-24 years by use of respondent-driven and time-location sampling. Data were collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires on socioeconomic characteristics; access to SRH information; contraceptive knowledge and use; sexual behavior; and sexual practice. The outcome variables were inconsistent condom use, multiple sexual partners, and transactional sex. Binomial regression analysis models were developed to determine risk indicators for outcome variables. Results: Although 968 (64.3%) participants were sexually active and 1089 (72.4%) knew about modern contraception, only 300 (31.0%) sexually active respondents used modern contraceptives. Knowledge of modern contraception (AOR: 0.11; 95% C.I: 0.01-0.82, p = 0.03) and being employed (AOR: 0.38; 95% C.I: 0.15-0.95, p = 0.04) reduced the odds for inconsistent condom use among male SIYPs. For female SIYPs, knowledge of modern contraception reduced the odds for inconsistent condom use (AOR: 0.26; 95% C.I: 0.08-0.90, p = 0.03), whereas access to SRH information significantly increased the odds for inconsistent condom use (AOR: 5.06; 95% C.I: 1.67-15.37, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Age- and sex- related factors associated with risky sexual behaviors vary among SIYP. Addressing these differences in the delivery of targeted interventions to reduce sexual health risk of SIYP may be required. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,Reprod.

Navigating Housing Instability and Substance Use: Hidden Tensions Facing Youth in Small Town America,"Curry, S.R.; Samuels, G.M.; Cerven, C.; Dworsky, A.","Recent scholarship indicates that youth homelessness is a significant problem outside urban areas. However, previous studies have not examined how local contexts shape the experiences of youth who are homeless in rural areas and small towns with high rates of poverty and epidemic drug use. To address this gap, this analysis draws from two components of a large national study of homelessness among youth, using data collected in a small non-urban setting in the Northwest including (1) a subset of 41 (out of 215 nationally) in-depth interviews with youth and (2) a subset of 16 surveys (out of 523 nationally) with service providers. We explored availability of services and how youth navigate housing instability and the service landscape in small communities. We discovered that current or prior addictions sometimes posed risks to the safety of youth and compromised their ability to rely on family supports–a support proving critical in the absence of a formal service infrastructure. Our results suggest that youth experiencing housing instability in the context of high rates of drug use and limited formal services must often choose between meeting competing needs: a place to stay versus sobriety.

From 2016 to 2018, San Diego experienced an unprecedented outbreak of hepatitis A virus (HAV), largely attributed in media and public health discourse to the region’s growing population of people experiencing homelessness. Little attention, however, was devoted to examining the experiences and needs of this population, particularly transitional aged youth (TAY, aged 18–24) experiencing homelessness who may have been uniquely affected by the outbreak. This community-based participatory research study leveraged diverse qualitative methods, principally photovoice, to explore how the social and built environment shapes health among TAY experiencing homelessness in San Diego, how these environments may have contributed to the HAV outbreak, and TAY’s perceptions of HAV-related public health interventions. Emergent findings include stigmatization of TAY and other people experiencing homelessness, interventions that failed to address root causes of the outbreak, and interactions with housing-related and other social support resources that limit rather than support economic and social mobility. Findings have implications for understanding how media and public discourse, public health interventions, and availability and delivery of resources can contribute to and perpetuate stigma and health inequities faced by TAY experiencing homelessness. © 2020 by the authors.

An employment intervention program (Work2Prevent) for young men who have sex with men and transgender youth of color (Phase 1): Protocol for determining essential intervention components using qualitative interviews and focus groups,"Hill, B.J.; Motley, D.N.; Rosentel, K.; VandeVusse, A.; Garofalo, R.; Schneider, J.A.; Kuhns, L.M.; Kipke, M.D.; Reisner, S.; Rupp, B.M.; Sanchez, M.; McCumber, M.; Renshaw, L.; Shane Loop, M.","Background: HIV continues to have a disparate impact on young cisgender men who have sex with men (YMSM), young trans women (YTW), and gender-nonconforming (GNC) youth who are assigned male at birth. Outcomes are generally worse among youth of color. Experiences of discrimination and marginalization often limit educational attainment and may even more directly limit access to gainful employment. Though seemingly distal, these experiences influence young people’s proximity to HIV risk by limiting their access to health care and potentially moving them toward sex work as a means of income as well as increased substance use. Work2Prevent (W2P) aims to achieve economic stability through employment as a structural-level intervention for preventing adolescent and young adult HIV infection. The study will pilot-test an effective, theoretically driven employment program (increased individual income and independence [iFOUR]), for HIV-positive adults, and adapt it to the needs of black and Latinx YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth aged 16 to 24 years who are vulnerable to HIV exposure. Objective: This paper aimed to describe the protocol for the exploratory phase of W2P. The purpose of this phase was to determine the essential components needed for a structural-level employment intervention aimed at increasing job-seeking self-efficacy and career readiness among black and Latinx YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth aged 16 to 24 years. Methods: The exploratory phase of the W2P study consisted of in-depth interviews and focus groups with members of the target community as well as brief interviews with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ)–inclusive employers. The study team will conduct in-depth interviews with up to 12 YMSM and 12 YTW and GNC youth, up to 10 focus groups with a maximum of 40 YMSM and 40 YTW and GNC youth, and up to 40 brief interviews with LGBTQ-inclusive employers. Participants will be recruited through a community-based recruiter, passive recruitment in community spaces and on social media, and active recruitment by research staff in community spaces serving LGBTQ youth. Results: In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 participants, and 7 focus groups were conducted with 46 participants in total. In addition, 19 brief interviews with LGBTQ-inclusive employers were conducted. The analysis of the data is underway. Conclusions: Preliminary findings from the formative phase of the study will be used to inform the tailoring and refinement of the iFOUR adult-based intervention into the youth-focused W2P intervention curriculum. Perspectives from YMSM, YTW, GNC youth, and LGBTQ-inclusive employers offer a multidimensional view of the barriers and facilitators to adolescent and young adult LGBTQ employment.

Provider perspectives of housing programs for young adults experiencing homelessness,"Semborski, S.; Redline, B.; Rhoades, H.; Henwood, B.","Objective: Qualitative methods were used to investigate the perspectives of service providers working in Permanent Supportive Housing, Transitional Living Programs, and Rapid Rehousing for young adults who have experienced homelessness. The primary aim was to explore how housing models were designed, implemented, and the extent to which there is variability in how providers approach their work with young adults. Methods: Data come from 26 housing service providers purposively sampled from supportive housing providers across the United States between October 2017 and July 2018. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a comparative case summary approach, grouped by program model. Results: Three themes emerged from the qualitative analysis related to how specific housing models were developed (Stranded between systems: “No model to follow”), the strategies that providers took to support residents toward independence and self-sufficiency (Working toward independence and self-sufficiency: “No one-sized approach”), and the various roles that individual providers discussed fulfilling in their work with young adults (Shifting roles: “Whatever type of figure is needed”). Discussion: While the overarching goals of supportive housing span across housing models, the methods and philosophies of service delivery differ, mirroring the programmatic structure of the model. Results point to a competing philosophies approach to housing as it delivers different philosophically oriented programming models for similar youth through Transitional Living Programs, Permanent Supportive Housing, and Rapid Rehousing models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Interpretation of vulnerability and cumulative disadvantage among unaccompanied adolescent migrants in Greece: A qualitative study,"Mishraid, D.; Spiegeli, P.B.; Digidiki, V.L.; Winchid, P.J.","Background In settings of mass displacement, unaccompanied minors (UAMs) are recognized as a vulnerable group and consequently prioritized by relief efforts. This study examines how the interpretation of vulnerability by the national shelter system for male UAMs in Greece shapes their trajectories into adulthood. Methods and findings Between August 2018 and April 2019, key informant interviews were carried out with child protection staff from Greek non-governmental organizations that refer UAMs to specialized children's shelters in Athens to understand how child protection workers interpret vulnerability. In-depth interviews and life history calendars were collected from 44 male migrant youths from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran who arrived in Greece as UAMs but had since transitioned into adulthood. Analysis of in-depth interviews and life history calendars examined how cumulative disadvantage and engagement with the shelter system altered youths' trajectories into adulthood. Younger adolescents were perceived as more vulnerable and prioritized for shelters over those who were ""almost 18"" years old. However, a subset of youths who requested shelter at the age of 17 years had experienced prolonged journeys where they spent months or years living on their own in socially isolated environments that excluded them from experiences conducive to adolescent development. The shelter system for UAMs in Greece enabled youths to develop new skills and networks that facilitated integration into society, and transferred them into adult housing when they turned 18 years old so that they could continue developing new skills. Those who were not in shelters by age 18 years could not access adult housing and lost this opportunity. Limitations included possible underrepresentation of homeless youth as well as the inability to captureall nationalities of UAMs in Greece, though the 2 most common nationalities, Afghan and Pakistani, were included. Conclusions Due to the way vulnerability was interpreted by the shelter system for UAMs, youths who had the greatest need to learn new skills to facilitate their integration often had the least opportunity to do so. To avoid creating long-lasting disparities between UAMs who are placed in shelters and those who are not, pathways should be developed to allow young adult males to enter accommodation facilities and build skills and networks that facilitate integration. Furthermore, cumulative disadvantages should be taken into account while assessing UAMs' vulnerability. Following UAMs' trajectories into early adulthood was critical for capturing this long-term consequence of the shelter system's interpretation of vulnerability. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

"Urban masculinity, contested spaces, and classed subcultures: young homeless men navigating downtown Ottawa, Canada","Kennelly, J.","This article seeks to address the lacuna in many academic and non-academic accounts of male homeless youth, which consistently overlook and thus fail to theorize the degree to which young homeless men’s experiences are shaped by gendered and classed youth subcultures. The theoretical contribution that this article seeks to make is to bring together culturally-infused analyses with a geographic focus on space and masculinity, in order to expand the repertoire of conceptual tools with which to understand young men’s experiences of homelessness in urban spaces. It does so through an empirical investigation of urban spatial navigations of young homeless and precariously housed men in Ottawa, Canada. Mobilizing the concept of territoriality, as developed by Phil Cohen of the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, alongside the Bourdieusian concept of classification struggles, the article ultimately seeks to demonstrate that there is an internal logic of practice to young men’s navigations of urban space under conditions of extreme inequality, one that seeks to reconcile the deep contradictions of neoliberalism. Simultaneously, such logics may also serve to reinscribe and reinforce their marginal positions in the city, by exposing them to extreme violence by rival urban groups, and leaving them more vulnerable to expanded criminalization by the state. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,Gender Place Cult.,27,2,281-300,,10.1080/0966369X.2019.1650724,,#1777,Kennelly 2020,,
Runaway youth: Caring for the nation's largest segment of missing children,"Gambon, T.B.; Gewirtz O'Brien, J.R.; Lavin, A.; LaMonte Askew, G.; Baum, R.; Berger-Jenkins, E.; Johnson, T.; Jutte, D.; Nasir, A.; Yogman, M.W.; Bauer, N.S.; Lemmon, K.M.; Rafferty, J.R.; Wissow, L.S.; Duffee, J.; Dilley, K.J.; Green, A.E.; Javier, J.; Mathur, M.; Mattson, G.; Montez, K.G.; Nelson, J.L.; Peltier, C.B.; Gitterman, B.A.; Keane, V.","The largest segment of missing children in the United States includes runaways, children who run away from home, and thrownaways, children who are told to leave or stay away from home by a household adult. Although estimates vary, as many as 1 in 20 youth run away from home annually. These unaccompanied youth have unique health needs, including high rates of trauma, mental illness, substance use, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections. While away, youth who run away are at high risk for additional trauma, victimization, and violence. Runaway and thrownaway youth have high unmet health care needs and limited access to care. Several populations are at particular high risk for runaway episodes, including victims of abuse and neglect; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth; and youth in protective custody. Pediatricians and other health care professionals have a critical role to play in supporting runaway youth, addressing their unique health needs, fostering positive relationships within their families and with other supportive adults, and connecting them with available community resources. This report provides clinical guidance for pediatricians and other health care professionals regarding (1) the identification of adolescents who are at risk for running away or being thrown away and (2) the management of the unique medical, mental health, and social needs of these youth. In partnership with national, state, and local resources, pediatricians can significantly reduce risk and improve long-term outcomes for runaway youth. © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics",2020,,Pediatrics,145,2,,,10.1542/peds.2019-3752,,#1779,Gambon 2020,,
"Safe for Whom? And Whose Families? Narrative, Urban Neoliberalism, and Queer Oral History on San Francisco's Polk Street","Plaster, J.","In this essay I reflect on my experience as director of Polk Street: Lives in Transition, a project that drew on oral histories to intervene in debates about gentrification, homelessness, sex work, queer politics, and public safety in the highly polarized setting of gentrifying San Francisco. From 2008-10, I recorded more than seventy oral histories from people experiencing the transformation of the city's Polk Street from a working-class queer commercial district to a gentrified entertainment destination serving the city's growing elite. Oral histories enabled me to document a local past rich in non-biological family structures, which I interpreted through public ""listening parties,"" professionally mediated neighborhood dialogues, a traveling multimedia exhibit, and radio documentaries. The project challenged gentrifiers' claims to be promoting ""safety"" and ""family"" by positing alternative understandings of both concepts drawn from oral histories with transgender women, queer homeless youth, sex workers, and working-class gay men who had made Polk Street their home. © 2020 University of California Press.

Technology-based stepped care to stem transgender adolescent risk transmission: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial (TechStep),"Reback, C.J.; Rusow, J.A.; Cain, D.; Benkeser, D.; Arayasirikul, S.; Hightow-Weidman, L.; Horvath, K.J.","Background: Transgender youth demonstrate significantly higher rates of engagement in sexual risk behaviors relative to their cisgender or gender-conforming counterparts, including high rates of condomless anal intercourse and engagement in sex work. In addition, transgender youth experience increased physical or sexual abuse, victimization, substance use, mental health disorders, incarceration, and homelessness. Owing to these syndemic health disparities, transgender youth are at substantially increased risk of HIV infection. Objective: This protocol aims to describe a randomized controlled trial (RCT), Adolescent Medicine Trials Network 160 TechStep (N=250), which assesses the differential immediate and sustained effects of each of 3 conditions (text messaging, WebApp, or information-only control) for reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among high-risk, HIV-negative transgender youth and young adults (aged 15-24 years). Methods: Participants will be recruited through web-based (targeted social media sites and apps) and offline (print ads and flyers) advertisements, peer and clinic referrals, and street- and venue-based outreach, and by contacting potential participants who have requested contact for future studies. Participants will be randomized into 1 of the 3 conditions: (1) text messaging, (2) WebApp, or (3) information-only control for 6 months. Assessments will occur at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months. Participants who do not show improvements in sexual risk or PrEP uptake at the 3-month assessment will be rerandomized to receive weekly electronic coaching (eCoaching) sessions in addition to their assigned text messaging or WebApp intervention, or remain in the original text messaging or WebApp intervention using a 2:1 ratio. Participants originally assigned to the information-only condition are not eligible for rerandomization. Results: Funding for TechStep was awarded in June 2017. Phase 1 was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in April 2018. Recruitment began in November 2018 for phase 1, the formative phase. Initial phase 2 IRB approval came in June 2019. The data collection for phase 2, the RCT, is expected to be completed in April 2021. As of March 2020, 54 participants have been enrolled in TechStep. The final results are anticipated in May 2021. Conclusions: By providing culturally responsive, technology-based interventions, TechStep aims to improve sexual health outcomes among HIV-negative transgender youth and young adults at high risk of HIV. TechStep will evaluate the efficacy of technology-based interventions for reducing HIV sexual risk behaviors and increasing PrEP initiation, adherence, and persistence. The suite of technology-based interventions developed in TechStep, and assessed for efficacy in a 3-condition RCT, represents an important advancement in intervention science toward developing tailored and scalable interventions for transgender youth and young adults. © Cathy J Reback, Joshua A Rusow, Demetria Cain, David Benkeser, Sean Arayasirikul, Lisa Hightow-Weidman, Keith J Horvath.",2020,,JMIR Res.

An employment intervention program (Work2Prevent) for young men who have sex with men and transgender youth of color (phase 2): Protocol for a single-arm mixed methods pilot test to assess feasibility and acceptability,"Hill, B.J.; Motley, D.N.; Rosentel, K.; VandeVusse, A.; Garofalo, R.; Schneider, J.A.; Kuhns, L.M.; Kipke, M.D.; Reisner, S.; Rupp, B.M.; Sanchez, M.; McCumber, M.; Renshaw, L.; Goolsby, R.W.; Loop, M.S.","Background: Young cisgender men who have sex with men (YMSM), young transgender women (YTW), and gender nonconforming (GNC) youth of color face substantial economic and health disparities. In particular, HIV risk and infection among these groups remains a significant public health issue. In 2017, 17% of all new HIV diagnoses were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact among adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 24 years. However, such disparities cannot be attributed to individual-level factors alone but rather are situated within larger social and structural contexts that marginalize and predispose YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color to increased HIV exposure. Addressing social and structural risk factors requires intervention on distal drivers of HIV risk, including employment and economic stability. The Work2Prevent (W2P) study aims to target economic stability through job readiness and employment as a structural-level intervention for preventing adolescent and young adult HIV among black and Latinx YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth. This study seeks to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability in the target populations and determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention to increase employment and reduce sexual risk behaviors. Objective: The goal of the research is to pilot-test a tailored, theoretically informed employment intervention program among YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color. This intervention was adapted from Increased Individual Income and Independence, an existing evidence-based employment program for HIV-positive adults during phase 1 of the W2P study. Methods: The employment intervention will be pilot-tested among vulnerable YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth of color in a single-arm pre-post trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary estimates of efficacy. Results: Research activities began in March 2018 and were completed in November 2019. Overall, 5 participants were enrolled in the pretest and 51 participants were enrolled in the pilot. Conclusions: Interventions that address the social and structural drivers of HIV exposure and infection are sorely needed in order to successfully bend the curve in the adolescent and young adult HIV epidemic. Employment as prevention has the potential to be a scalable intervention that can be deployed among this group. © Brandon J Hill, Darnell N Motley, Kris Rosentel, Alicia VandeVusse, Robert Garofalo, John A Schneider, Lisa M Kuhns, Michele D Kipke, Sari Reisner, Betty M Rupp, Maria Sanchez, Micah McCumber, Laura Renshaw, Rachel West Goolsby, Matthew Shane Loop.",2020,,JMIR Res.

Safer Sex Communication and Sexual Health Behaviors Among a Representative Statewide Sample of Homeless Adolescents,"Kamke, K.; Widman, L.; Haskett, M.E.","Homeless adolescents are at substantial risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unplanned pregnancy; however, little research has assessed factors, such as safer sex communication, that may protect homeless adolescents against these negative outcomes. Using the 2015 North Carolina Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS; unweighted N = 5,486; ages 12 to 18; 5% homeless), we compared homeless adolescents’ primary safer sex communication sources (i.e., health care providers, parents, teachers, peers, religious leaders) to housed adolescents’ communication sources and assessed how these sources relate to sexual health behaviors, including condom use, HIV testing, and number of sexual partners. Most homeless adolescents (61%), and 46% of housed adolescents reported having questions about sex. Further, twice as many homeless adolescents communicated primarily with health care providers compared to housed adolescents. Importantly, among homeless adolescents, communicating primarily with health care providers or teachers was related to greater likelihood of condom use and communicating primarily with religious leaders was related to greater likelihood of HIV testing. Parent communication was unrelated to homeless adolescents’ sexual health behaviors. Last, communicating primarily with peers was associated with reduced likelihood of HIV testing. Having nonparental adult communication sources, including health care providers, teachers, and religious leaders, may be critical for encouraging safer sex behaviors among homeless adolescents. © 2019, © 2019 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.",2020,,J.

Access to healthcare among youth experiencing homelessness: Perspectives from healthcare and social service providers,"Gallardo, K.R.; Santa Maria, D.; Narendorf, S.; Markham, C.M.; Swartz, M.D.; Batiste, C.M.","Access to healthcare services is critical for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) given their high risk of experiencing adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Previous studies have identified factors that impact YEH's access to healthcare services from the perspective of YEH, but less is known from the perspective of providers. The purpose of this study was to examine providers’ experiences and perceptions of the barriers and facilitators that impact YEH's access to healthcare. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 healthcare and social service providers in Houston, Texas. Drawing on constructs from healthcare access frameworks, findings were categorized into barrier-and facilitator-related themes that reflect five dimensions of healthcare access: approachability, acceptability, accommodation, affordability, and adequacy. The most commonly reported barrier was the high-barrier healthcare service delivery system (e.g., numerous documentation requirements, multi-step process) that YEH had to navigate in order to access healthcare services, followed by the limited availability of free and low-cost healthcare services. The most commonly reported facilitator was building interagency relationships that helped streamline the referral process and provided direct organizational contacts that could be called upon when YEH need assistance. This was followed by offering healthcare navigation assistance (e.g., teaching YEH how to identify healthcare services online) and accompanying YEH to appointments, which better ensured YEH's access to care. Collectively, study findings indicate that the complex way in which healthcare services are currently organized and delivered fails to adequately accommodate YEH, who need low-threshold access to youth-centered healthcare services. Gaps in YEH's access to healthcare services can be narrowed using a combination of administrative strategies and research efforts. These include implementing policies, programs, and practices that incorporate trauma-informed principles in YEH-serving organizations; establishing interagency collaborations to better facilitate the service connection process; and developing and evaluating patient navigator programs designed to increase YEH's access to healthcare services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

"Psychiatric disorders and young adult milestones in HIV-exposed, uninfected youth","Bucek, A.; Mellins, C.A.; Leu, C.-S.; Dolezal, C.; Korich, R.; Wiznia, A.; Abrams, E.J.","The global population of perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children is growing, with relatively little known about their psychosocial outcomes, particularly across adolescence and young adulthood. Using data from a longitudinal cohort study of HEU youth in New York City (N = 134), we examine rates of substance use disorders (SUD) and non-SUD psychiatric disorders (mood, anxiety, and behavioral) at five time-points during adolescence and young adulthood, as well as associated demographic and environmental factors and the association of ever having a disorder with young adult developmental milestones. HEU participants in this study experienced high rates of psychiatric disorders, particularly SUD in young adulthood. During the entire study period (2003–2018), over one third were diagnosed at least once with a SUD, and 69% were diagnosed with a non-SUD psychiatric disorder. Older age and female gender were associated with higher rates of non-SUD diagnoses. A history of meeting criteria for any disorder at any time point was associated with reduced odds in young adulthood of working or being in school and increased odds of reporting incarceration, homelessness, and recent condomless sex. There is an urgent need to develop systems to follow HEU youth and provide services to intervene and treat psychiatric disorders, including substance use. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,AIDS Care Psychol.

Study protocol for a group-based motivational interviewing brief intervention to reduce substance use and sexual risk behavior among young adults experiencing homelessness,"Tucker, J.S.; D'amico, E.J.; Pedersen, E.R.; Rodriguez, A.; Garvey, R.","Background: Young people experiencing homelessness have alarmingly high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is associated with sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, trading sex, and sex with multiple casual partners. Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale. Methods/design: In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n = 200) or standard care (n = 200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period. Discussion: This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.

Building home on a fault line: Aging out of child welfare with a serious mental health diagnosis,"Klodnick, V.V.; Samuels, G.M.","Youth aging out of foster care are at high risk for homelessness. This research explains how and why homelessness occurs among youth with serious mental health struggles after aging out of residential and transitional living programmes. Using a longitudinal constructivist grounded theory design, we analyse 20 in-depth interviews exploring youth's transition experiences and perceptions of transition success within 4 months of emancipation and at 6 and 12 months postemancipation. Monthly 15-min check-ins prevented attrition. A three-phase transition process was observed driven by participant desires and actions to cultivate psychological home through establishing physical home alone away from social networks. Pre-emancipation, the promise of home was privacy and opportunity for self-redefinition. Shortly after emancipation, home became a physical and social space to be, a valuable resource to share and a demonstration of personal transition success. However, later in the year postemancipation, maintaining physical home proves nearly impossible given the risk context. Findings speak to how and why youth aging out appear overly self-reliant upon emancipation. Cultivating a psychological sense of home has practice implications for child welfare providers who aim to prepare youth to live independently postemancipation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020,,Child Fam.

Promoting resilience in street connected young people in Guatemala: The role of psychological and educational protective factors,"Oldfield, J.; Stevenson, A.; Ortiz, E.","Street connected young people (SCYP) are at risk of encountering negative life experiences, such as abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation. Nonetheless, some demonstrate remarkable resilience. This study therefore aimed to explore protective factors that promote resilience in SCYP in Guatemala City. Using ethnographic interviews and image elicitation eight young people and four adult educational outreach project coordinators participated within this study. Three key protective factors emerged that help develop resilience; Empowerment, as educational projects support SCYP and provide opportunities; Belongingness, encapsulated creating positive relationships, a sense of affinity and positive family environments; and Motivation which highlighted the importance of the young peoples’ willpower, engagement with learning and help-seeking behaviour.

Behavioral regulation, critical in academic functioning, is related to parent and teacher perceptions of competence and engagement. Research demonstrates teachers report low-income children and children of color to have less self-regulation and report lower achievement expectations. Objective: The current study examined the relationship between parent and teacher perceived behavioral regulation and academic engagement and competence in understanding the achievement of 9–11-year-old HHM youth living in emergency housing. Method: The current study used objective measures of child cognitive and academic ability, and subjective parent and teacher report of child behavior and academic competence and engagement (N = 86 parent–child dyads and 48 teachers; Child: Mage = 10.5 years, 46% female, 86% racial/ethnic minority). Parents and children participated in concurrent sessions in the shelter; teachers completed measures and returned them by mail. Results: Parents reported fewer behavioral problems on the BRIEF and higher perceived academic competence and engagement compared to teacher report. Parent perceived competence was related to both reading and math ability, while teacher perceptions were unrelated to objective testing. Teacher perceived engagement was associated with reading and math ability. Conclusions: This study identifies important disparities between parents’ and teachers’ perceptions of competence and engagement compared to objective measurement of academic ability. Results suggest teachers in the current sample perceive HHM students as less competent and engaged regardless of objective testing.

Family network satisfaction moderates treatment effects among homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation,"Wu, Q.; Zhang, J.; Walsh, L.; Slesnick, N.","Objective: Limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions among homeless youth, especially considering how their connectedness with their family would impact treatment outcomes. Method: Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18–24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or Treatment as Usual alone. Youth reported their family network satisfaction at the baseline assessment, whereas their suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were assessed at baseline and three additional times during a nine-month period. Results: A multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged model suggests that CTSP was associated with lower suicidal ideation and lower thwarted belongingness only among those with high family network satisfaction. Among both groups, perceived burdensomeness predicted higher suicidal ideation, which in turn predicted lower perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Additionally, only among youth with low family network satisfaction, thwarted belongingness predicted lower suicidal ideation.

The drivers of high health and justice costs among a cohort young homeless people in Australia,"Flatau, P.; Zaretzky, K.; Crane, E.; Carson, G.; Steen, A.; Thielking, M.; MacKenzie, D.","Our study utilizes Australian survey evidence to estimate the heath and justice costs of a cohort of young homeless people. Health and justice costs for young homeless people are highly skewed with median costs well below mean costs. This is particularly true of justice costs resulting from a relatively high proportion of young homeless people having no interaction with the justice system. Having a diagnosed mental health condition is a primary driver of both health and justice costs. Having been homeless or sleeping rough in the previous year is associated with approximately four times mean health and justice costs compared with not having experienced homelessness. High justice costs are associated not only with having a diagnosed mental health condition homelessness and rough sleeping, but also a high-risk of dependence on one or more drugs or alcohol, identifying as Indigenous and a history of out-of-home care before the age of 18. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,Hous.

Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention: A Randomized Pilot with Suicidal Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Slesnick, N.; Zhang, J.; Feng, X.; Wu, Q.; Walsh, L.; Granello, D.H.","Homeless youth have extremely high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, but limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Of interest was (1) whether the proposed sample of eligible youth could be identified, (2) whether youth could be engaged and retained in the prevention intervention, and (3) whether the intervention was associated with reduced suicidal ideation, our primary outcome measure. In particular, youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75). Findings showed that the proposed sample of eligible youth could be identified and engaged in the study, and all youth showed a significant decline in suicidal ideation over time, with a faster decline among youth assigned to CTSP. These findings suggest that (1) at-risk suicidal youth can be identified and engaged outside of hospital emergency rooms, such as in drop-in centers, and (2) intervention added to TAU can strengthen reductions in suicidal ideation. Ultimately, attention towards reducing suicide risk among these youth has the potential to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Cogn.

The need for preparing youth ageing out of foster care for independent living in South Africa,"Shaw, M.; Steyn, M.; Simeon, E.","Children leaving foster care are ill-prepared for life after foster care. They are left to face numerous challenges, such as unemployment, homelessness and lack of interpersonal relationships, which impact their young adult life. The transition into adulthood is a frightening process for any young person, but is most frightening for the child aging out of alternative care, such as foster care, especially if both of their parents are deceased. The South African legislation does make provision for independent living preparation for children aging out of foster care, however there are no guidelines or programmes in place to assist social workers to provide these services to foster children. This is a qualitative study aimed to explore the need for preparing children ageing out of foster care for independent living in South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were done with 12 participants. The findings indicated that the participants felt unprepared for life after foster care and that there is a need for programs to prepare youth for ageing out of foster care in South Africa. © 2019",2020,,Child.

Social support and pregnancy attitudes among youth experiencing homelessness,"Begun, S.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; O'Connor, C.; Rice, E.","Youth experiencing homelessness demonstrate high rates of pregnancy and pregnancy involvement. Many homeless youth view pregnancies positively; some extant research has depicted this group's pro-pregnancy attitudes as a function of youth being in desperate need of resources, such as money, food, clothing, housing, and healthcare. Several studies report that female homeless youth, in particular, feel trapped by their need for monetary resources. Their lack of economic capital may thus cause some of them to go to great lengths, including becoming pregnant, merely to maintain access to supports, especially when pregnancy is perceived as desired by a partner who provides such benefits. However, knowledge of the association between youths’ receipt of specific sources and types of social support and their pregnancy attitudes is limited. Social network data were collected from 1003 homeless youth (ages 13–25). Logistic regressions assessed whether specific forms of social support (informational, instrumental, emotional), provided by youths’ social network members (street-based peers, home-based peers, family members, service providers, serious partners), are associated with youths’ pro-pregnancy attitude endorsements. Multivariate results demonstrated that youth who reported receipt of instrumental support (e.g., monetary resources) from a serious partner were significantly more likely to endorse pro-pregnancy attitudes compared to their peers who did not receive such form of support. Findings suggest a need for creating dyadic communication and prevention activities that facilitate homeless youths’ conversations about their economic resource needs, as part of discussions about their pregnancy motivations and relationship goals, in ways that foster informed, self-determined reproductive health decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Making the transition: How asset building services can promote positive adult outcomes for foster youth,"Nadon, M.L.","Foster youth in the U.S. often face a multitude of adverse outcomes, including low educational attainment, elevated rates of adult poverty, and disproportionately high levels of adult homelessness. One newer area of social policy research and advocacy, asset building, may help explain some of these disparities. Foster youth face several barriers to asset building. For example, many youth have several placements during their stay in care, resulting in youth receiving inconsistent schooling, mentoring, and support, and facing limited opportunities to work, save money, or build academic and professional networks. This paper examines the frequency with which transition-age foster youth receive asset building services and whether the youth who receive services experience improved outcomes compared to those who do not. Analyzing data from the National Youth in Transition Database and using a Propensity Score Matching methodology, this study finds that youth receiving Budgeting and Financial Education Services and Post-Secondary Education Services experience significantly improved outcomes, including reduced likelihood of homelessness and increased likelihood of employment and educational enrollment. However, only 29% of youth receive Budgeting and Financial Education Services, and only 19% of youth receive Post-Secondary Education Services. Service receipt also covaries with demographics, including race/ethnicity and education level. These findings have noteworthy implications for both policy and practice as asset building for foster youth is a potentially promising realm for public service expansion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Foster care youth and the development of autonomy,"Barnett, S.","Homelessness, unemployment, and food insecurity are the unfortunate reality for many young adults who age out of the foster care system. These rates remain high even for youth who participate in independent living programmes prior to exiting foster care. These high rates of poor outcomes suggest that many foster care youth are inadequately prepared to transition to adulthood. In order to improve services for youth preparing to age out of foster care, it is important to identify factors that contribute to these adverse outcomes and that could become targets of further interventions. One such factor, an underdeveloped sense of autonomy, may predispose youth to poor outcomes such as limited educational attainment, unstable housing, and unemployment. At least in Western cultures that value individualism, interventions that foster the development of autonomy during adolescence could potentially improve outcomes for youth in foster care. This article aims to review factors that promote the development of autonomy and discusses the unique barriers to autonomy development faced by youth in foster care. I conclude with several intervention strategies that could facilitate the development of autonomy in foster care youth and recommendations for future research. © 2020, © 2020 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.",2020,,Int.

"Diphtheria-tetanus-polio, measles-mumps-rubella, and hepatitis b vaccination coverage and associated factors among homeless children in the paris region in 2013: Results from the ENFAMS survey","Mansor-Lefebvre, S.; Le Strat, Y.; Bernadou, A.; Vignier, N.; Jean-Paul, G.; Arnaud, A.; Lévy-Bruhl, D.; Vandentorren, S.","Background: The number of homeless families has increased considerably since the 1990s in France. We aimed to estimate the homeless children vaccination coverage (VC) for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles–mumps–rubella and hepatitis B and identify factors associated with insuffcient VC according to birthplace. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among homeless shelter families in the greater Paris area. A nurse conducted face-to-face interviews and collected vaccination records. We analyzed factors associated with insuffcient VC, stratified by birthplace and vaccine, using robust Poisson regression. Results: The study included 214 children born in France and 236 born outside France. VC in French-born homeless children was high (>90% at 24 months for most vaccinations) and similar to levels observed in the general population, whereas VC in those born outside France was low (<50% at 24 months for all vaccines). Factors significantly associated with insuffcient VC among children born outside France were age, parents with French-language diffculties, and changing residence at least twice in the previous year. Children in contact with the healthcare system at least once in the previous year had significantly higher VC, irrespective of vaccine and birthplace. Conclusion: Special attention should be paid to homeless children born outside France, with recent European and French recommendations confirming the need for catch-up vaccination in children with undocumented VC. © 2020 by the authors.

"Children’s nutrition status based on streetism, mobility, and social cohesion perspective in Makassar (Study epidemiology analytic)",,"Background. Changes in community structure from argument to industry and lifestyle changes, socio-economic societies are suspected as a backdrop to the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases, so that the incidence of non-communicable diseases varies greatly in epidemiological transitions. One of the epidemiological problems that often arises is the problem of child nutrition. Street children nutrition is very concern in Makassar City. Street children in Makassar city are increasing every year. This was seen in 2014 the number of street children was 220, in 2015 there were 250 children, while in 2016 it increased to 305 street children. Street children are at risk of suffering from nutritional disorders. The nutritional status of street children is very dependent on mobility, streetism, mobility, and social cohesion. The study was conducted with the aim of analyzing the nutritional status of street children based on the perspective of streetism, mobility and social cohesion in Makassar. The benefits of this research are expected to be able to develop theories and concepts regarding the nutritional status of street children based on epidemiological studies. Material and Methods The type of research used was an observational method in a cross-sectional study design. The sampling method uses simple random sampling. The study was conducted in September-January 2020. The number of sampling was 90 people. The population and research sample are street children in Makassar City. The data analysis technique used in this study is Chi-square. Results. There is an influence of streetism and social cohesion on street children in Makassar. The results of the analysis of the relationship between streetism, mobility and social cohesion with the nutritional status of street children found that streetism p (0,000) <p (0.05), mobilitas p (0,075) p > (0,05), kohesi social p (0,075) p > (0,05). Conclusion. Streetism has a very significant influence on the status of street children in Makassar. It is recommended that the social service and health office work together with halfway houses to provide information on nutrition to street children so that they understand about nutritious food, healthy eating patterns. © 2020, Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology.

Community-based oral health interventions for people experiencing homelessness: A scoping review,"Beaton, L.; Humphris, G.; Rodriguez, A.; Freeman, R.","Objective: To determine the characteristics of community-based oral health interventions for people experiencing homelessness. Basic research design: A scoping review was conducted, adhering to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: Scoping Reviews) checklist. A search strategy was developed using MeSH terms and key words, and used to search the following electronic databases: Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest Assia, Scopus, Web of Science and PsychNet. Key journals and reference lists were also hand-searched. Two reviewers then read the abstracts of all papers, excluding duplicates and papers that did not meet the eligibility criteria. The reviewers then read to full-texts of the studies to be included in the review. Results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. These studies were predominantly evaluations of community-based dental services or other oral health interventions. Several recommendations were extracted. Interventions should involve co-design with homeless service users; multidisciplinary working, collaboration with dental practitioners, and working with educational establishments. The location of community-based services was also found to be of importance. Conclusion: This review has highlighted several recommendations, as well as gaps in the literature. These gaps suggest a need for more non-clinical oral health interventions for the homeless population, and a closer look at the role that non-dental practitioners can play in the delivery of oral health care. © BASCD 2020.",2020,,Community Dent.

"Housing Instability, Depression, and HIV Viral Load among Young Black Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men in Atlanta, Georgia","Solomon, H.; Linton, S.L.; del Rio, C.; Hussen, S.A.","Housing instability is common among sexual minority youth. Research suggests that psychological distress, such as depression, may mediate the association between housing instability and poor HIV-related outcomes, but this hypothesis remains underexplored. Housing instability was assessed using two variables (residential moves in 6 months, and self-reported homelessness at any time since age 15 years). We examined cross-sectional relationships between the housing instability variables and detectable HIV-1 viral load (VL) in a sample of young Black gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) living with HIV (N 5 81) in Atlanta, GA, in 2015–2016. Additionally, we explored whether depressive symptoms mediated this relationship. Our exploratory study suggests that psychological distress may partially mediate the association between housing instability and detectable VL. In addition to structural interventions that ensure housing stability, increasing use of mental health services by unstably housed YB-GBMSM may improve VL suppression in this high-risk population.

Implementing a trauma-informed intervention for homeless female survivors of gender-based violence: Lessons learned in a large Canadian urban centre,"Kahan, D.; Lamanna, D.; Rajakulendran, T.; Noble, A.; Stergiopoulos, V.","Gender-based violence is associated with an elevated risk of physical and psychological harm for girls and women. This study examines service user and provider experiences of a trauma-informed, peer-facilitated group psychosocial intervention (Peer Education and Connection through Empowerment [PEACE]) targeting female-identified youth experiencing homelessness and gender-based violence. Participants were recruited among service users and providers of the intervention, delivered in Toronto, Canada. We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews between May and October 2017, engaging 12 service users and 7 additional stakeholders (including social service providers, peers and program administrators). We elicited participant perspectives on the acceptability of the intervention and key enablers of successful implementation and engagement of the target population. Qualitative transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Service users, including survivors of sexual exploitation, forced marriage and honour crimes, described satisfaction with and acceptability of the intervention. A number of factors were perceived by service users and providers as contributing to the intervention's successful implementation, including a focus on service user needs, program quality, flexibility and accessibility and strong inter-and intra-agency networks. Introducing peers as mentors led to challenges that could be mitigated through peer mentor education and training to maintain healthy boundaries and enhance peer mentor retention. The need for clear guidelines on the management of trauma disclosures in community settings and a systems-wide approach to service provider and administrator training in the effective integration of peer support services also emerged as important areas for future development. A group-based, trauma-informed and peer-supported psychosocial intervention was acceptable to service users and providers and successfully engaged female-identified survivors of gender-based violence who were also experiencing homelessness. Findings add to the scant knowledge base on interventions to support this population and identify important areas for future research. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020,,Health Soc.

The functional patterns of adolescent mothers leaving foster care: Results from a cluster analysis,"Shpiegel, S.; Aparicio, E.M.; King, B.; Prince, D.; Lynch, J.; Grinnell-Davis, C.L.","Few studies have explored the outcomes of adolescent mothers leaving foster care, especially using person-oriented methods. The current study employed a cluster analysis to identify unique patterns of functioning among adolescent mothers aged 19 (n = 777). Data from the National Youth in Transition Database and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System were utilized. Findings revealed five subpopulations characterized by distinct constellations of outcomes at age 19. The largest group (43%) exhibited competent functioning across all the domains studied—its members were connected to school and/or employment and did not experience homelessness, substance abuse referrals, or incarceration during the past 2 years (i.e., “resilient”). A relatively small group (12%) exhibited challenges across all the above-referenced domains, whereas the remaining groups presented challenges in some domains, but not in others. Follow-up analyses revealed that adolescent mothers classified as resilient at age 19 had the lowest rates of congregate care placements and the highest rates of nonrelative foster care placements at age 17. Moreover, they had lower placement instability and higher rates of extended foster care as compared with members of the other clusters.

Making the Prevention of Homelessness a Priority: The Role of Social Innovation,"Gaetz, S.","Mass homelessness emerged in Canada in the wake of neoliberal policies that reduced government production of housing and other supportive measures. Efforts to reduce homelessness have occurred in three stages: 1) an emergency response in the 1990s that consisted mostly of investment in shelters, soup kitchens, and day programs, 2) the implementation of community plans to end homelessness, combined with the adoption of Housing First as a strategy that seeks to provide reliable shelter as a first step to anyone without it, followed by other remedial services, and 3) the recent development in Canada of early intervention strategies to prevent homelessness from its inception. The second stage was highly successful in dealing with the situation of chronically homeless adults, and many communities have begun to see reductions in homelessness. However effective, this approach does not break the cycle by intercepting potentially homeless individuals in their youth, which is when it begins for many people. Canada is at the beginning stages of the move towards a stronger focus on prevention, aided by a social innovation agenda to identify, design, test, and evaluate preventive interventions to determine which ones will be most strategically effective, setting the stage for implementation and going to scale. © 2020 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc",2020,,Am.

"Mental health outcomes among homeless, runaway, and stably housed youth","Gewirtz O’Brien, J.R.; Edinburgh, L.D.; Barnes, A.J.; McRee, A.-L.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Runaway youth and homeless youth are at risk for adverse mental health outcomes. These 2 populations are frequently pooled together in both research and interventions yet may have unique health needs. We sought to assess differences in mental health outcomes among these populations. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of ninth- and 11th-graders in the 2016 minnesota Student Survey (n = 68 785). We categorized youth into 4 subgroups based on housing status in the previous year: (1) unaccompanied homeless youth (0.5%), (2) runaway youth (4%), (3) youth who had both run away and been homeless (0.6%), and (4) stably housed youth (95%). We performed multivariable logistic regression to compare 4 mental health outcomes (self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and depressive symptoms) across groups, controlling for demographics and abuse history. RESULTS: Unstably housed youth had poorer mental health outcomes when compared with their stably housed peers (P, .05). For example, 11% of homeless youth, 20% of runaways, and 33% of youth who had experienced both had attempted suicide in the previous year compared with 2% of stably housed youth (adjusted odds ratios 2.4, 4.9, and 7.1, respectively). Other outcomes showed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that runaway and homeless youth represent unique populations with high levels of mental health needs who would benefit from targeted clinical and community interventions.

"Homeless young people ‘strategizing’ a route to housing stability: service fatigue, exiting attempts and living ‘off grid’","Mayock, P.; Parker, S.","While access to housing has been identified as a crucial enabler to young people exiting homelessness, relatively little is known about the experiences of youth who encounter barriers in their attempts to secure housing. Mobilizing a pathways approach, this paper examines homeless young people’s experiences of seeking housing in a context of housing market forces that blocked their efforts to carve a route out of homelessness. The research, which is biographical and longitudinal, was conducted in Ireland between 2013 and 2016 and involved the collection of data at two points in time. At baseline, 40 young people aged 16–24 years and 10 of their family members were recruited (Phase 1) and, at the point of follow-up two years later (Phase 2), 74% of participants were retained in the study. By Phase 2, just 24% of the study’s young people were housed, pointing to significant barriers of access to housing. Moving beyond the identification of the impact of housing market forces on young people’s ability to exit homelessness, the analysis examines young people’s responses, focussing on the strategies used by them as they attempted to reclaim autonomy and control over their housing futures. Implications for the development of sustainable housing solutions that specifically cater to the needs of homeless youth are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,Hous.

Adapting a family intervention to reduce risk factors for sexual exploitation,"Bounds, D.T.; Otwell, C.H.; Melendez, A.; Karnik, N.S.; Julion, W.A.","Background: Sexually exploited youth are disconnected from societal tethers and need support systems, which makes them some of the most vulnerable of youth. This heightened level of vulnerability increases their risk for violence, abuse, ongoing sexual exploitation and all its sequelae. The purpose of this study was to examine an evidence-based intervention called STRIVE (support to reunite, involve and value each other) that has been a successful family re-engagement strategy with newly homeless youth. We sought to explore its contextual relevance for youth with risk factors for sexual exploitation and identify necessary adaptations to reduce risk factors for sexual exploitation. We deliberately took an intersectional approach in conducting this study. Methods: Six community-based focus groups were conducted with youth at risk for sexual exploitation and their service providers. Each group was recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. Results: Results from 29 youth and 11 providers indicate that there are unique considerations that must be taken into account while working with youth at risk for sexual exploitation to ensure effective service delivery and/or ethical research. Emergent themes included: setting the stage by building rapport and acknowledging experiences of structural violence, protect and hold which balances youth's need for advocacy/support with their caregivers' need for validation/understanding, and walking the safety tightrope by assessing risks and safety planning. Discussion: Focus groups are an effective methodology when working with traditionally disempowered populations particularly in gaining a range of perspectives to meet unique needs/preferences.

This study examines the relationship between having a biological child and drug use among youth experiencing homelessness. Method: We used 4 waves of cross-sectional data from 1,010 youths ages 14–26 at 3 drop-in agencies serving youth experiencing homeless in Los Angeles, CA. Among participants, 23.8% of males and 28.9% of females had a biological child. We conducted multivariate logistic regression models for males and females on 4 substance use behaviors in the past month: binge drinking, using hard/illicit drugs, prescription drug misuse, and injection drug use. Results: Fathers had greater odds of hard drug use, prescription drug misuse, and injection drug use than males without children. There was no significant relationship between having a child and any of the four substance use behaviors for females. Conclusions: Findings suggest that having a child is not associated with higher risk of dangerous or illicit substance use for females.

Motivation to quit cigarettes and alternative tobacco products: prevalence and correlates among youth experiencing homelessness,"Tucker, J.S.; Shadel, W.G.; Golinelli, D.; Seelam, R.; Siconolfi, D.","Use of alternative tobacco products, as well as regular cigarettes, is widespread among unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness. However, little is known about their level of motivation for quitting use of these products, factors associated with motivation to quit, or how these might vary by type of tobacco product. Unaccompanied homeless youth were sampled from 25 street and service sites in Los Angeles County (N = 469). All participants were past month tobacco users who completed a survey on their tobacco-related behaviors and cognitions, including motivation to quit, as well as background characteristics. Among self-reported users of each product, motivation to quit in the next 30 days was highest for regular cigarettes (33%), followed by e-cigarettes/vaporizers (30%), little cigars/cigarillos (25%), cigars (20%), and natural cigarettes (20%). Between 33 and 49% of youth, depending on product, were not thinking about quitting at all. Correlates of lower motivation to quit differed somewhat by product type, with the most consistent being race, more frequent use, lower perceived riskiness of the product, and using the product because of its good taste or smell. Results from this study identify a set of psychosocial and behavioral factors, some that are common across tobacco products and others that are product-specific, that may be particularly important to address in efforts to reduce tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness. Future regulations on the sale of flavored tobacco products may also serve to increase motivation to quit in this population. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,J.

Assessing and treating complex mental health needs among homeless youth in a shelter-based clinic,"Winiarski, D.A.; Rufa, A.K.; Bounds, D.T.; Glover, A.C.; Hill, K.A.; Karnik, N.S.","Background: Rates of homelessness have been increasing in recent years, thereby necessitating a more direct approach to treating this complex social problem. Homeless youth have disproportionately high rates of untreated mental health problems and are therefore particularly vulnerable to the effects of homelessness during the transition period from adolescence to adulthood. Methods: The study team developed a shelter-based clinic and collected clinical measures on youth who attended this clinic from October 2016 through June 2018. Results: Youth attended an average number of three sessions, but there was a significant drop in follow-up after the first (intake) appointment. Depression, anger, and adjustment disorder emerged as the most common presenting mental health concerns identified by clinicians in the intake appointment, and trauma was identified as a significant complaint for those youth who returned for a second session. Conclusion: Mental health care is needed in this population, but future studies should explore alternative approaches to retaining homeless youth in treatment and in designing targeted trauma-informed interventions. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,BMC Health Serv.

Transcending the Professional–Client Divide: Supporting Young People with Complex Support Needs Through Transitions,"Ellem, K.; Smith, L.; Baidawi, S.; McGhee, A.; Dowse, L.","Young people with complex support needs frequently experience multiple intersecting forms of disadvantage including experiences of violence, abuse and neglect, housing instability and homelessness, problematic substance use, exclusion from education, and contact with the criminal justice system. Many of these young people have mental health, cognitive disability and/or other health issues that also impact on their lives. These young people need to navigate multiple, diverse, and often difficult transitions between services, adding to the existing chaos in their lives. This article explores the experiences of young people with complex support needs in transition, specifically young people’s viewpoints and experiences of supports they receive from paid professionals. This qualitative study used body mapping research methods and in-depth interviews with 38 young people aged 16 to 26 years in three Australian states. Helpful and trusting paid relationships could serve as an anchor to young people during complex transitions and other highly turbulent life periods. These relationships were contingent on a deep and non-judgmental knowing of the young person, contributed constructive outcomes and stability in young people’s lives, and for some young people, had ‘life-saving’ effects. These findings present opportunities and challenges for policymakers and practitioners to balance the tensions between authentic relationship-based work with young people and risk-averse, economically-driven imperatives in contemporary youth service provision. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Child Adolesc.

Smartphone application plus brief motivational intervention reduces substance use and sexual risk behaviors among homeless young adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Thompson, R.G.; Aivadyan, C.; Stohl, M.; Aharonovich, E.; Hasin, D.S.","Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18-21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal-Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p =.023), times used marijuana (p =.046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p =.012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p =.019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps >.05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p =.01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p =.032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results. © 2020 American Psychological Association.",2020,,Psychol. Addict.

Co-use of tobacco and marijuana among young people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County,"Tucker, J.S.; Shadel, W.G.; Seelam, R.; Golinelli, D.; Siconolfi, D.","Introduction: Tobacco and marijuana co-use among young people in the U.S. is a public health concern that deserves greater attention. This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by examining the prevalence and correlates of tobacco and marijuana co-use among young people experiencing homelessness. Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 449 unaccompanied homeless youth (mean age = 22; 72% male) who had used any type of tobacco product in the past 30 days. Participants were recruited from 12 service sites and 13 street sites in Los Angeles County. Results: Over 90% of young homeless tobacco users reported past month marijuana and tobacco co-use: 65% reported any co-administration (mixing both substances in a cigarette, joint, blunt, bong, hookah, pipe or bowl) and 27% reported only using them separately. Analysis of covariance tests found that co-administrators reported greater quantity and frequency of tobacco cigarette use, more frequent marijuana use and, in some cases, poorer functioning and more severe homelessness compared to other tobacco users (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that co-administration was less likely among youth who were Black (vs. white) and who perceived it as being the same or more harmful than cigarette smoking, but more likely among youth who reported greater exposure to peers who engaged in co-administration (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Co-administration of tobacco and marijuana is prevalent among young tobacco users experiencing homelessness. Results add to a growing literature on the prevalence and potential risks of co-administration among young people that can inform policies aimed at regulating tobacco and marijuana products. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,207,,,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107809,,#1874,Tucker 2020,,
“Something that actually works”: Cannabis use among young people in the context of street entrenchment,"Paul, B.; Thulien, M.; Knight, R.; Milloy, M.J.; Howard, B.; Nelson, S.; Fast, D.","Background Cannabis is one of the most widely used substances among vulnerable young people (<26 years of age) experiencing street entrenchment. Although previous research has documented the role cannabis can play in harm reduction, substance use and mental health treatment and pain management, this research has predominantly been quantitative and focused on adult drug-using populations. Little qualitative work has examined how young people who use drugs understand, experience, and engage with cannabis in the context of street entrenchment and drug use trajectories that include the use of other substances such as alcohol, opioids and crystal methamphetamine (meth). Methods Semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between 2017 and 2019 with 56 young people recruited from a cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. We also conducted 13 interviews with 12 youth-focused care providers across the same time period. Interview data were triangulated by drawing on the findings of a program of anthropological research conducted by the senior author since 2008. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted. Results The vast majority of study participants engaged in daily, intensive cannabis use at the same time as they cycled on and off other substances that were perceived as much more harmful (primarily alcohol, fentanyl, heroin and meth). While most participants derived significant pleasure from the use of cannabis, no participants in our study described using cannabis for purely recreational purposes. A number of participants explicitly framed cannabis as a form of mental health and substance use treatment that was more effective and “healthier” than the long-term use of psychopharmaceuticals and medication-assisted substance use treatment (e.g., opioid agonist therapies). Cannabis use was also understood to ameliorate some of the harms of, or even facilitate transitions out of, periods of street-based homelessness. While the majority of our participants highlighted the positive effects of regular cannabis consumption, some described how intensive cannabis use could generate significant harms. Conclusion In the context of the recent legalization of non-medical cannabis use in Canada and amid ongoing overdose and housing crises, it is imperative that future policy and programming interventions and provider education and training be responsive to the ways in which vulnerable youth in our setting are actively using cannabis to navigate their everyday lives and healthcare needs. © 2020 Paul et al.

Mixed Methods Evaluation of Formal Mentoring: Journey UP for Aging out of Foster Care,"Bonella, B.; Beirwolf, K.; Coleman, L.; Sterger, C.; Pulli, K.; Anguiano, C.; Barton, K.","There are 415,000 children in foster care in the USA. Many of those children will turn 18 before being adopted, meaning they will “age-out” and essentially be on their own as adults. We wanted to see if formal mentoring programs improved outcomes for those aging out of foster care and the Journey Up Mentorship Program in Salt Lake City offered such a program. Forty-nine youth who had aged out of foster care with the help of mentors were surveyed and found they scored significantly higher in their ability to get jobs and were less at risk for addiction, homelessness, and incarceration compared to data from the National Youth in Transition for Utah. Fifteen additional youth were interviewed in focus groups to explore the results further. Qualitative data showed participants were not less at risk given their stories, and benefited from mentors’ consistency, positive role modeling, and lessons on being an adult. This is consistent with other studies on the topic of mentoring but should be expanded into more specified comparative studies and use larger sample sizes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Glob.

Smoking cessation methods among homeless youth in a Midwestern city,"Glasser, A.M.; Macisco, J.M.; Miller, L.M.; Garbsch, E.M.; Wermert, A.; Nemeth, J.M.","Introduction: Nearly three times as many homeless youth smoke cigarettes in the United States (US) compared to the general population of youth. Few studies have focused on how to help homeless youth quit smoking. As part of a series of studies to develop a smoking cessation intervention for homeless youth, this study aimed to describe methods used in past quit attempts by homeless youth. Methods: Recruited from a drop-in center in the Midwestern US, the analytic sample was comprised of 32 unaccompanied homeless youth aged 14–24 who smoked combustible tobacco at some point in the past week. In-person qualitative interviews were conducted to understand prior quit attempt experiences of homeless youth. Results: Twenty-two youth (69%) were willing to quit smoking in the next 30 days. Most previous quit attempts were unassisted (78%). Participants frequently reported engaging in distracting behaviors (e.g., video games) or thoughts (e.g., remaining positive). Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was another popular method (38%), but with mostly negative reactions. While less common, vaping and use of cannabis to substitute cigarettes was reported in a notable faction of youth (28%), primarily 18–24 years of age. Conclusions: Youth are primarily engaging in non-evidence-based strategies to quit smoking. Existing evidence-based treatments are often underutilized or not used according to instructions, and youth who do use evidence-based treatments do not find them useful. Future research should explore effective cessation treatment among homeless youth that can ideally be provided at shelters and drop-in centers. Implications: Existing evidence-based treatments are underutilized by homeless youth in this study. Most homeless youth are willing to quit in the next month and are interested in trying behavioral counseling and monitored use of NRT. Drop-in centers may be an effective location from which to develop and offer targeted smoking cessation interventions for homeless youth. © 2020 The Authors",2020,,Addict. Behav.

"Piloting an evidence-based intervention for HIV prevention among street youth in Eldoret, Kenya","Embleton, L.; Di Ruggiero, E.; Logie, C.H.; Ayuku, D.; Braitstein, P.","Objectives: This study presents findings from piloting an adapted evidence-based intervention, Stepping Stones and Creating Futures, to change street-connected young people’s HIV knowledge, condom-use self-efficacy, and sexual practices. Methods: Eighty street-connected young people participated in a pre- and post-test mixed methods design in Eldoret, Kenya. The primary outcome of interest was HIV knowledge. Secondary outcomes included condom-use self-efficacy and sexual practices. Multiple linear regression models for change scores with adjustment for socio-demographic variables were fitted. Qualitative and quantitative findings are presented together, where integration confirms, expands on, or uncovers discordant findings. Results: Participants had a significant increase in HIV knowledge from pre- to post-intervention. The median HIV knowledge score pre-intervention was 11 (IQR 8–13) and post-intervention 14 (IQR 12–16). Attendance was significantly associated with HIV knowledge change scores. Qualitatively participants reported increased HIV and condom-use knowledge and improved condom-use self-efficacy and health-seeking practices. Conclusions: Our findings support the potential for further testing with a rigorous study design to investigate how best to tailor the intervention, particularly by gender, and increase the overall effectiveness of the program. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,Int.

Specialized assertive community treatment intervention for homeless youth with first episode psychosis and substance use disorder: A 2-year follow-up study,"Doré-Gauthier, V.; Miron, J.-P.; Jutras-Aswad, D.; Ouellet-Plamondon, C.; Abdel-Baki, A.","Aim: No previous study has investigated interventions for homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and comorbid substance use disorder (HYPS). An intensive assertive community intervention team (IACIT) offering outreach interventions, housing support as well as integrated care for early psychosis and substance use disorder (SUD) was created in 2012 at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM). To explore the impact of the addition of an IACIT to an early intervention for psychosis service (EIS) on housing stability, functional and symptomatic outcomes and mental health service use. Methods: A two-year longitudinal study comparing the outcome of HYPS receiving combined EIS and IACIT since 2012, to a historical cohort of HYPS receiving EIS only between 2005 and 2011. Socio-demographic data, housing stability, functioning, illness severity, SUD severity, emergency room visits and hospitalizations were assessed at admission, at 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter. Results: HYPS receiving EIS + IACIT achieved housing stability more rapidly and spent less time hospitalized than HYPS getting EIS only (RR 2.38, P =.017). HYPS with cocaine misuse were less likely to attain housing stability (RR 0.25, P =.04). No between-group differences were found for psychiatric symptoms, functioning and SUD outcomes. Conclusion: The addition of IACIT-HYPS to EIS was associated with earlier housing stability and reduced total hospitalization days compared to EIS alone. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2020,,Early Intervent.

Longitudinal Associations Between Early-Mid Adolescent Risk and Protective Factors and Young Adult Homelessness in Australia and the United States,"Heerde, J.A.; Bailey, J.A.; Toumbourou, J.W.; Rowland, B.; Catalano, R.F.","Homelessness is associated with a range of negative health and behavioral outcomes, yet life-course pathways to homelessness from adolescence to early adulthood are not well-documented. This study asks to what extent do early-mid adolescent risk and protective factors predict young adult homelessness, and whether the predictive nature of these factors is similar in Victoria, Australia, and Washington State in the USA. As part of the International Youth Development Study, adolescents were recruited as state representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at average age 25. Higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by Washington State (5.24%), compared to Victorian young adults (3.25%). Although some cross-state differences in levels of adolescent demographic, individual, family, peer group, school, and community predictors were found, cross-state comparisons showed these factors were equally predictive of young adult homelessness in both states. In univariate analyses, most adolescent risk and protective factors were significant predictors. Unique multivariate adolescent predictors associated with young adult homelessness included school suspension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.76) and academic failure (AOR = 1.94). No significant unique protective effects were found. Prevention and intervention efforts that support adolescents’ academic engagement may help in addressing young adult homelessness. The similar cross-state profile of adolescent predictors suggests that programs seeking to support academic engagement may influence risk for homelessness into young adulthood in both states. The similarity in life-course pathways to homelessness suggests that the USA and Australia can profitably translate prevention and intervention efforts to reduce homelessness while continuing to identify modifiable predictors. © 2020, Society for Prevention Research.",2020,,Prev.

"Prevalence and factors associated with substance use among street children in Jimma town, Oromiya national regional state, Ethiopia: A community based cross-sectional study","Ayenew, M.; Kabeta, T.; Woldemichael, K.","Background: Street children constitute a marginalized population in most urban centers of the world. According to UN sources, there are up to 150 million street children in the world today. The estimated number of children who live on the streets in Ethiopia was 150,000, of which about 60,000 of them in Addis Ababa. However, aid agencies estimate that the problem may be far more serious, with nearly 600,000 street children country-wide and over 100,000 in Addis Ababa. World Health Organization estimates that globally, 25-90% of street children indulge in substance use. Even if substance use has become a common problem in Ethiopia, most of the studies done mainly focused among schools, college and university students. Research on street children and their substance use habits in Ethiopia was limited and specifically non in Jimma town. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and factors associated with substance use among street children in Jimma town of Ethiopia in 2019. Methods: Cross sectional study was undertaken from March 1-31, 2019. Complete enumeration of study subjects was done and all 312 children of the streets were included. Interviewer administered structured questionnaires was used to collect the data. Bivariable logistic regression was carried out to select candidate for multiple logistic regression analysis with p-value < 0.25 at 95% confidence. Multiple logistic regression was carried out with those candidate variables using backward method and the associations predictors to the response variable was declared with p value of < 0.05 at 95% confidence level. Result: Three hundred twelve street children were included in the study. The prevalence of substance use was 30.8% with 95% CI [25-36.2]. Age > 14 [AOR: 1.97 95%CI:1.00-3.889], attending grade 1-4th [AOR: 0.33 95%CI:0.151-0.737], attending 5th grade and above [AOR: 0.27 CI:0.093-0.756], child whose mother used substances [AOR: 7.78 95%CI:3.00-20.11], child did not know his maternal substance use status [AOR:5.1 95%CI: 2.19-11.81], child whose sibling use substance [AOR: 2.23 95%CI:1.254-5.63], best friend substance use [AOR: 11.01 95%CI:5.47-25.04] and staying 12-60 months on the street [AOR:3.00 95%CI:1.511-5.96] and staying > 5 years on the street [AOR:4.6 95%CI:1.06-19.7] were significantly associated with substance use. Conclusion and recommendation: The prevalence of substance use among street children in Jimma town was high. Mothers and siblings have crucial roles in determining substance use behavior of the children. Stakeholders who are working on the improvement in the life of children of the street should try to satisfy the need of the children by intervening at individual level, at family or community level and at levels beyond community to lessen the problem to some extent. Researchers should do similar researches in more detail on these vulnerable but neglected groups of children to fully understand about the problem so the findings will be used as inputs for concerned bodies. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,Subst.

Characterizing street-connected children and youths' social and health inequities in Kenya: A qualitative study,"Embleton, L.; Shah, P.; Gayapersad, A.; Kiptui, R.; Ayuku, D.; Braitstein, P.","Background: Street-connected children and youth (SCY) in Kenya disproportionately experience preventable morbidities and premature mortality. We theorize these health inequities are socially produced and result from systemic discrimination and a lack of human rights attainment. Therefore, we sought to identify and understand how SCY's social and health inequities in Kenya are produced, maintained, and shaped by structural and social determinants of health using the WHO conceptual framework on social determinants of health (SDH) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) General Comment no. 17. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted from May 2017 to September 2018 using multiple methods including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, archival review of newspaper articles, and analysis of a government policy document. We purposively sampled 100 participants including community leaders, government officials, vendors, police officers, general community residents, parents of SCY, and stakeholders in 5 counties across Kenya to participate in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We conducted a thematic analysis situated in the conceptual framework on SDH and the CRC. Results: Our findings indicate that SCY's social and health disparities arise as a result of structural and social determinants stemming from a socioeconomic and political environment that produces systemic discrimination, breaches human rights, and influences their unequal socioeconomic position in society. These social determinants influence SCY's intermediary determinants of health resulting in a lack of basic material needs, being precariously housed or homeless, engaging in substance use and misuse, and experiencing several psychosocial stressors, all of which shape health outcomes and equity for this population. Conclusions: SCY in Kenya experience social and health inequities that are avoidable and unjust. These social and health disparities arise as a result of structural and social determinants of health inequities stemming from the socioeconomic and political context in Kenya that produces systemic discrimination and influences SCYs' unequal socioeconomic position in society. Remedial action to reverse human rights contraventions and to advance health equity through action on SDH for SCY in Kenya is urgently needed. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,Int. J.

"The impact of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness on housing, mental health, substance use, and family cohesion: a systematic review","Wang, J.Z.; Mott, S.; Magwood, O.; Mathew, C.; Mclellan, A.; Kpade, V.; Gaba, P.; Kozloff, N.; Pottie, K.; Andermann, A.","Background: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach. Results: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity. Conclusions: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,,BMC Public Health,19,1,,,10.1186/s12889-019-7856-0,,#1913,Wang 2019,,
Reimagining homelessness assistance for children and families,"Duffield, B.","The homelessness response system in the United States is dominated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD’s definition of homelessness, program models, metrics, data, approaches, and goals have overshadowed those of other federal agencies. This policy brief argues that children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness have been poorly served by HUD’s dominance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It proposes that other federal agencies, specifically the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education, are better suited to provide comprehensive homeless assistance for children, youth, and families.

Comparing mental health disorders among sex trafficked children and three groups of youth at high-risk for trafficking: A dual retrospective cohort and scoping review,"Palines, P.A.; Rabbitt, A.L.; Pan, A.Y.; Nugent, M.L.; Ehrman, W.G.","Background: Individuals at high-risk for trafficking are often subject to preexisting complex trauma that only intensifies during the trafficking experience. This greatly increases their risk of mental illness, although the actual prevalence of mental health disorders in children who are sex trafficked remains unclear. Objective: To examine the prevalence of mental health diagnoses among a sample of youth identified as being sex trafficked, and to discuss these rates in relation to other high-risk groups reported in the literature. Participants and setting: 143 female and male child trafficking victims in Wisconsin. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed individual medical records, identifying mental health diagnoses and behaviors. The results were compared to summarized prevalence data for mental health disorders in sex trafficked, runaway children, juvenile offenders, and foster care children identified via a scoping review. Results: We observed significantly higher rates of ADHD (52.4%, p < 0.0001), bipolar disorder (26.6%, p < 0.0001), and PTSD (19.6%, p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001) in our sample of trafficked youth compared to all high-risk groups, as well as for depression (45.5%), anxiety (19.6%), conduct disorder (19.6%), ODD (25.9%), and psychosis (14.0%) relative to multiple groups individually. Conclusions: The complex trauma suffered by child survivors of sex trafficking can impart numerous effects with overlapping symptomatology of many mental health disorders. Survivors’ adaptive responses to complex trauma may lead to improper diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders at the expense of prompt access to trauma-focused therapies. Alternative diagnoses and treatments of this complex dysfunction are discussed. © 2019",2020,,Child Abuse Negl.,100,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104196,,#1919,Palines 2020,,
"Young, Black, successful, and homeless: examining the unique academic challenges of Black students who experienced homelessness","Edwards, E.J.","Youth homelessness is a growing crisis impacting urban high schools across the United States. Black youth, in particular, are disproportionately affected. While the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act is designed to provide educational access to students experiencing homelessness, the extent to which the policy supports Black students is unclear. This qualitative study uses structural racism as an analytic framework to examine the narratives of eight Black youth who successfully graduated high school while experiencing homelessness. Findings show that being Black and experiencing homelessness creates unique challenges for accessing resources under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Participants identified hostile racial climates at school as a common deterrent from disclosing their homeless status to adults at school, thereby restricting their access to federal support. The findings suggest the need for race-conscious language and interventions to be included in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.

Youth Growing up in Families Experiencing Parental Substance Use Disorders and Homelessness: A High-Risk Population,"Ijadi-Maghsoodi, R.; Quan, M.; Horton, J.; Ryan, G.W.; Kataoka, S.; Lester, P.; Milburn, N.G.; Gelberg, L.","Objectives: We sought to understand the stressors, the parent-child relationship and family processes, and experiences with services among families experiencing parental substance use disorders (SUDs) and homelessness. Methods: We conducted a total of 41 in-depth semistructured interviews with parents with a history of SUDs and homelessness (n = 16) and housing support staff (n = 25) from May 2017 until January 2018. Participants were recruited from transitional housing facilities across the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which served families experiencing homelessness and parental SUDs. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and themes coded with Dedoose. Results: We found a high burden of trauma and guilt among parents, and a fear of SUD disclosure. We found challenges with family processes important for SUD prevention, including communication, discussion of substance use, and family and youth goal setting. We also discovered unique stressors related to navigating housing and services within the community. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the need for a family-based SUD-preventive intervention for youth growing up in families with parental SUDs and experiencing homelessness, to address the heightened SUD risk. In addition, findings from our study can inform clinical and housing services for this important population. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.",2019,,J. Child Adolesc.

"Police Strain, Negative Emotions, Criminal Propensity, and Criminal Coping","Baron, S.W.","Utilizing a sample of homeless street youths, the paper draws on general strain theory to understand how police contact and perceived police injustice are related to two forms of criminal coping. It also examines if the relationship between the two police strain measures and criminal coping is mediated by anger and depression. Further, it explores if a composite criminal propensity moderator recently theorized in GST influences the relationships between police strains and coping. Findings show both forms of police strain have direct relationships with property crime, while only police contact has a direct relationship with violence. Further, both forms of police strain have an indirect relationship with violence through anger. Finally, criminal propensity moderates the relationship between both forms of police strain and violent offending but not property offending.

This embedded mixed-method quasi-experimental pilot study examined the initial outcomes of Wahine (woman) Talk, a comprehensive sexual health program delivered by an interdisciplinary team to female youth experiencing homelessness. Wahine Talk includes provision of and connection to basic needs resources, peer mentoring, group based sexual health education, and linkage to and provision of sexual health care. Process and outcome data were collected throughout and for six months after Wahine Talk from a diverse group of 14–22-year-old female youth (N = 51) experiencing homelessness. In-depth individual and focus group interview data were collected from providers and youth after Wahine Talk, and analyzed using Template Analysis. Over half (62.7%) of participants were linked to sexual health care during Wahine Talk and birth control usage tripled following the program. Depo-Provera and long acting reversible contraception (LARC) usage, in particular, increased during Wahine Talk (1–19% and 0–25.5%, respectively).

Food insecurity among formerly homeless youth in supportive housing: A social-ecological analysis of a structural intervention,"Brothers, S.; Lin, J.; Schonberg, J.; Drew, C.; Auerswald, C.","A growing body of research indicates that structural interventions to provide permanent supportive housing (PSH) to homeless adults within a Housing First approach can improve their health. However, research is lacking regarding the impact of PSH on youth experiencing homelessness. This article seeks to understand how PSH for youth impacts a basic health need—food security— across multiple levels of the social-ecological environment. In January of 2014, San Francisco, California opened the city's first municipally-funded PSH building exclusively designated for transition-aged youth (ages 18–24). We conducted 20 months of participant observation and in-depth interviews with 39 youth from April 2014 to December 2015. Ethnographic fieldnotes and interview transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory. We present our social-ecological assessment regarding food insecurity for formerly homeless youth in supportive housing. We found that although housing removes some major sources of food insecurity from their lives, it adds others. Many of the participating youth were frequently hungry and went without food for entire days. Mechanisms across multiple levels of the social-ecological model contribute to food insecurity. Mechanisms on the structural level include stigma, neighborhood food resources, and monthly hunger cycles. Mechanisms on the institutional level include the transition into housing and housing policies regarding kitchen use and food storage. Interpersonal level mechanisms include food sharing within social networks. Individual level mechanisms include limited cooking skills, equipment, and coping strategies to manage hunger. Although supportive housing provides shelter to youth, effective implementation of the Housing First/PSH model for youth must ensure their access to an affordable nutritious diet. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Soc.

WOUND MEANING AND ITS CARE TO HOMELESS YOUTH AND CHLDREN,"Monsalve, T.M.A.; Pineda, Á.G.; Pulido, C.F.","Introduction: Homeless youth and children are those under 18 years old, that left their home and streets become their home. Streets expose themselves to many risks, leave them some wounds and physical injuries. Objective: Understand the wound meaning to homeless youth and children and how they treat them. Methodology: Qualitative, ethnographic research. 30 interviews were carried out, and a social cartography with youth and children was performed. Information was encoded and grade, conceptual maps were made. Results: Wounds were divided into mild and severe. Severity was related with the chance to die and whose need health care. Mild wounds are those which do not harm internal organs, are treat successfully with cultural treatment. Avoid hospital care because they are stigmatized and infected.

"Peer Support in the Homeless Youth Context: Requirements, Design, and Outcomes","Kidd, S.A.; Vitopoulos, N.; Frederick, T.; Daley, M.; Peters, K.; Clarc, K.; Cohen, S.; Gutierrez, R.; Leon, S.; McKenzie, K.","Peer support has a lengthy history in health and community services with particular prominence in areas such as addictions and mental health services. This growth in emphasis and evidence has not been mirrored in the area of youth peer support broadly nor peer support among homeless youth specifically. This situation has persisted despite the growing emphasis on youth lived experience engagement—including peer support. This paucity of literature framed the rationale for the present paper that provides a description of the structure, processes, and preliminary outcomes of an intentional peer support program delivered in the context of tertiary prevention of youth homelessness in a large Canadian urban setting. Pre-post findings for a cohort of 28 youth are reported in key mental health and community engagement domains and qualitative data from interviews with participants, peer supports, and staff are presented. These findings suggest that peer support would seem to be both a feasible and potentially impactful part of the repertoire of interventions from service to policy levels that are needed to address the complex and persistent global problem of youth homelessness. While promising, our work also suggests that peer support cannot be an afterthought-type element of programming but must be robust in process and structure to facilitate improvement for service recipients, the wellness of the peers, and the benefits for the team as a whole that results from effective peer engagement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,Child Adolesc.

Challenges of Parents of Youth with Antisocial Personality Disorder: A Qualitative Content Analysis,"Kiani, D.; Ziaeirad, M.","Introduction: A patient with antisocial personality disorder can impoverish the energy of the family and might cause the occurrence or aggravation of psychosomatic disorders in the family members especially parents. Therefore, determining the challenges for this group of parents can create a context for appropriate planning to meet their needs. The present study aimed to explore the challenges faced by parents of youth with antisocial personality disorder. Methods: This study employed a qualitative research design with a content analysis approach. The participants were 12 parents of youth with antisocial personality disorder from Shahrekord who were selected using purposive sampling. The data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The collected data were first recorded and then analyzed using conventional content analysis method. Results: The results of the present study revealed 5 themes and 10 categories including social isolation (parental rejection and social discredit), inadequate control and management (the parents’ inability to control the situation and the patient’s behaviors), homelessness (family’s frustration and indifference to those around the patient), constant distress (parental concerns and support), and helplessness (unsuccessful effort to control and treat the patient and mother’s mental and psychological suffering). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, parents of youth with antisocial personality disorder face many challenges to deal with the patients and control the conditions that require the attention of health care providers, including psychiatric nurses. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,J.

Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Youth in the United States: A Qualitative Systematic Review,"Hampton, M.D.; Lieggi, M.","Background: Homeless, runaway, and transgender youth are at high risk for commercial sexual exploitation in the United States. Research examining this phenomenon is growing but requires synthesis to facilitate its use by professionals who serve this population. The purpose of this review was to aggregate the qualitative evidence regarding commercially sexually exploited youth (CSEY) in the United States. Methods: The search included published and unpublished qualitative studies with current or former CSEY who reside in the United States. Results: There were 19 studies included in the review with a total of 795 participants. Eight themes were identified and grouped into three broader categories: experiences that preceded sex work entry, experiences that facilitated sex work continuation, and experiences that facilitated sex work exit. Conclusions: Understanding the barriers and facilitators of commercial sexual exploitation can inform the development of interventions that address the needs of CSEY and youth at risk for exploitation. The results of this review highlight the social and economic influences as well as the role of positive and negative reinforcements involved in sex work entry, its continuation, and exit.

Roll-your-own cigarette smoking among youth experiencing homelessness,"Tucker, J.S.; Shadel, W.G.; Seelam, R.; Golinelli, D.; Siconolfi, D.","Introduction: Roll-your-own (RYO) cigarette smoking is uncommon among young smokers in the U.S. but may be more widespread among those experiencing homelessness as it is a less expensive source of cigarettes. This study examines the prevalence and correlates of RYO use among young cigarette smokers experiencing homelessness. Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 433 unaccompanied homeless youth who reported past month use of factory-manufactured cigarettes. Participants were sampled from 25 street and service sites in Los Angeles County, and completed a survey on their tobacco-related behaviors and cognitions. Results: RYO use was reported by 43% of cigarette smokers. Among those who filled RYOs with tobacco, 87% rolled them with used tobacco (typically mixed with new tobacco). Most RYO smokers reported engaging in high-risk smoking practices, such as smoking discarded cigarettes. Although RYO smokers were more likely than other smokers to perceive RYOs as less risky in general, these groups did not differ in the perceived relative harm, expense, and ease of access of RYOs compared to regular cigarettes. Multivariable analyses indicated that RYO use was associated with older age, less perceived riskiness of RYOs, greater exposure to RYO smokers, and stronger future intentions to smoke. Conclusion: RYOs may encourage continued tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness and pose additional health risks despite users’ beliefs to the contrary. Future research is needed to obtain more detailed information on RYO practices and motivations for use, as well as how to address RYOs in efforts to reduce tobacco use in this population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,205,,,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107632,,#1946,Tucker 2019,,
A Promising Route Towards Improvement of Homeless Young People’s Access to Mental Health Services: The Creation and Evolution of an Outreach Service Network in Montréal,"Morisseau-Guillot, R.; Aubin, D.; Deschênes, J.-M.; Gioia, M.; Malla, A.; Bauco, P.; Dupont, M.-È.; Abdel-Baki, A.","Youth homelessness is a complex phenomenon as well as an important public health issue often compounded by mental illness of varying severity, in turn creating numerous deleterious consequences. While emergency health services usage remains high, access to mental health services is arduous and conventional interventions often fall short on providing integrated care and seldom lead to sustained positive outcomes for this group. From this observation, clinicians in Montreal, Canada, initiated collaborative meetings, eventually attended by a growing number of institutional and community stakeholders working with homeless youth. Acknowledging the unique needs of this population, the Réseau d’intervention de proximité auprès des Jeunes de la Rue (RIPAJ) or Montreal Homeless Youth Network was created to engage and seamlessly connect youth with the right resources within the network including mental health services amongst others. The genesis, philosophy and unique features of RIPAJ that allow for effective and cohesive interventions as well as future directions are discussed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Community Ment.

"Evaluating the effects of a rent subsidy and mentoring intervention for youth transitioning out of homelessness: protocol for a mixed methods, community-based pilot randomized controlled trial","Thulien, N.S.; Kozloff, N.; McCay, E.; Nisenbaum, R.; Wang, A.; Hwang, S.W.","Background: Although the risk factors associated with young people entering and becoming entrenched in street life have been thoroughly investigated, peer-reviewed evidence is scarce to nonexistent for rigorous interventions targeting social integration outcomes for young people who have experienced homelessness. From the limited research that has been done, emerging evidence signals that, although structural supports such as subsidized housing and social service providers are important, these resources alone are insufficient to help young people integrate into the mainstream society. Objective: The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influence social integration outcomes for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing in 3 Canadian cities. The primary outcome measures for this study are community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include social connectedness, hope, and academic and vocational participation at 18 months. Exploratory outcomes include income, perceived housing quality, engulfment, psychiatric symptoms, and participant perspectives of intervention barriers and facilitators. Methods: This is a convergent mixed methods, open-label, 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. The intervention will provide 24 young people (aged 16-26 years), who have transitioned out of homelessness and into market rent housing within the past year, with rent subsidies for 24 months. Half of the young people will also be randomly assigned an adult mentor who has been recruited and screened by 1 of our 3 community partners. Data collection will occur every 6 months, and participants will be followed for 30 months.Results: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Providence, St Joseph's, and St Michael's Healthcare Research Ethics Board (number 18-251). Enrollment took place from April 2019 to September 2019. Preliminary analysis of the baseline quantitative and qualitative data is underway. Conclusions: This pilot RCT will be the first to test the impact of economic and social support on meaningful social integration for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing. We believe that the mixed methods design will illuminate important contextual factors that must be considered if the intervention is to be scaled up and replicated elsewhere. Importantly, the CBPAR framework will incorporate the perspectives of the community, including formerly homeless young people, who are in the best position to determine what might work best in the context of their lives. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Contemporary American Transience: Nomadism and the Rationale for Travel among Homeless Youth and Young Adults,"Stablein, T.; Schad, L.A.","Researchers of street life and homelessness in the United States continue to acknowledge the persistence of nomadism among the young and homeless, yet we know little about the role that travel plays in their lives or the meanings and motivations tied to this contemporary experience. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we compare homeless youth and young adults that travel with those that do not. Building on theories of social networks, social capital, stigma, and identity we explore demographic, behavioral, and philosophical similarities and differences between the two groups to understand the rationale for travel. For the young and homeless today, travel adds to the reserve of strategies to build and maintain network affiliations, acquire resources, and manage stigma and identity as they relate to the hobo and transient traditions of the past. However, when compared to their non-traveling homeless counterparts, travelers face new challenges that offset the purported benefits derived from being mobile. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,Qual.

"Flâneur, Popular Culture and Urban Modernity: An Intellectual History of New Order Jakarta","Karsono, S.","Using as a prism the symbiosis between flânerie and the consumption and production of popular culture, this article reconstructs the intellectual history of Jakarta’s encounter with economic modernisation under Indonesia’s New Order (1966–98). By analysing the life of novelist Teguh Esha (b. 1947) and his Ali Topan trilogy, the article highlights the popularly held ideas that mirrored and modulated Jakarta’s experience of New Order modernisation. These ideas suggest that, as a way of life and a system of government, the New Order failed to produce a modernity where people could feel at home. What it summoned into being in Jakarta was a modernity with “flies in the ointment”, such as social alienation, an overpowering sense of homelessness, unbridled corruption, general moral collapse and prostitution in various professions. Rejecting the New Order’s pragmatic modernism, a section of the city’s urban youth put together and practised ideological modernism, which manifested itself in Islamic revival, Muslim pop and heterodox Islam. © 2020, © 2020 Asian Studies Association of Australia.",2020,,Asian Stud.

"The Links Between Sexual Abuse Severity, Running Away, and Parental Connectedness Among Youth at a Hospital-Based Child Advocacy Center","Saewyc, E.M.; Gewirtz O'Brien, J.R.; Miller, K.K.; Edinburgh, L.D.","Purpose: Runaway adolescents often have strained relationships with their parents. Given parental support is an important protective resource for traumatized young people, understanding differences in support within parent–adolescent relationships could aid in designing more effective interventions. We hypothesized (1) runaway adolescents seen at a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) would have poorer parental relationships than adolescents without a history of running away and (2) severity of diagnosed sexual violence would be associated with lower parental connectedness. Methods: Data were from 2,042 adolescents aged 10–19 years and their parents evaluated for any reason at our hospital-based CAC from 2008 to 2017. Parent–adolescent relationship scales were completed by adolescents and at least one parent/guardian (usually mothers). Sexual abuse was stratified at four levels, higher levels indicating increasingly severe forms of abuse. T-tests and analyses of variance to tested relationships between supportive and controlling parental behaviors by runaway status, and, among runaways, by the severity of sexual abuse. Results: Runaway adolescents comprised 58.3% of adolescents seen at the CAC; runaways reported lower parental support and higher parental controlling than patients without a history of running away. Those with the most severe forms of sexual abuse (including sexual exploitation and gang rape) reported the least supportive and most controlling relationships with parents, as did their parents. Conclusions: Findings support our clinical observations that polyvictimization of adolescents who have spent significant time as runaways may further strain parent–adolescent relationships. Future clinical research should focus on developing interventions to promote parental connectedness after a runaway episode. © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2019,,J. Adolesc.

Child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal: A scoping review,"Chaulagain, A.; Kunwar, A.; Watts, S.; Guerrero, A.P.S.; Skokauskas, N.","Introduction: Globally, 10-20% of children and adolescents suffer from mental disorders, with half of all them starting by the age of 14 and three-quarters before the age of 25. In Nepal, 40% of the population is younger than 18 years of age, and as such there is a large proportion of the population that is at risk of developing a mental disorder. There has been a recent recognition of child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal, although prior to this it had remained almost invisible on the health agenda. In response to growing concern, there is a need to conduct a review on children and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal. Objective: To review the existing studies on child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal. Methodology: A scoping review approach was used to identify studies on child and adolescent mental problems in Nepal. A search of Medline and PubMed databases for articles published from the database inception to August 2018 was conducted. Results: Ten papers were identified, and they all together included 7876 participants. Two studies reported on Post traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) and described a prevalence of 10.7% to 51% of earthquake-affected children and adolescents in the Kathmandu district of Nepal. Another study reported that 53.2% of former child soldiers met the cut-off score for PTSS. Two school surveys found that the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in school children ranged between 12.9 and 17.03%, whereas a study on emotional and behavioural disorders in homeless children reported a prevalence of 28.6%. The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was estimated to be as high as three in every 1000 persons in Nepal by one study. The clinical prevalence of anxiety disorders was reported ranging from 18.8% to 24.4% while that of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was 10-11.7% in various clinical samples of children and adolescents. Conclusion: Only a few studies on the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health in Nepal have been conducted. Clearly, there is a need for better study design and larger studies to understand more fully the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health disorders in Nepal, in order to adequately plan public health services accordingly. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,,Int.

Feasibility of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention with Sheltered Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Santa Maria, D.; Cuccaro, P.; Bender, K.; Cron, S.; Fine, M.; Sibinga, E.","Objectives: Evidence of the acceptability and potential efficacy of mindfulness strategies with at-risk youth is mounting. Yet only a few studies have assessed these strategies among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Methods: We conducted a mixed methods feasibility study of an adapted mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) with sheltered YEH. The MBI consisted of five 1.5-h sessions delivered at a youth homeless shelter over 2.5 weeks. A one-group pre/post-test design was utilized to collect quantitative assessments of real-time cognitions followed by qualitative inquiry to assess participants’ experiences and perceptions of the intervention. Results: Participants (N = 39) were between 18–21 years old with the majority identifying as male (56.4%), heterosexual (74.4%), Black (51.3%) and Hispanic (15.4%). Attendance was challenging for participants (2.2 sessions attended on average) who had varying work and school obligations. However, pre–post session survey data completeness was excellent (92% completion rate). Participants completed self-report surveys prior to and after each session that measured affect. Significant improvement in pre–post session outcomes were found for frustration, restlessness, stress, depression, boredom, and mindlessness. Participants reported high levels of acceptability of the curriculum content and delivery format. However, several substantial adaptations that youth identified may improve feasibility and acceptability among YEH. The results are limited by the small sample size and the use of a curriculum not developed with or for YEH. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential feasibility of using MBIs among YEH although adaptations to existing curricula are necessary to increase relevance, acceptability of, and access to MBIs among YEH. © 2019, The Author(s).",2020,,J.

Patterns of alternative tobacco product use among youth experiencing homelessness,"Golinelli, D.; Siconolfi, D.; Shadel, W.G.; Seelam, R.; Tucker, J.S.","Introduction: Identifying distinct patterns of tobacco product use can inform efforts to reduce poly-tobacco use among young people, but little is known regarding patterns of use among youth experiencing homelessness. This study identified patterns of using tobacco/nicotine products among youth experiencing homelessness, and assessed whether certain subgroups of youth were more likely than others to engage in specific patterns of use. Methods: Data were collected from a probability sample of 469 homeless youth who used tobacco in the past month, recruited from 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Participants reported on lifetime and past month use of natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos, electronic nicotine delivery systems, hookah, and chewing tobacco. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of tobacco product use. Results: We identified four main classes of use: traditional cigarettes smokers (34.7% of the sample), poly-tobacco experimenters (24.9%), current users of combustible products (natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos; 27.1%), and current poly-tobacco users (13.1%). Youth who were male, slept outdoors, and screened positive for substance abuse disorder were more than twice as likely as their counterparts to be current poly-tobacco users relative to traditional cigarettes smokers. Conclusions: Rates of poly-tobacco experimentation and current use among youth experiencing homelessness are high. This suggests that efforts to reduce the use of tobacco products in this population should focus on the combined use of these products, and further, that users with the greatest poly-use may have competing unmet needs such as substance use disorders and more severe homelessness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Addict.

Millennial consumers' responses to cause-related marketing in support of LGBTQ homeless youth,"Hensley, C.; Diddi, S.; Hyllegard, K.","This study explored Millennial consumers' responses to a cause-related marketing (CRM) initiative for a sensitive social cause-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) homeless youth. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed to examine the effectiveness of CRM in generating financial support for LGBTQ homeless youth. Findings revealed that self-cause congruence may be an important factor in determining Millennial consumers' responses to a CRM initiative for LGBTQ homeless youth; whereas, message frame/appeal may be less important for generating response to such an initiative. Findings also indicated that gender, information processing, guilt, and skepticism influenced Millennial consumers' attitudes toward brand, attitudes toward cause, and behavioral intentions toward the CRM initiative. These findings offer implications for brands/companies that may wish to engage in CRM initiative in support of sensitive social causes. By addressing a sensitive social cause-LGBTQ homeless youth-findings provide an original contribution to theCRMliterature. Findings reveal that self-cause congruence is an important predictor of behavioral intention toward the LGBTQ social cause. This provides an implication for marketers who want to target their relationship-building efforts toward individuals who have demonstrated prior engagement with a social cause. Findings also have implications for brands/companies that wish to develop CRM initiatives for controversial causes. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,,Soc.

Before Saying “I Do”: Legal and Policy Considerations for Facilitating Clarity on Human Trafficking and the Protection of Children in Albania,"Heywood, L.-M.","Data available on victims of human trafficking in Albania does not appear to point to a significant problem of human trafficking in the country. For example, from the years 2016 to 2018, 61 persons were officially determined to be victims of human trafficking, in a context where the average population for that period was 2,871,978 persons. However, beneath this representation of an ostensible average level of trafficking in Albania are signs which seem to be suggestive of a more serious problem in the country. Reports, for example, indicate that authorities have sometimes associated trafficking with a transnational element, while challenges have continued to be posed to the identification of those involved in forced begging, particularly unaccompanied children, street children, and children crossing borders. In addition to highlighting and assessing evident challenges that exist in the identification of real and potential victims of trafficking and the gaps that exist in the protection of children and vulnerable groups in law and in practice, this report provides clarity on the meaning of human trafficking and what could be done to provide a clearer picture of victims of trafficking in Albania. As Albania is being considered for accession negotiations in respect of entry into the European Union, the time is opportune to address challenges and gaps to the prevention and response to trafficking particularly given the European Commission's concerns on human trafficking and child trafficking in Albania. © Copyright 2020 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.",2020,,Violence Victims,35,3,285-306,,10.1891/VV-D-19-00067,,#1979,Heywood 2020,,
"Children at Work, Child Labor and Modern Slavery in India: An Overview","Srivastava, R.N.","There is a large child work force in India reported to be about 40 million. Child labor is being regarded as a form of modern slavery, as children are forced to work or have no choice to refuse work. Children are employed in a variety of occupations, many of which are hazardous. Exposure to machinery, pesticides, dust in agricultural work and fumes, chemicals, acids, cotton and wool fiber in other forms of work is detrimental to health. A large number are held in bonded servitude. In urban areas, children are employed as domestic helpers and engaged in eateries and auto-repair work. Trafficking and trading of children for work and sexual slavery are also major concerns. Poverty and illiteracy are root causes of child labor, but iniquitous societal attitudes are responsible for abuse and exploitation. Working children are deprived of proper health care and education, and lose their childhood and dignity. Several legal measures exist to prevent child labor and protect them from harm, but are thwarted by the distressing socioeconomic conditions. Although child labor would be difficult to abolish, exploitation can be prevented with concerted efforts of the government agencies, professional bodies and the civil society. © 2019, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.",2019,,Indian Pediatr.,56,8,633-638,,10.1007/s13312-019-1584-5,,#1980,Srivastava 2019,,
Identification with drug use among young adults who are at risk of transitioning to more serious use,"Horwitz, R.; Brener, L.; Meissner, F.; Rothermund, K.; von Hippel, W.; von Hippel, C.","Understanding the drug use trajectories for at risk young adults can help reduce harms associated with serious drug use. This longitudinal study tracked young people to assess whether implicit and explicit identification with substance use predicts changes in use over time and whether patterns of use impacts identification with drugs. Two hundred and twenty-eight participants were initially recruited from homeless shelters, youth centers, drug health services, and parks where young people who use drugs are known to frequent. Over a 20-month period, 78 of these original participants were successfully recontacted and surveyed again. The survey assessed implicit and explicit identification with drug use, along with known risk factors, to determine if identification predicts changes in drug use over time as assessed by frequency, recency, and multiple drug use. Results revealed that implicit and explicit identification with drug use were stronger among participants who used more frequently, more recently, and used multiple drugs, although this finding only emerged cross-sectionally and not longitudinally. Overall, these results suggest that patterns of drug use are associated with the identity of the individual and that identification with drug use is a marker of drug-using behavior, but identification with drug use does not appear to be predictive of future behavior nor an outcome of prior drug use. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Addict.

Population Size Estimates of Street Children in Iran: Synthesis of Multiple Methods,"Vameghi, M.; Roshanfekr, P.; Ali, D.; Noroozi, M.; Madani, S.; McFarland, W.; Mirzazadeh, A.","We used four methods (direct count, indirect count, wisdom of the crowd, and unique object multiplier) to map and estimate the population size of street children in six major cities in Iran in 2017. In aggregate for the six cities, the number of street children was estimated at 5296 (interquartile range [IQR] 4122-7071) using the median of the four methods. This corresponds to a rate of 16.3 (IQR 12.5–24.5) per 10,000 children age 5–18 years old, or 3.2 (IQR 2.4–5.3) per 10,000 total population. The total number for street children in the country is estimated at 26,000 (IQR 20,239–34,719) children.

The rescue of the (personality) through community - exemplary concepts of Catholic (self-)education between (freedom and commitment) in the Weimar Republic,"Maier, A.","The «question of the Subject» was a characteristic feature of late modernism, which reached its peak in Germany during the Weimar years. The problem arose from the fact that, on the one hand, the «Subject» was seen as the centre of its world; at the same time, it was put to the question. According to the way in which the issue was broached by an omnipresent cultural criticism, man was alienated from his essential being by the modernized and «disenchanted» world. The key players in the cultural-critical discourse promised to cure the situation of «transcendental homelessness» (Georg Lukàcs), which had appeared in the perception of many and had made formation of meaning as well as mastery of contingency more difficult, by invoking the idea of «community». The «problem of the Subject» was understood also as an educational challenge. Catholicism also participated in the debate on the «Subject» or «personality». After decades of inferiority in Germany, Catholicism had emerged as a powerful and self-confident agent. Two examples - the Catholic youth movement Quickborn, and the reception of the idea of a working school in the Catholic religious community - are analysed regarding the attempts that were made in the Catholic field to save the concept of «personality» through community, and the price that had to be paid for this strategy. © 2020 Academic Press Fribourg.

Risk and protective factors contributing to homelessness among foster care youth: An analysis of the National Youth in Transition Database,"Kelly, P.","Homelessness is a pervasive problem among youth aging out of the foster care system. Many of these youth exit the system without any concrete plans for their future and wind up suffering bouts of homelessness. Although a growing body of literature has begun to look at the factors that contribute to homelessness among this population, less has been written about the factors that guard against homelessness. Furthermore, most of the studies have been confined to a particular geographic area. Using data from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), combined with the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System (AFCARS), the present study provides an analysis of the risk and protective factors contributing to homelessness among a nationwide sample of foster care youth at age 21, 29% of whom had experienced homelessness. The findings indicate that the strongest protective factors against homelessness were having a connection to an adult and remaining in foster care until age 21. Other protective factors included having at least a high school education, being currently enrolled in school, and having a full-time job. On the other hand, the strongest risk factors contributing to homelessness were having been incarcerated, as well as having been referred for substance abuse. Other significant risk factors were having a runaway history, having received public food assistance, and being emotionally disturbed. Given these findings, child welfare agencies should make greater efforts to ensure that youth have an adult in their life whom they can trust and turn to for help, as well as encourage youth to remain in care until they are better prepared for life on their own. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Daily social and affective lives of homeless youth: What is the role of teacher and peer social support?,"Griffin, A.M.; Sulkowski, M.L.; Bámaca-Colbert, M.Y.; Cleveland, H.H.","Youth spend a significant amount of time in school surrounded by and interacting with teachers and peers. For doubled-up homeless youth (i.e., youth who share housing with a series of friends and/or extended family members), in-school relationships may be important for their emotional functioning. The current study captured dynamic processes by which in-school teacher and peer social support (i.e., baseline assessments of prior support and daily early-day reports of school day support) influence homeless youth's daily emotional well-being, as assessed by positive and negative affect later in the day. Specifically, a baseline survey was used in combination with a 10-day twice-a-day diary design to examine the competing influences of prior (i.e., between-person) and daily (i.e., within-person) social support from teachers and peers during the school day. Baseline teacher support and early-day peer support were associated with higher later-day positive affect. In contrast, baseline peer support was associated with lower later-day negative affect. Baseline peer support moderated the association between early-day peer support and later-day positive affect, in that there was a significant effect of early-day peer support and later-day positive affect for youth who reported medium and high levels of baseline peer support. However, the later-day positive affect of youth who reported low baseline levels of social support did not appear to benefit from early-day peer support. Results suggest that the source of support (i.e., teacher and peer) differently influences daily affect and that receiving daily in-school support can promote daily positive affect while mitigating negative affect for doubled-up homeless youth. Overall, study findings suggest that providing peer and teacher social support is a promising prevention and intervention approach for fostering resilience among doubled-up homeless youth. © 2019 Society for the Study of School Psychology",2019,,J.

Network-based intervention strategies to reduce violence among homeless,"Srivastava, A.; Petering, R.; Barr, N.; Kannan, R.; Rice, E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Violence is a phenomenon that severely impacts homeless youth who are at an increased risk of experiencing it as a result of many contributing factors such as traumatic childhood experiences, involvement in delinquent activities, and exposure to perpetrators due to street tenure. Reducing violence in this population is necessary to ensure that the individuals can safely and successfully exit homelessness and lead a long productive life. Interventions to reduce violence in this population are difficult to implement due to the complex nature of violence. However, a peer-based intervention approach would likely be a worthy approach as previous research has shown that individuals who interact with more violent individuals are more likely to be violent, suggesting a contagious nature of violence. We propose uncertain voter model to represent the complex process of diffusion of violence over a social network that captures uncertainties in links and time over which the diffusion of violence takes place. Assuming this model, we define violence minimization problem where the task is to select a predefined number of individuals for intervention so that the expected number of violent individuals in the network is minimized over a given time frame. We also extend the problem to a probabilistic setting, where the success probability of converting an individual into nonviolent is a function of the number of “units” of intervention performed on them. We provide algorithms for finding the optimal intervention strategies for both scenarios. We demonstrate that our algorithms perform significantly better than interventions based on popular centrality measures in terms of reducing violence. Finally, we use our optimal algorithm for probabilistic intervention to recruit peers in a homeless youth shelter as a pilot study. Our surveys before and after the intervention show a significant reduction in violence. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,Soc. Netw.

Trialing the feasibility of a critical time intervention for youth transitioning out of homelessness,"Kidd, S.A.; Vitopoulos, N.; Frederick, T.; Leon, S.; Wang, W.; Mushquash, C.; McKenzie, K.","Little is known regarding the specific types of service models and collaborations that are necessary to support diverse populations of youth in transition out of homelessness. Transitional supports addressing the complex needs of this population are needed to stabilize the array of housing arrangements that youth access. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of one such critical time intervention, called the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multicomponent, multidisciplinary intervention that provides 6 months of mental health and peer support, along with transitional case management to youth who have transitioned into some form of stable housing out of homelessness. In this trial, 65 youth were randomized to receive HOP-C plus treatment as usual or transitional case management plus treatment as usual. Outcome assessments were completed by 30 treatment and 28 control participants. The findings suggest that this intervention is feasible with mental health, employment or education, and housing metrics favoring HOP-C with odds ratios ranging from 2.28 to 3.18 and better subjective housing stability. Other indicators showed less change. HOP-C appears feasible and should be tested in a fully powered trial, providing the intervention for a duration longer than 6 months. Overall, these data suggest the potential benefit in fostering city-level, multidisciplinary teams sourced from several organizations to support youth transitioning out of homelessness.

Automated mobile phone-based mental health resource for homeless youth: Pilot study assessing feasibility and acceptability,"Glover, A.C.; Schueller, S.M.; Winiarski, D.A.; Smith, D.L.; Karnik, N.S.; Zalta, A.K.","Background: Youth experiencing housing instability have higher rates of mental health problems than their housed peers. Few studies have evaluated technological resources for homeless youth to determine how to effectively engage and reach them. Objective: The primary aims of this pilot study were to establish the feasibility (as measured by phone retention rates) and acceptability (ie, participant ratings of resources) of delivering automated mental health resources via smartphone technology. Methods: Youth aged 16 to 25 years (N=100) were recruited through homeless shelter agencies in the Chicago metropolitan area. Eligible participants completed a baseline assessment and received a smartphone with a 3-month data plan. The phone was preloaded with several apps designed to promote mental health wellness and provide real-time resources. One app specifically designed for this study, Pocket Helper 2.0, sent participants daily surveys and tips via push notification. The tips focused on coping and motivation, and the surveys assessed mood. This app also included an automated self-help system with brief cognitive behavioral interventions (5-10 min) and access to several interactive mobile tools, including a crisis text line, a telephone hotline, a crowd-based emotional support tool, and an app providing up-to-date information on social service and mental health resources for homeless youth in Chicago. Participants completed assessments at 3 and 6 months. Results: Some individuals (23%, 23/100) experienced problems with the phones (eg, theft, loss, and technological issues) throughout the study. Participant retention at the midpoint was moderate, with 48% (48/100) of youth responding to the 3-month surveys. At 6 months, only 19% (19/100) of the total sample responded to the end point survey. Overall, 63% (30/48) to 68% (13/19) of respondents at both time points reported benefiting from the intervention; however, participant usage and satisfaction varied with the different features. At both time points, participants reported receiving the most benefit from the daily tips and daily surveys. Daily tips that were most preferred by participants involved motivational tips related to overcoming struggles and making progress in life. Aside from the tips and surveys, the most used features were the app providing up-to-date resources and the automated self-help system. Interactive features, including the telephone hotline and crowd-based emotional support tool, were the least used features and were rated as the least beneficial. Conclusions: Automated mental health interventions seem to be an acceptable way to engage homeless youth in mental health support. The participants preferred fully automated features and brief interventions over features requiring interaction with others or more engagement. Future research should explore ways to retain homeless youth in interventions and evaluate the clinical impact of automated technology-based interventions for improving mental health. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc..

Estimating the size of substance using street children in Delhi using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS),"Dhawan, A.; Mishra, A.K.; Ambekar, A.; Chatterjee, B.; Agrawal, A.; Bhargava, R.","Street children as a population sub-group exist in significant numbers in the developing world and have been reported to be vulnerable to adverse health and risk behaviours that include physical and sexual risk behaviour. However, the estimation of prevalence for various psychoactive substances among the street children in a representative sample has not been attempted in the developing country like India. This is challenging due to the absence of an appropriate sampling frame, the population living in isolation, hiding their identity and concealing their behaviour. Use of psychoactive substances in street children is riddled with these challenges. The present investigation describes the findings from size estimation study on a representative sample of street child (n = 766) in Delhi, by implementing the Respondent Driven Sampling Methodology (RDS). The weighted prevalence for three commonest substances was found as Tobacco (31.1 %), alcohol (13.5 %) and inhalants (11.3 %) used during the last one year with the estimated number as –Tobacco (21,770), Alcohol (9450) and Inhalants (5600). Almost one third of street children were using some substance. Also, a large majority of ever users were also using substances currently. The study demonstrates successfully the implementation of RDS for the estimation of the prevalence of psychoactive substances in a representative manner. A large majority of street children use psychoactive substances, and there is a need for more of such studies in other metropolitan cities so that local level interventions and planning can be done for treatment and prevention of psychoactive substances among the street children.

Pomeranus non cantat? Uwe Johnson and Pomerania: A topos of the lost (first) homeland or where i come from doesn t alredy exist,"Talarczyk, A.","Uwe Johnson was perceived before 1989 exclusively as a writer of the division of Germany. Born in Pomerania (Kamień Pomorski), he spent his childhood and early youth in Mecklenburg. After obtaining his university degree in German philology in the German Democratic Republic, he moved to West Berlin. In the same year he published his first novel Mutmaßungen öber Jakob (the Polish edition Domniemania w sprawie Jakuba appeared in 2008), which besides the reflection on the division of Germany in the context of the Cold War, dividing Europe into two political camps, extensively describes his holidays he spent until 10 years of age in Darzewice near Wolin. It was, looking through the prism of the author s whole biography, the most happy period in his life and therefore a point of reference for forming a worldview in a bipolar world of the ideological indoctrination. The characters of his novels written in prose, like Jakob Abs, the main character of the novel mentioned above, hail from Pomerania. The article provides an analysis of determinants of the author s regional identity from the perspective of self-reflection in which a central position occupies the category of small homeland as understood in the theory of concrete utopia (Ernst Bloch), as well that of spiritual affinity (Johann Wolfgang Goethe), and spiritual homelessness (Siegfried Kracauer). © 2020 Przeglad Zachodniopomorski.

Understanding Wait Times in Rapid Re-Housing Among Homeless Youth: A Competing Risk Survival Analysis,"Hsu, H.-T.; Rice, E.; Wilson, J.; Semborski, S.; Vayanos, P.; Morton, M.","Approximately 3.5 million youth experience homelessness in the United States. Assisting youth to exit homelessness as quickly as possible through various housing venues aims to prevent adverse health impacts that prolonged homeless experiences may have on youth. Rapid re-housing (RRH) is a recent, short-term, less costly housing option than permanent supportive housing that provides temporary housing supports and services to counter homelessness. Although previous literature indicates that youth are likely to achieve stable homelessness exits via RRH, the duration of wait times for youth and potential disparities in RRH waiting periods remain unclear. We used administrative data from 16 communities across the United States (N = 10,920) to gain a greater understanding about RRH wait times among homeless youth. In addition, we adopted a competing risk survival analysis to investigate potential disparities (i.e., race and ethnicity, gender, rurality, sexual orientation, and previous homelessness condition) in RRH wait times while taking into consideration the presence of other homelessness exit options (e.g., permanent supportive housing). Study results indicate that RRH is a common homelessness exit for homeless youth and is prioritized for youth assessed as mid-vulnerability, per commonly accepted assessment measures of youth vulnerability. However, youth who received RRH waited, on average, 131 days following their housing eligibility assessment. Furthermore, being a minor (i.e., 17 years old or younger), experiencing homelessness in rural communities, and lower engagement in homeless services (e.g., emergency shelters and transitional living programs) were all associated with lower probability of exiting into RRH over time, taking into account the possibility of other competing homelessness exits. Expansion of the short-term housing supports offered through RRH may be a promising strategy to counter homelessness among youth in a timely manner. However, such an expansion should also address the potential disparities underlying youths’ wait time to receive RRH in order to reduce prolonged homelessness experiences within this vulnerable population. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,J.

Coping amidst an assemblage of disadvantage: A qualitative metasynthesis of first-person accounts of managing severe mental illness while homeless,"Karadzhov, D.; Yuan, Y.; Bond, L.","What is known on the subject?: Understanding what strategies individuals use to cope with serious mental illness is vital for enhancing their quality of life, mental well-being and recovery, and effective use of services; An episode of homelessness can be a profoundly disruptive event that often leads to chronic stress, social isolation, a negative belief about oneself and restricted access to care, among other adverse experiences;. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: In contrast to existing reviews of qualitative research focusing on escaping homelessness, managing problem substance use and growing resilience, the current review offers an in-depth, interpretive account of coping with serious mental illness during an episode of homelessness; This paper integrates evidence showing the diverse and intricate processes via which homelessness can impede an individual's ability to successfully cope with life stressors and with chronic mental illness; Despite experiencing severe social disadvantage, many individuals demonstrate positive adaptation and coping, and even personal growth;. What are the implications for practice?: It is important to be aware of the many ways in which coping with serious mental illness can be influenced by adverse environmental factors such as poverty, homelessness, traumatic life experiences and institutional discrimination; Nursing practice should recognize that coping efforts by individuals facing multiple forms of social disadvantage may be shaped by acute adverse life events and institutional interactions, as well as by the stresses and strains of living on the streets; Nursing practice should focus not only on reducing clients' mental illness symptoms and facilitating positive coping behaviours, but also on helping create the conditions that aid clients in leveraging inner resources for personal growth and constructive meaning-making. Abstract Introduction An evidence gap persists concerning the impact of extreme socio-structural disadvantage, such as homelessness, on the nature and effectiveness of coping with severe mental illness (SMI). While existing reviews of qualitative research into homelessness have focused on processes such as escaping homelessness and managing concurrent problem substance use, as well as on the experiences of specific vulnerable groups such as women and youth, no analogical review has been dedicated to understanding the management of SMI during an episode of homelessness. Aim/Question A qualitative metasynthesis of first-person accounts was conducted to understand how individuals cope with SMI when experiencing homelessness. Method The systematic search strategy yielded 481 potentially eligible sources. Following the team-based full-text screening and the two-tiered quality appraisal, 14 studies involving 377 participants with lived experience were synthesized following Noblit and Hare's metaethnographic method. Results Seven third-order concepts were derived capturing the complex nature and processual character of coping, as well as the web of contextual influences upon coping strategies. The resultant line-of-argument synthesis reveals the dialectical relationship between the two higher-order constructs—“the continuum of coping” and “the assemblage of disadvantage.” Discussion Despite the profoundly adverse impacts of biographical and socio-structural conditions, many individuals mobilized internal and external resources to enable various coping processes. Coping in the context of multiple disadvantage is not a monolith but rather a multidimensional, contingent and fluid phenomenon. Implications for practice Nursing practice should espouse a humanizing, structurally competent, and strength- and meaning-oriented approach in order to meet the complex and multifaceted needs of such multiply disadvantaged persons. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020,,J.

Exploration of associations between family and peer risk and protective factors and exposure to physically violent behavior among homeless youth: A meta-analysis,"Heerde, J.A.; Hemphill, S.A.","Objective: Limited research has investigated the influence of risk and protective factors on homeless youths' health and social problems. This study presents a meta-analysis exploring associations between family and peer risk and protective factors and exposure to physically violent behavior in homeless youth. Method: A series of meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted. The selection of family and peer risk and protective factors examined was data-driven. Moderator analyses compared the influence of methodological-level (study quality and research design) and sample-level (age and gender) variables on associations between family and peer factors and homeless youths' exposure to physically violent behavior. Results: The meta-analyses yielded 194 effect sizes from 25 studies, analyzing data from 6,953 youth aged 12 to 21 years, from North America. Childhood abuse was significantly associated with exposure to physically violent behavior both as perpetrators (odds ratio = 4.34, 95% confidence interval [2.99, 6.30], p < .0001) and victims (odds ratio = 7.40, 95% confidence interval [3.72, 14.74], p < .0001). Similar associations were evident for associations between engagement with deviant peers and exposure to physically violent behavior. Few associations were evident for family and peer protective factors. Moderator analyses showed variation in results based on methodological-level (e.g., study design) and sample-level (e.g., gender) variables. Conclusion: Future research exploring risk and protective factors in their association with a range of outcomes is needed. Such research is imperative for informing prevention and early intervention strategies designed to improve homeless youths' behavioral outcomes and reduce their experience of homelessness. © 2019 American Psychological Association.",2019,,Psychol.

As part of an adolescent human immunodeficiency virus prevention study, we provided same-day Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) testing and treatment. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of same-day CT and NG treatment on the proportion of participants receiving timely treatment. Methods We recruited adolescents with high sexual risk behaviors aged 12 to 24 years from homeless shelters, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations, and community health centers in Los Angeles, California, and New Orleans, Louisiana from May 2017 to June 2019. Initially, participants were offered point-of-care pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral/vaginal CT and NG testing and referral to another clinic for treatment. After March 2018 in Los Angeles and November 2018 in New Orleans, we provided same-day treatment (and partner treatment packs) for study participants. We measured the proportion of participants who received same-day treatment and the median time to treatment. We collected frequency of partner treatment and any reported adverse treatment-related events. Results The proportion of participants receiving same-day CT and NG treatment increased from 3.6% (5/140) to 21.1% (20/95; Δ17.5%; 95% confidence interval, 9.2%-26.9%) after implementation of same-day testing and treatment. The median time to treatment decreased from 18.5 to 3 days. Overall, 36 participants took a total of 48 partner treatment packs. There were no reported treatment-related adverse events.

Assessing Assets Among Street-Connected Youth: New Angles With Participatory Methods in Tanzania,"Johnson, L.R.; Drescher, C.F.; Assenga, S.H.; Marsh, R.J.","Street-connected adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa have been neglected in scholarly research. Extant literature is largely problem focused. This study describes strengths and assets among street-connected youth in Tanzania, using a participatory, mixed methods approach. Adolescents (N = 38, 13-17 years) in a rehabilitation center for street youth in Northern Tanzania completed a Swahili version of the Developmental Assets Profile (DAP). They engaged in participatory activities designed to capture multiple perspectives and promote maximal engagement. A subsample of youth (n = 8) took part in photovoice to elucidate contextual details. Although exploratory, we expected (a) participants would have lower scores on the external versus internal domain of the DAP; (b) qualitative methods would support the DAP and provide complementary, contextual information; and (c) participatory methods would be important for providing varied perspectives and engaging youth in the research process. Results revealed a moderately high level of assets, with strengths in constructive use of time and commitment to school. External assets were higher than internal assets; however, different assets were emphasized across different methods. Overall, results supported the DAP framework. The participatory approaches effectively engaged youth and illuminated the culture and context of their development. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,,J. Adolesc.

"Association between water, sanitation, general hygiene and oral hygiene practices of street-involved young people in Southwest Nigeria","Folayan, M.O.; Obiyan, M.O.; Olaleye, A.O.","Background: Oral hygiene practices can be linked to personal hygiene practices, including access to water and other sanitation facilities. The objective of the study was to determine if there is an association between oral hygiene practices and water and sanitation hygiene (WASH) practices among street-involved young people (SIYP). Methods: A cross-sectional study recruited SIYP age 10-24 years in two States in Nigeria recruited through respondent-driven sampling in December 2018. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on water access, sanitation, personal and oral hygiene. The instruments used for collecting the data were standardized tools for measuring the phenomena studied. The association between knowledge and practice of oral hygiene; oral hygiene and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and indicators of good oral hygiene were determined using binary logistic regression guided by two models. Results: A total of 845 study participants were recruited. The proportion of SIYP with good knowledge of oral hygiene was low (31.2%), and fewer had good oral hygiene practice (8.9%). There were significant associations between knowledge and practice of tooth cleaning, use of fluoride-containing toothpaste, dental flossing, consumption of sugar between meals, and frequency of dental check-ups (p < 0.001 respectively). Respondents with good water collection and storage practices (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.24-3.24; P = 0.005) and those residing in Lagos (AOR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.61-5.06; P = 0.001) had a higher likelihood of having good oral hygiene.

Prevalence of ever testing for HIV was significantly higher among youth who reported risk factors for HIV (sexually active, transactional sex, or ever having an STI). Higher prevalence of testing within the last year was significantly associated with experiencing physical abuse or transactional sex. However, reporting > 4 sexual partners or not using condoms were not associated with higher testing.

HIV/AIDS prevention education: An effective tool for enhancing street children's knowledge and attitude. A randomized controlled trial,"Khezri, M.; Farokhzadian, J.; Nematollahi, M.; Foroughameri, G.; Sharifi, H.","Objective: Street children are vulnerable against HIV because of poverty, lack of family support, adult supervision, social exclusion, lack of access to health services and their special living environment. Required educational program could decrease the danger of transmission of HIV in this group. This study would investigate the effects of HIV prevention educational on street children's attitude and knowledge in the southeast of Iran. Methods: Totally, 60 street children were randomized into the intervention and control groups. Knowledge and attitude of the participants about HIV/AIDS were evaluated. Using two-day meeting, the intervention group received some information on the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment and wrong and right believes of HIV/AIDS. The control group received nothing about the topic. Children settled in a childcare center by the end of the survey and after 30 days the knowledge and attitude of both groups were evaluated again. Results: The result of the study presented significant increase in street children's attitude and knowledge of intervention group compared to control group and before intervention. Follow-up data collected 1 month later revealed that the children who received the HIV/AIDS intervention subsequently had greater HIV/AIDS knowledge and favorable attitude toward HIV/AIDS.

Exploring the 'spoiled’ and 'celebrated’ identities of young and homeless drug users,"Hoolachan, J.","Young people experiencing homelessness and who use drugs are vulnerable to being attributed with ‘spoiled identities’ due to stigmatising attitudes by wider society. This article is underpinned by a symbolic interactionist account of self-identity and stigma. It draws upon ethnographic research in a UK-based supported accommodation hostel for young people and explores how the residents in the hostel related to the labels of ‘homeless,’ ‘drug user’ and ‘youth’ and how these were expressed through their self-identities. Over a period of seven months, in-depth participant-observation, semi-structured interviews and a focus group were conducted involving 22 hostel residents, aged 16 to 21 years old. The data highlight how the residents engaged in processes of ‘distancing’ or ‘othering’ by making disparaging remarks about other people in similar situations based on stereotyping. These processes reinforced spoiled identities while enabling the residents to disassociate from them. However, residents also appeared to embrace and celebrate certain features of each label, indicating an acceptance of these more positive features as forming a part of their self-identities. The article concludes by arguing for a nuanced approach to understanding stigma and identity among homeless people, one that accounts for more than just a person’s housing situation. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",2020,,Soc.

Study design: The study used a cross-sectional, self-report survey design. Methods: Surveys were used to gather demographic, mental health, and quality of life data from a sample of 1103 Canadian youth accessing homeless services with data collected in 2015. This article focused on the 332 Indigenous respondents, using both comparisons with non-Indigenous youth and within-group comparisons across key domains. Results: These findings suggested greater mental health and addiction challenges among Indigenous homeless youth compared with non-Indigenous respondents as well as evidence of a more problematic role of child protection. Within-group comparisons suggested that female and sexual and gender minority youth are particularly at risk among Indigenous youth with some added child protection and justice implications for reserve-raised youth.

As children walk through, and talk about, their everyday places of play and mobility they sense and reveal material and relational diversity in the places and people they encounter. We examine temporal and affective changes in children’s experiences of familiar places when in the presence of strangers–older youth and homeless people. We draw on walking interview and/or focus group data gathered from children aged 9–12 years living in socio economically and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Declining rates of physical activity and independent mobility in children and calls for urban spaces that nurture children’s agency and wellbeing provide the research context. Ideas of enabling places are adapted to explore the way constructs of otherness, inclusion and difference can be fortified through social and material expressions of hyperdiversity in the urban landscape. We explore the contention that how children and adults behave, identify and feel within particular urban spaces arises from everyday encounters and affective relations with place itself.

Mental health of mothers and children of homeless families in Ile de France. Results of the ENFAMS survey,"Roze, M.; Vandentorren, S.; Melchior, M.","Introduction: The number of homeless families in the Greater Paris region has increased over time and given their vulnerability, it is necessary to better know their characteristics, especially in terms of mental health. Our objective was to study the prevalence of mental health difficulties among homeless women and their children and associated factors. Methods: This study was based on the ENFAMS survey, conducted during the winter of 2012–2013 among 801 homeless families in the Greater Paris region, by trained interviewers and psychologists. Mothers’ depression was assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and their Post Traumatique Stress Disorders was assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Depression and PTSD of the mothers were studied in weighted Poisson regression models with robust error variance. The emotional and behavioural difficulties of children were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and studied by linear regression. Results: Homeless women have a high prevalence of depression (28.8 %) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (18.9 %); their children have high levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties (20.8 %). Factors associated with maternal depression include fluency in French, suicidal risk, PTSD, and unmet medical needs. The risk of PTSD in mothers was associated with departure from the country of origin for a violent cause, depression and residential instability. Children's emotional and behavioral difficulties were associated with parents’ birth region, residential mobility, children's health and overweight, children's sleep patterns, mother's suicidal risk, the fact that children do not like their housing or are victim of school bullying. Conclusion: The standard health care system and primary care professionals must take advantage of the opportunity offered by each contact with homeless families to detect mental health disorders, which have a high prevalence in both mothers and their children, and refer them to existing structures to facilitate their access to health care. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",2019,,Neuropsychiatr.

Initiation into heroin use among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting: A longitudinal cohort study,"Goldman-Hasbun, J.; Kerr, T.; Nosova, E.; Shulha, H.; Wood, E.; DeBeck, K.","Background: Emerging evidence suggests that non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) use may be a risk factor for initiating heroin use; however, pathways from PO to heroin use among youth remain underexplored. We sought to examine the association between NMPO use and heroin initiation. Methods: Between September 2005 and June 2017 data were derived from an open prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14–28 who use illegal drugs in Vancouver, Canada. The study included 526 youth who had never used non-injection heroin, and 652 youth who had never used injection heroin at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to examine the association between NMPO use – in addition to other substance use patterns – and subsequent initiation into non-injection and injection heroin use. Results: Among those who had never used non-injection heroin at baseline, 133 (25.3%) initiated non-injection heroin use during the study period. Among those who had never injected heroin at baseline, 137 (21.0%) initiated heroin injection during the study period. In multivariable analyses, NMPO use, crack use, and crystal methamphetamine use predicted non-injection heroin initiation (all p < 0.05). In separate multivariable analyses, non-injection heroin and crystal methamphetamine predicted heroin injection initiation (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Among street-involved youth in this setting, NMPO use predicted initiation into non-injection heroin use but not initiation into heroin injection. Interestingly, crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamine use were stronger predictors of heroin initiation than NMPO use was, suggesting that stimulant use may carry greater risks for heroin initiation than NMPO use. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,205,,,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107579,,#2059,Goldman-Hasbun 2019,,
Surviving in the cracks: a qualitative study with indigenous youth on homelessness and applied community theatre,"Ansloos, J.P.; Wager, A.C.","Indigenous youth are disproportionately impacted by homelessness in Canada. Little is known about Indigenous youths’ lived experiences of homelessness and the dominant methodological orientation in related research uses quantitative research methods.

Prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections and associated factors among street children in Jimma town; South West Ethiopia in 2019: A cross sectional study,"Zenu, S.; Alemayehu, E.; Woldemichael, K.","Background: Street child is any child whose age is less than 18 years for whom the street has become his or her habitual abode and/or source of livelihood, is inadequately protected, supervised or directed by responsible adults. In Ethiopia the health problems of street children are given poor attention in research. This problem is pronounced when it comes to intestinal parasitic infections, making it difficult to design appropriate interventions targeting this segment of population. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections and associated factors among street children in Jimma town in the year 2019. Methods: Community based cross sectional study was employed. Complete enumeration was used to include 312 street children. Pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data was entered to Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20. Stool samples were examined by wet mount and formalin ether concentration techniques. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with intestinal parasitic infection. Significance of association was decided by using the 95% confidence interval of AOR and P-value of ≤0.05 in the multivariable model. Result: A total of 312 children of the street were involved in the study making the response rate 96.2%. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was 66.7%. Untrimmed finger nails AOR = 2.03;95%CI (1.02-4.06), eating street food AOR = 2.24;95% CI (1.04-5.02), practice of swimming in unprotected water bodies AOR = 2.5; 95% CI (1.24-5.04), not wearing shoes at the time of data collection AOR = 3.8;95% CI (1.8-8.2) and lacking knowledge of way of transmission of intestinal parasites AOR = 2.5; 95% CI (1.25-5.0) were significantly associated with parasitic infections. Conclusions: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among street children in the study area was high and require integrated interventions to avert the problem.

Dealing with the impact of separation in the context of a therapeutic intervention called Special Time,"Cavalli, A.; Williams, G.","This paper describes a therapeutic intervention called ‘Special Time’ which is meant to give the possibility to teachers, nurses and other related professions, to offer total attention for 45 min to a child or an adolescent. There are some elements in common with child psychotherapy such as the use of a box with toys and other play materials for the allocated ‘time’ and the worker uses observational skills, notes her own feelings and emotions and writes an account of what happened for discussion in a group or individually with a supervisor.

"Vaccination status and associated factors among street children 9–24 months old in Sidama Region, Ethiopia","Deressa, A.T.; Desta, M.S.; Belihu, T.M.","Background: Childhood non-vaccination can have different short-and long-term negative outcomes on their health. In Ethiopia, in addition to low coverage of full vaccination, street children were among the neglected part of the community who were missed during planning and reporting vaccination coverage. Moreover, there is no related research conducted on this title specifically. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the vaccination status and its associated factors among street children 9–24 months old in Sidama zone. Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in four selected towns of Sidama region, southern Ethiopia. The convenience sampling method was applied to involve mothers of street children younger than two years during the study period. Data entry was done with EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS22 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify factors associated with immunization status of street children. Results: A significant number (26 [24.3%]) of the street children younger than two years were not vaccinated. Those mothers who are ≤20 years old (P = 0.014, AOR = 0.216, 95% CI: 0.064–0.732) and who gave birth at home (P = 0.029, AOR = 0.292, 95% CI: 0.097–0.879) had less odds of vaccinating their child than those older than 20 and who gave birth at health facility respectively. Conclusion: A significant number of the street children in this study are not fully vaccinated. Mothers aged <20 years and home births were significantly associated with non-vaccination status. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,Ann. of Global Health,86,1,,,10.5334/aogh.2650,,#2069,Deressa 2020,,
"“Getting pregnant might make me seem more normal to them”: Attitudes, experiences, and gendered nuances regarding pregnancy and parenting among youths experiencing homelessness","Begun, S.; Torrie, M.; Combs, K.M.; Frey, C.","Homelessness among youths exacerbates an array of challenging life experiences, notable examples of which are pregnancy and parenting. Research is lacking on young men’s attitudes and experiences, and also the influences which homeless youths’ gender identities and sexualities may have on their pregnancy and parenting outcomes and trajectories. This study qualitatively explores gender differentials, including youths’ gender identities and sexual orientations, with regard to their attitudes and experiences of pregnancy and parenting while homeless. Qualitative data were obtained from interviews with a diverse sample of 30 female, male, and transgender homeless youths, ages 18 to 21. Findings revealed that topics of pregnancy and parenting represent a wide range of complexities, different standards, and threats for homeless youths. Although pregnancy is often viewed positively within this community, it is received and experienced differently for each gender and sexuality. Results demonstrate that youths’ unimpeded access to and knowledge of all available reproductive and sexual health care services is essential. These services must be designed and delivered for youths of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Interventions and resources on parenting and co-parenting, particularly models that more inclusively engage a greater diversity of young parents’ involvement, are also urgently needed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,J.

Health Risks and Outcomes of Homelessness in School-Age Children and Youth: A Scoping Review of the Literature,"Gultekin, L.E.; Brush, B.L.; Ginier, E.; Cordom, A.; Dowdell, E.B.","Despite reports that over 1.3 million school-age children (ages 5–18) were homeless in 2019, little is known about the effects of homelessness on their overall health and well-being. To better understand where gaps exist, a scoping review of the literature was conducted to identify studies of the physical, mental, and behavioral health risks and outcomes of school-age children experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Following the Joanna Briggs Institute framework and Preferred Reporting Items (PRISMA) guidelines, seven electronic databases were searched using key words: homelessness, children, health, and well-being. Of the 4,372 records, 23 articles met inclusion criteria. Most examined mental health and high-risk activities or behavioral risks related to school achievement. Few studies tracked the long-term health outcomes of homeless school-age children.

System involvement among young adults experiencing homelessness: Characteristics of four system-involved subgroups and relationship to risk outcomes,"Narendorf, S.C.; Brydon, D.M.; Santa Maria, D.; Bender, K.; Ferguson, K.M.; Hsu, H.-T.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Shelton, J.; Petering, R.","Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) have been found to have high rates of prior involvement with foster care and juvenile justice, but little is known about whether YAEH differ in their risk behaviors based on exposure to different systems. This study used a dataset of 1426 YAEH from 7 different US cities to examine the historical risk and resilience characteristics of those involved in foster care alone, juvenile justice alone, both systems (dual status), and no system involvement. Logistic regression was used to examine whether different types of childhood system involvement predicted risk behaviors in young adulthood including substance use, trade sex, suicide attempts, unplanned pregnancy, and involvement in the adult criminal justice system. Notably, 57% of youth had been exposed to one of the systems – 20% foster care only (n = 291), 18% juvenile justice only (n = 254), and 18% dual status (n = 261). YAEH without a history of system involvement had significantly lower childhood trauma scores and lower rates of lifetime mental health diagnoses compared to all three system involved groups, with dual status youth having the highest rates of both. In relation to risk outcomes, youth with dual status histories had higher odds of trading sex and those with juvenile justice involvement, either alone or as dual status, had higher odds of being arrested after age 18 and of problematic substance use. Results suggest YAEH with prior involvement in child-serving systems have unique risk characteristics that vary by type of system involvement, with dual-system involved youth at particularly high risk. Findings highlight the need for foster care and juvenile justice systems to work collaboratively in providing preventive interventions prior to system exit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Homelessness experiences and gender identity in a population-based sample of adolescents,"Eisenberg, M.E.; Kelly, E.D.; McRee, A.-L.; Brady, S.S.; Barnes, A.J.","This paper examines the prevalence of homelessness among transgender/gender diverse (TGD) youth in a population-based sample of adolescents. We used data from a statewide sample of 9th and 11th grade adolescents in Minnesota who responded to a school-based survey during 2016 (N = 80,929). Survey questions assessed adolescents' gender identity and experiences of homelessness (either with adult family members or unaccompanied) in the past 12 months. We used chi-square analyses to compare the prevalence of homelessness between gender identity groups. Overall, 2.7% of the sample reported identifying as TGD. Significantly more TGD (vs. cisgender) youth reported experiencing homelessness either with adult family members (6.7% vs. 3.5%) or unaccompanied (3.6% vs. 1.1%; p <.0001). Findings from this population-based survey suggest that TGD youth are more likely to experience homelessness, either with a family member or unaccompanied, than cisgender peers. Ensuring housing stability among this population is critical, given health risks associated with homelessness during adolescence. Data on homelessness experiences of TGD youth are needed to inform practice and policies for this distinct population. © 2019",2019,,Preventive Med.

Risk-taking behaviors of homeless youth: moderation by parental monitoring and social support,"Owens, C.R.; Codd, E.L.; Haskett, M.E.","Adolescence is a critical developmental period when youth are transitioning to be more independent while also being at heightened risk for negative developmental trajectories. This is especially true for adolescent youth experiencing homelessness. Using state population-representative 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data, we examined the association between youth homelessness and engagement in risk-taking behaviors. The moderating roles of parental monitoring and social support were also examined. We found that 2.8% (8,922) of students were experiencing homelessness, and youth homelessness was associated with engagement in a greater number of risk-taking behavior types. The association between youth homelessness and risk-taking behaviors was not moderated by parental monitoring, which was high for stably housed youth as well as homeless youth. Social support was a significant moderator. For stably housed youth, the presence of someone to talk to when youth were feeling sad was associated with engagement in fewer risk-taking behaviors. Conversely, for homeless youth, having someone to talk to when the youth were feeling sad was associated with higher engagement in risk-taking behaviors. Findings extend our understanding of risk-taking behaviors among homeless youth, a particularly vulnerable group of adolescents. The study has implications for prevention and intervention efforts to support homeless youth. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,J. Child.

The experiences of homeless youth when using strengths profiling to identify their character strengths,"Cooley, S.J.; Quinton, M.L.; Holland, M.J.G.; Parry, B.J.; Cumming, J.","Individuals, particularly those considered “hard-to-reach,” often engage well with assessment tools that involve active dialogue and the co-construction of knowledge. Strengths profiling is one such tool that enables a person-centered and autonomy supportive approach to the identification of character strengths. Strength profiling is an adaptation of performance profiling used in sport psychology, which has not yet been utilized in broader psychological research or clinical practice. Supporting an individual by raising awareness of their personal character strengths is an effective and growing mechanism for promoting psychological well-being. Strengths profiling involves several stages of exploring, defining, and assessing character strengths, leading to the identification of signature strengths and goals for future development. Informed by personal construct theory, the present study explored the experiences of homeless young people living in sheltered accommodation (N = 116), when using strengths profiling at the start and end of a 10-week, strengths-based intervention. Mixed-method data was obtained from the strengths profiles, questionnaires measuring resilience, self-worth, and well-being, and diary entries. Findings revealed a rich array of character strength terminology and individual meanings. Participants found strengths profiling to be highly engaging, particularly due to their active role in strength identification, which prompted interesting and meaningful reflections on character strengths that were pertinent to them. Participants felt their signature strengths were vital protective factors within their lives and strengths profiles were correlated with resilience, self-worth, and well-being. Character strengths and resilience were also significantly and meaningfully improved pre/post-intervention, providing support for the use of strengths profiling as a tool for monitoring change in character strength perceptions. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility and versatility of strengths profiling as a new method in the discipline of positive psychology and strengths-based research and applied practice. © 2019 Cooley, Quinton, Holland, Parry and Cumming.",2019,,Front.

Risk and protective factors for substance use among youth experiencing homelessness,"Tyler, K.A.; Ray, C.M.","Background: Though research finds that youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) have high rates of substance use, which can lead to numerous long-term negative health effects, less is known about both risk and protective factors for substance use. Moreover, even less is known about whether these factors differ for lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) youth compared to non-LGB youth. In the current study, we compared risk and protective factors for binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit drug use (i.e. substance use) among heterosexual and sexual minority YEH. Methods: The sample included 322 young people experiencing homelessness in the Midwestern United States and who were between 16 and 26 years of age. Almost one-half of our sample were female (N = 146; 45%) and 68 youth (21%) identified as LGB. Results: Youth who experienced more child physical abuse, ran away from home more frequently, and those who had a parent(s) with drug problems were more likely to have reported binge drinking in the past 30 days. Additionally, having parents with drug problems was associated with the use of marijuana and illicit drugs. Conversely, having higher parental monitoring while growing up reduced the likelihood of using marijuana and illicit drugs. Tests for interactions revealed that while self-efficacy had no relationship with the probability of binge drinking for heterosexual youth, as self-efficacy increased, the probability of binge drinking declined drastically for sexual minority youth suggesting this protective mechanism operates differently for these two groups of youth. Additionally, tests of interactions showed that the probability of binge drinking among heterosexual and sexual minority youth also varied by child sexual abuse and street sexual victimization. Conclusion: Study results have implications for service providers who serve YEH. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child. Youth Serv. Rev.,107,,,,10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104548,,#2087,Tyler 2019,,
"Times during transition for young people with complex support needs: entangled critical moments, static liminal periods and contingent meaning making times","Smith, L.; Dowse, L.","Youth studies has called for new ways of thinking about transitions for young people. This paper argues for new ways of understanding times during transition, particularly for young people with complex support needs. Young people (16–26 years) with complex support needs are those who experience multiple forms of social disadvantage, and who depend on siloed services to support them. Complex support needs are created by the intersection between a person and a complex system of services including education, health, disability, health, mental health, homelessness, youth justice and child protection. In this context, transition has been understood as a physical movement between and within separate services. Using the arts based method of body mapping with 31 young people with complex support needs from three Eastern states of Australia, this paper reports on how young people themselves experience transition. Young people identified three distinct times during transition that resonated with existing literature on critical moments, liminal periods and meaning making times. However, these times were not sequential or singular, nor were they a reflection of service transitions. Instead, this paper contends that times during transition were not as much about moving forward, as about simultaneously living with complex and chaotic pasts and presents. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,J.

"Text-messaging, online peer support group, and coaching strategies to optimize the HIV prevention continuum for youth: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Swendeman, D.; Arnold, E.M.; Harris, D.; Fournier, J.; Comulada, W.S.; Reback, C.; Koussa, M.; Ocasio, M.; Lee, S.-J.; Kozina, L.; Fernández, M.I.; Rotheram, M.J.","Background: America's increasing HIV epidemic among youth suggests the need to identify novel strategies to leverage services and settings where youth at high risk (YAHR) for HIV can be engaged in prevention. Scalable, efficacious, and cost-effective strategies are needed, which support youth during developmental transitions when risks arise. Evidence-based behavioral interventions (EBIs) have typically relied on time-limited, scripted, and manualized protocols that were often delivered with low fidelity and lacked evidence for effectiveness. Objective: This study aims to examine efficacy, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of easily mountable and adaptable, technology-based behavioral interventions in the context of an enhanced standard of care and study assessments that implement the guidelines of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine, repeat HIV, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing for high-risk youth. Methods: Youth aged between 12 and 24 years (n=1500) are being recruited from community-based organizations and clinics serving gay, bisexual, and transgender youth, homeless youth, and postincarcerated youth, with eligibility algorithms weighting African American and Latino youth to reflect disparities in HIV incidence. At baseline and 4-month intervals over 24 months (12 months for lower-risk youth), interviewers monitor uptake of HIV prevention continuum steps (linkage to health care, use of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis, condoms, and prevention services) and secondary outcomes of substance use, mental health, and housing security. Assessments include rapid diagnostic tests for HIV, STIs, drugs, and alcohol. The study is powered to detect modest intervention effects among gay or bisexual male and transgender youth with 70% retention. Youth are randomized to 4 conditions: (1) enhanced standard of care of automated text-messaging and monitoring (AMM) and repeat HIV/STI testing assessment procedures (n=690); (2) online group peer support via private social media plus AMM (n=270); (3) coaching that is strengths-based, youth-centered, unscripted, based on common practice elements of EBI, available over 24 months, and delivered by near-peer paraprofessionals via text, phone, and in-person, plus AMM (n=270); and (4) online group peer support plus coaching and AMM (n=270). Results: The project was funded in September 2016 and enrollment began in May 2017. Enrollment will be completed between June and August 2019. Data analysis is currently underway, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2019. Conclusions: This hybrid implementation-effectiveness study examines alternative models for implementing the CDC guidelines for routine HIV/STI testing for YAHR of acquiring HIV and for delivering evidence-based behavioral intervention content in modular elements instead of scripted manuals and available over 24 months of follow-up, while also monitoring implementation, costs, and effectiveness. The greatest impacts are expected for coaching, whereas online group peer support is expected to have lower impact but may be more cost-effective. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Individual and Social Network Correlates of Sexual Health Communication Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Craddock, J.B.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Combs, K.M.; Fulginiti, A.; Rice, E.","Despite the potential for sexual health communication to be leveraged for HIV prevention among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), there has yet to be a rigorous examination of individual and network or relational characteristics associated with sexual health communication in this group of young people. Cross-sectional survey and social network data from 1014 YEH aged 14–25 recruited in Los Angeles, California, were utilized to assess individual and network or relational characteristics associated with communication regarding condom use and HIV testing among YEH. Results suggest that social networks are key to understanding sexual health communication; YEH’s engagement in sexual health communication was significantly related to the composition of their networks. To increase testing and decrease new HIV cases, a prudent strategy would be to train existing social network members (e.g., staff members, home-based peers, or partners) as agents of change in naturally occurring social networks of YEH. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,AIDS Behav.,24,1,222-232,,10.1007/s10461-019-02646-x,,#2092,Craddock 2020,,

Prevalence and Correlates of Homelessness Among American Indian and Alaska Native Youth,"Morton, M.H.; Chávez, R.; Moore, K.","Youth homelessness is a serious national challenge affecting millions of young people every year. However, due to their relatively small population size, together with limitations related to data and research efforts on homelessness to date, prevalence estimates and evidence of homelessness experiences among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) youth have been scarce. This is particularly the case at the national level. We report findings on the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of AIAN youth experiencing homelessness that are based on a nationally representative survey on homelessness among adolescents and young adults, age 13 to 25. The overall national survey sample included 25,492 respondents. During a 12-month period, approximately 10.2% of AIAN households with 13–17 year olds reported youth homelessness or runaway experiences that lasted at least one night. For AIAN 18–25 year olds, the 12-month population prevalence of homelessness experiences was 12.2%. AIAN young adults had three times the prevalence rate of homelessness as their White non-Hispanic peers. Furthermore, most AIAN youth experiencing homelessness, like most AIAN people overall, reside in predominantly urban counties. Controlling for other variables, lower educational attainment, and parenting (especially if unmarried) were associated with higher likelihood of homelessness. There is a clear and urgent need for tailored, culturally-responsive homelessness prevention and intervention strategies, along with focused housing and support investments, for AIAN young people and the communities in which they live. The federal government and local jurisdictions need to take policy actions to address high rates of AIAN youth homelessness in urban and suburban communities, in addition to policies centered on AIAN reservations and rural communities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,J.

Optimal and non-discriminative rehabilitation program design for opioid addiction among homeless youth,"Yadav, A.; Singh, R.; Siapoutis, N.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Liang, Y.","This paper presents CORTA, a software agent that designs personalized rehabilitation programs for homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction. Many rehabilitation centers treat opioid addiction in homeless youth by prescribing rehabilitation programs which are tailored to the underlying causes of addiction. To date, rehabilitation centers have relied on ad-hoc assessments and unprincipled heuristics to deliver rehabilitation programs to homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction, which greatly undermines the effectiveness of the delivered programs. CORTA addresses these challenges via three novel contributions. First, CORTA utilizes a first-of-its-kind real-world dataset collected from ~1400 homeless youth to build causal inference models which predict the likelihood of opioid addiction among these youth. Second, utilizing counterfactual predictions generated by our causal inference models, CORTA solves novel optimization formulations to assign appropriate rehabilitation programs to the correct set of homeless youth in order to minimize the expected number of homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction. Third, we provide a rigorous experimental analysis of CORTA along different dimensions, e.g., importance of causal modeling, importance of optimization, and impact of incorporating fairness considerations, etc. Our simulation results show that CORTA outperforms baselines by ~110% in minimizing the number of homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction. © 2020 Inst.

In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen participants. Findings revealed the effects of colonization in the form of poor and overcrowded housing conditions in the northern First Nations, difficulties in obtaining affordable and suitable housing in northern towns and cities, reliance on the scarce social services for survival, and valiant attempts to cope with the cold climate of northern Ontario. All participants reported multiple and intergenerational experiences of separation from family due to involvement of child welfare system, placement in residential schools, death of family member(s), flooding, and epidemics. Participants described their lifelong struggles with mental health and substance abuse issues. All three phenomena were tied together in various configurations of causes and consequences. The implications include the need for critical examination of the historical policies and practices, early intervention for mental health and substance abuse issues, greater support for youth transitioning out of care, creation of a continuum of housing options, collaboration across multiple social services sectors, and incorporation of Indigenous worldview and practices in the mainstream services. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,J.

Common trust and personal safety issues: A systematic review on the acceptability of health and social interventions for persons with lived experience of homelessness,"Magwood, O.; Leki, V.Y.; Kpade, V.; Saad, A.; Alkhateeb, Q.; Gebremeskel, A.; Rehman, A.; Hannigan, T.; Pinto, N.; Sun, A.H.; Kendall, C.; Kozloff, N.; Tweed, E.J.; Ponka, D.; Pottie, K.","Background Persons experiencing homelessness and vulnerable housing or those with lived experience of homelessness have worse health outcomes than individuals who are stably housed. Structural violence can dramatically affect their acceptance of interventions. We carried out a systematic review to understand the factors that influence the acceptability of social and health interventions among persons with lived experience of homelessness. Methods We searched through eight bibliographic databases and selected grey literature sources for articles that were published between 1994 and 2019. We selected primary studies that reported on the experiences of homeless populations interacting with practitioners and service providers working in permanent supportive housing, case management, interventions for substance use, income assistance, and women- and youth-specific interventions. Each study was independently assessed for its methodological quality. We used a framework analysis to identify key findings and used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in the key findings. Findings Our search identified 11,017 citations of which 35 primary studies met our inclusion criteria. Our synthesis highlighted that individuals were marginalized, dehumanized and excluded by their lived homelessness experience. As a result, trust and personal safety were highly valued within human interactions. Lived experience of homelessness influenced attitudes toward health and social service professionals and sometimes led to reluctance to accept interventions. Physical and structural violence intersected with low self-esteem, depression and homeless-related stigma. Positive self-identity facilitated links to long-term and integrated services, peer support, and patient-centred engagement. Conclusions Individuals with lived experience of homelessness face considerable marginalization, dehumanization and structural violence. Practitioners and social service providers should consider anti-oppressive approaches and provide, refer to, or advocate for health and structural interventions using the principles of trauma-informed care. Accepting and respecting others as they are, without judgment, may help practitioners navigate barriers to inclusiveness, equitability, and effectiveness for primary care that targets this marginalized population. © 2019 Magwood et al.

This descriptive study presents cross-state comparison of the prevalence of young adult homelessness in Washington State, USA and Victoria, Australia using state representative samples from the International Youth Development Study (IYDS; n = 1945, 53% female). Associations between young adult homelessness and a range of co-occurring problems were examined using a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. Results showed significantly higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by young adults in Washington State (5.24% vs. 3.25% in Victoria). Cross-state differences were evident in levels of friends’ drug use, antisocial behavior, weekly income and support from peers. Unemployment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.67), antisocial behavior (AOR = 3.54) and victimization (AOR = 3.37) were more likely among young adults reporting homelessness in both states. Young adults with higher weekly income were less likely to report homelessness (AOR = 0.69) in both states. No significant association between mental health problem symptoms, substance use, family conflict or interaction with antisocial peers and homelessness were found in either state. Rates of violent behavior were more strongly related to young adult homelessness in Washington State than Victoria. The current findings suggest that programs that enable young adults to pursue income and employment, reduce antisocial behavior and include services for those who have been victimized, may help to mitigate harm among young adults experiencing homelessness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

“This Research Is Cool”: Engaging Youth Experiencing Homelessness in Research on Reproductive and Sexual Health,"Begun, S.; Weber, A.; Spring, J.; Arora, S.R.A.; Frey, C.; Fortin, A.","Youth experiencing homelessness face myriad barriers and inequities regarding their reproductive and sexual health and rights. Moreover, homeless youth are often characterized as “disaffiliated” and depicted as difficult to engage in research. This study qualitatively explored homeless youths’ attitudes, beliefs, and needs regarding reproductive and sexual health, and sought their perspectives on being involved in research on such topics, which are often thought of as “taboo” or sensitive. Youth were enthusiastic about openly discussing such issues, which they deemed as highly relevant to their daily lives. Youth identified that how they were engaged in such research, and having opportunities for longer-term contributions to such efforts, were both important and exciting to them. Future social work and public health research efforts should seek to further disrupt narratives of homeless youth as “disaffiliated” and difficult to engage, and in doing so, develop more creative, participatory, and youth-led opportunities for including this group in reproductive and sexual health research. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2020,,Soc.

"Youth Matters: Philly (YMP): Development, usability, usefulness, & accessibility of a mobile web-based app for homeless and unstably housed youth","Greeson, J.K.P.; Treglia, D.; Morones, S.; Hopkins, M.; Mikell, D.","Background: Young people experiencing homelessness accounted for about 7% of the total homeless population in the United States in 2018. These young people are among the most marginalized youth populations and face numerous hardships. Accessing and connecting with provider organizations is challenging for these young people for myriad reasons related to their marginalization and vulnerability. As a result, homeless and unstably housed youth exhibit low rates of health and social service utilization, despite high rates of need. Objectives: (1) To document the development of a mobile web-based app called Youth Matters: Philly (YMP) for young people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing that is designed to help them search, identify, locate, and utilize Philadelphia-based social and health services; and, (2) To explore youth's perceptions of the usability, usefulness, and accessibility of YMP. Methods: We used the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to assess young people's perceptions of YMP's usability, usefulness, and accessibility. Ten young people who either were currently experiencing homelessness/unstable housing or recently had experienced such hardship participated in the study. During a two-week window, participants logged onto YMP at least three times and searched for resources. They then completed the MARS. Participants were between the ages of 18 and 25 years old (M = 21.5 years; SD = 2.3 years), mostly female (67%), and mostly black/African American (67%). Thirty percent identified as Hispanic/Latinx. All had spent time in foster care and aged out, with an average length of 8.1 years in care (SD = 4.0 years). We used Qualtrics to collect all data and descriptive statistics to analyze all data in SPSS. Results: The mean scores on the subscales of the MARS (Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, and Information) ranged from 3.60 (Aesthetics) to 3.98 (Functionality; Information) out of 5. The mean score for overall Quality was 3.47 (out of 5). We also asked a set of questions specific to YMP to assess perceived impact of the app on the respondents’ awareness, knowledge, attitudes, help seeking, and behavior change related to experiencing homelessness and unstable housing. For all questions, at minimum, all participants “somewhat agreed.” Conclusions: YMP is a promising way to increase engagement and overcome barriers to accessing services for youth experiencing homelessness or unstable housing. Findings offer insights into ways to improve future versions of YMP. YMP also offers a model for other localities committed to improving access to services for young people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing. Future research directions for YMP and similar technology are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child. Youth Serv. Rev.,108,,,,10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104586,,#2113,Greeson 2020,,
Executive functions in homeless young people: Working memory impacts on short-term housing outcomes,"Fry, C.E.; Langley, K.; Shelton, K.H.","Most homeless young people have experienced multiple adversities, with potential implications for the development of Executive Functions (EFs), higher-order cognitive processes important for adaptation. EFs have been identified as putative contributors to the capacity to exit homelessness, however, little research has investigated EFs in homeless young people. To address gaps in current knowledge, this study compared executive function performance between homeless and housed young people. Relationships between EFs and short-term housing outcomes were also explored. Sixty-eight homeless young people (16–19 years) and 37 age-matched housed young people participated in this study. Computerized EF tasks spanned the domains of working memory, set shifting/flexibility, planning, impulsivity/risky decision making, selective attention/inhibition, and verbal fluency. Homeless young people demonstrated worse performance than housed youth on several EF tasks, particularly working memory and impulsivity/risky decision making. Working memory predicted progression into more independent accommodation; those with longer working memory spans were twice as likely to have progressed to more independent housing rather than maintained their current housing status after six months. Poorer EFs are associated with youth homelessness and also with an individual’s ability to progress towards independence. As such, EFs should not continue to be overlooked by researchers and service providers. Emerging adulthood, as a sensitive period for EF development, is an opportune time for intervention to increase the likelihood of positive housing outcomes in homeless young people. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Cognitive Impairment in Marginally Housed Youth: Prevalence and Risk Factors,"Waclawik, K.; Jones, A.A.; Barbic, S.P.; Gicas, K.M.; O'Connor, T.A.; Smith, G.N.; Leonova, O.; Mathias, S.; Barr, A.M.; Procyshyn, R.M.; Lang, D.J.; Woodward, M.L.; MacEwan, G.W.; Panenka, W.J.; Yamamoto, A.; Honer, W.G.; Thornton, A.E.","Objective: Homeless and marginally housed youth are particularly vulnerable members of society, and are known to experience numerous health problems, including psychiatric illness, substance use, and viral infection. Despite the presence of these risk factors for cognitive compromise, there is limited research on the cognitive functioning of homeless and marginally housed youth. The present study examines the degree and pattern of cognitive impairment and associations with key risk factors in a sample of marginally housed young adults. Method: Participants (N = 101) aged 20–29 years old were recruited from single-room occupancy hotels, and underwent cognitive, psychiatric, neurological, and serological assessments. Results: Forty percent of participants were identified as mildly cognitively impaired across multiple domains, and 16% were moderately-severely impaired. Deficits in memory and attention were most prevalent, while impairments in inhibitory control/processing speed and cognitive flexibility were also present but tended to be less severe. Developmental and historical factors (premorbid intellectual functioning, neurological soft signs, earlier exposure to and longer duration of homelessness or marginal housing), as well as current health risks (stimulant dependence and hepatitis C exposure), were associated with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The strikingly high rate of cognitive impairment in marginally housed young adults represents a major public health concern and is likely to pose a significant barrier to treatment and rehabilitation. These results suggest that the pathway to cognitive impairment involves both developmental vulnerability and modifiable risk factors. This study highlights the need for early interventions that address cognitive impairment and risk factors in marginalized young people. © Copyright © 2019 Waclawik, Jones, Barbic, Gicas, O'Connor, Smith, Leonova, Mathias, Barr, Procyshyn, Lang, Woodward, MacEwan, Panenka, Yamamoto, Honer and Thornton.",2019,,Front.

Focusing on Basic Needs as a Mechanism to Address Threats to Adolescents’ Personal Security,"Condie, L.O.; Condie, E.R.; Levine, H.B.","Overarching federal legislation and policies are needed that facilitate the integration of resources and interventions for runaway and abandoned adolescents. Despite legislative and public policy initiatives designed to address the needs of this population, implementation is inconsistent across jurisdictions and departments. The goal of this article is to highlight the details that impede forward-thinking mechanisms pertaining to runaway and abandoned youths. We summarize the epidemiology of adolescent maltreatment outcomes as precursors to runaway and abandoned status. We review the societal choices at stake. We describe the contrast between (a) initiatives that promote assurance of fulfillment of adolescents’ basic needs for food and shelter, safety, education, vocational training, and intervention access and (b) sanctions for adolescent misbehavior issued by representatives of juvenile and social service systems.

Associations of Tobacco Advertising Appeal With Intentions to Use Alternative Tobacco Products Among Young Tobacco Users Experiencing Homelessness,"Shadel, W.G.; Tucker, J.S.; Seelam, R.; Golinelli, D.; Siconolfi, D.","Purpose: Virtually nothing is known about the potential effects of tobacco advertising on tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness, a vulnerable population with high tobacco use rates. This study examines associations between the appeal of advertising for 5 classes of tobacco product (electronic cigarettes, hookah, cigars, cigarillos, and smokeless tobacco) and future intentions to use those products again among homeless youth who had indicated any level of lifetime use. Design: A cross-sectional design was used. Setting: Settings were 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Participants: A probability sample of 469 young tobacco users experiencing homelessness (mean age = 22; 71% male; 29% non-Hispanic White) was recruited. Measures: Assessments included product-specific tobacco advertising appeal and future intentions to use the product again, as well as a range of covariate controls (eg, demographics, homelessness severity, current tobacco use, general advertising exposure). Analysis: Linear regression tested for associations between the appeal of advertising for a specific tobacco product and intentions to use that product again in the future, controlling for myriad covariates. Results: Advertising appeal was positively associated with future intentions to use again for electronic cigarettes (P =.006) and hookah (P =.001), but not cigars (P =.486), cigarillos (P =.126), or smokeless tobacco (P =.109). Conclusion: Results suggest that advertising appeal may increase use of certain tobacco products among youth experiencing homelessness. However, differences in themes emphasized by advertising for specific tobacco products could differentially influence use in this population. © The Author(s) 2019.",2020,,Am. J.

"Sexual risk classes among youth experiencing homelessness: Relation to childhood adversities, current mental symptoms, substance use, and HIV testing","Maria, D.S.; Daundasekara, S.S.; Hernandez, D.C.; Zhang, W.; Narendorf, S.C.","The aim of this study was to determine whether there are meaningful subgroups with different types of sexual risk behaviors among youth experiencing homelessness and examine the associations between potential classes and other risk variables. A latent class analysis was used to identify classes of youth according to sexual risk behaviors and sexual assault. A two-class solution was found to be the best fit for the data–Lower and Higher Risk groups. The Higher Risk class had significantly higher levels of synthetic marijuana and alcohol use, mental health diagnoses, and were more likely to have been tested for HIV than the Lower Risk group. Youth were more likely to be in the Higher Risk group if they were cisgender female or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning (LGBQ). Nearly all youth (10/11) who reported having HIV infection were in the Higher Risk group. The Lower Risk group were sexually active but had lower rates of risk behaviors and sexual assault. Youth who were not sexually active had the lowest rates of marijuana and alcohol use as well as HIV testing. Health and social service providers should be aware of the added risks for stress, mental distress, mental health diagnoses, and substance use among youth who also report higher risk sexual behaviors and treat as needed. © 2020 Santa Maria et al.

Navigating peer-influences in a large youth homeless shelter in North America,"Alschech, J.; Taiwo-Hanna, T.; Shier, M.L.","Background: This study explored how youth who reside in a large youth homeless shelter in North America view and navigate peer-influences in the shelter. Research shows that peer influences in the lives of youth experiencing homelessness are both a risk factor and a protective factor. In order to inform the development of shelter policies and interventions that reduce and contain peer influences that put the residents at risk while cultivating peer support and cohesion, a better understanding of the residents’ views and insights regarding peer-influences is needed. Methods: Interviews (n = 27) were conducted with residents (aged 18–24) of a youth homeless shelter. Following a semi-structured open-ended interview guide, respondents were asked questions related to program outcomes and their experiences within the shelter that support those outcomes. One dominant factor emerging from the interview data analysis was the central role played by peer relationships and influences. Results: The residents described the shelter as housing two kinds of peer interactions. Perceived as positive peers’ influences were described as pivotal for successfully transitioning into stable, sustainable housing. Perceived as negative peer influences, on the other hand, were described as a significant risk for one's wellbeing and trajectory. The interviewees disclosed strategies for navigating peer influences in the shelter, such as withdrawing from any social involvement with the other residents or only allowing for shallow ephemeral friendships, as well as some of the challenges involved, such as the difficulty to sever relationships with peers one came to perceive as negative. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Child.

Symbolic Meaning of Violence: Urban African-American Adolescent Males’ Perspectives,"Outland, R.L.","This paper explores the symbolic meaning of violence based on urban African-American adolescent males’ (UAAMs) perspectives. Findings in this paper derived from a phenomenological investigation of UAAMs’ meanings and experiences of violence. Nine UAAMs participated in phenomenological interviews, and six in a focus group. Several themes emerged from the study, including violence as a means to gain respect, a form of intimidation, and self-defense. Implications for counselors and social service providers are discussed. Urban African-American adolescent males’ (UAAMs) experiences of violence have remained at alarming rates over the past decade. Despite some drops in these numbers in recent years, UAAMs are more likely to encounter episodes of violence, including poverty and homelessness, mass incarceration, and gun violence and homicides when compared to their white and racially diverse counterparts. Although researchers have investigated this phenomenon among UAAM and their urban peers from a variety of theoretical lenses and vantage points, limited research has investigated UAAMs’ meaning and experiences of violence, from the perspective of these developing young men. As a result, a gap in the literature lies in the fact that UAAMs’ narratives regarding their experiences and meanings of violence have been granted limited attention. Thus, UAAMs’ narratives about their experiences of violence may provide important solutions as to the causes and solutions of this phenomenon. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,J.

Specifically, limited research has considered different subgroups of students experiencing homelessness according to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (nonsheltered, sheltered, doubled up) in comparison with nonhomeless students. Using a representative sample ofCalifornia public high school students (N = 390,028), authors applied bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine differences among nonsheltered, sheltered, and doubled-up students experiencing homelessness regarding levels of discriminatory bullying, behavioral victimization, and weapon victimization at school. Findings show that students experiencing homelessness across all subgroups are at high risk of experiencing school violence. The severity of findings and differences among subgroups emphasize the need to develop school-based responses for each subgroup.

Elements of a College Support Program That Matter: A Case Study,"Huang, H.; Fernandez, S.B.; Rhoden, M.-A.; Joseph, R.",Purpose: This study focuses on a campus support program that serves former child welfare and homeless youth. This study aims to identify the program elements that help students transition into and succeed in college. Method: This study uses a mixed-method approach. Quantitative data included administrative and survey data of 50 students. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the effects of early engagement on students’ grade point averages (GPAs). Qualitative data were collected from interviews with 17 students. Thematic content analysis was used to identify themes from the qualitative data. Results: Quantitative data showed positive effects of early engagement on students’ GPAs. Qualitative data showed that students perceived that the campus support program helped them transition into and success in college. Conclusions: Future programs should emphasize providing academic and financial services and engaging students as soon as or even before they enroll into college. © The Author(s) 2019.,2019,,Res. Soc.

Overview of care for transgender children and youth,"Weiselberg, E.C.; Shadianloo, S.","Over the past decade, more and more children and adolescents are identifying as transgender and gender diverse (TGD). Often, they and their parents first turn to their primary care pediatrician for guidance and support. Therefore, in 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a policy statement focusing on the health care of TGD youth.4 The AAP acknowledges that many pediatricians have a lack of training in this area and therefore need to increase their knowledge base and expertise in order to provide culturally competent care. While most sexual and gender minority individuals are healthy and well adjusted, some TGD youth are at an increased risk of mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders and suicidality. This is theorized to be due to the experienced or internalized marginalization, stigmatization, victimization, harassment or rejection and not inherent in having gender dysphoria or being transgender. The pediatrician therefore needs to be knowledgeable of, and skilled to screen for, the health disparities that may exist, as well as to be able to support the individual who may disclose their gender identity status during treatment. Parents and guardians may also turn to the pediatrician for guidance when faced with their child who presents with gender non-conforming behaviors or gender dysphoria. Therefore the pediatrician needs to be able to guide the parents as well, as their acceptance and support of their child's journey to gender identity is probably the most important protective factor against health disparities encountered. To deliver optimum care for TGD children and youth, the pediatrician needs to establish an office setting that is inclusive, gender-neutral and TGD friendly. By becoming familiar with the diversity of gender expression and identities, use of gender-appropriate terminology, health disparities often encountered and the importance of providing a safe and welcoming environment, issues that are all covered in this article, the primary care pediatrician will be in position to provide comprehensive health care to this often marginalized population. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,,Curr.

Youth experiencing transitional and temporary homelessness: A pilot study,"Saldanha, K.; Raymond, D.M.","Homeless youth represent a vulnerable and understudied population, particularly those among them who are hidden, experiencing transitional or temporary homelessness. Little research focuses on this group, including the methods and settings to identify and tailor interventions to their circumstances. Given the immediate risks and possible transition to chronic homelessness, their identification is critical for prevention and intervention efforts. This exploratory pilot study investigated transitional and temporary homelessness among youth. The study demonstrated the ability to identify such participants. Twenty participants completed a survey that measured demographics, behavioral risk factors, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1993). Reports of relationships with parents varied. They included positive maternal relationships, but also concerns about intrafamilial conflict. While frequent change of schools was reported, generally positive feelings toward school were expressed. Social relationships suggest limited exposure to other homeless youth. Some substance abuse was noted, possibly at lower rates than expected for hard drugs. The BSI results are suggestive of health concerns. The study demonstrated that it is possible to capture children experiencing transitional or temporary homelessness in alternative school settings.

Why does de-radicalization seem a utopia? Evaluation on “children of the country” program,"Algristian, H.; Choiriya, D.D.; Abdillah, D.S.; Ulya, A.; Sodali, H.A.; Muhammad, A.R.","Children and adolescents are groups that are vulnerable to the radicalism influence. Curiosity and trial-error behaviour make them tend to do risk-taking behaviours. If it is not accompanied by good self-control ability, it will encourage them to do actions without thinking about the impact of these actions (impulsivity). If it is not accompanied by empathy, then it tends to be behaviour that opposes and disrupts the interests of others (aggressive behaviour). This study aimed to assess the “Children of the Country” program as an effort to de-radicalize children and adolescents. Quasi experimental study was used on 30 children and adolescents in a shelter of street children in Surabaya with a pre-test/post-test design. In order to measure the outcome of the program, a Radical Personality Test (RPT) was developed using big five personality construct.

Defining Homelessness in the Transition to Adulthood for Policy and Prevention,"Fowler, P.J.; Marcal, K.E.; Zhang, J.; Day, O.; Landsverk, J.","Objectives: The present study investigates the nature of homelessness among at-risk youth transitioning into adulthood. Current policies use multiple definitions to determine eligibility for homeless services among adolescents and emerging adults. Conflicting criteria demarcate different thresholds along an assumed continuum ranging from frequent mobility to living on the streets. Multiple eligibility criteria impede cohesive service provision and prevention efforts. Little research tests this continuum conceptualization, while developmental research suggests subgroups better capture homelessness in emerging adulthood. The present study leveraged prospective data on a national sample of child welfare-involved adolescents—a population vulnerable to homelessness in emerging adulthood. Methods: Youth report experiences of housing instability and homelessness 18–36 months after child welfare investigation, as well as adaptive functioning in multiple behavioral domains. Latent variable analyses test for a continuum of housing insecurity with reliable thresholds versus a typology capturing subgroups of co-occurring patterns of housing instability. Results: Results show little support for a continuum of risk; instead, three subgroups of housing instability emerge. The largest group, ‘Stably Dependent’ (83%) youth, live with family without attaining education and employment experiences necessary for independence. A smaller group labeled ‘Transients’ (12%) exhibit multiple housing and behavior problems typical of runaway youth. The smallest group, ‘Unstably Independent’ (5%), youth struggled to maintain housing in the absence of supportive adults.

However, little recent data exist describing STI positivity by anatomical site among those groups. We determined the positivity of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection, and syphilis antibody reactivity among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and homeless youth. Methods We recruited 1,264 adolescents with high risk behavior aged 12 to 24 years from homeless shelters, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations, community health centers, and using social media and online dating apps in Los Angeles, California and New Orleans, Louisiana from May 2017 to February 2019. Participants received point-of-care pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral/vaginal CT and NG testing and syphilis antibody testing. We calculated STI positivity by anatomical site and compared positivity by participant subgroups based on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, sex assigned at birth, and gender identity. Results CT and NG positivity and syphilis antibody reactivity was higher among HIV-infected adolescent men who have sex with men (MSM) than HIV-uninfected adolescent MSM (40.2% vs. 19%, P < 0.05), particularly CT or NG rectal infection (28% vs. 12.3%, P < 0.05). Of participants with positive CT or NG infections, 65% had extragenital-only infections, 20% had both extragenital and urogenital infections, and 15% had urogenital-only infections. Conclusions Sexually transmitted infection positivity was high, particularly among transgender women and MSM. The high proportion of rectal and pharyngeal infections highlights the importance of both urogenital and extragenital STI screening.

The Transition of Youth with ADHD into the Workforce: Review and Future Directions,"Gordon, C.T.; Fabiano, G.A.","Previous research suggests that a majority of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to experience increased impairment across multiple life domains into adulthood. A systematic review of the occupational impairments, and associated educational and financial difficulties, faced by individuals with childhood ADHD was conducted. Systematic searches from PsycINFO and PubMed databases and other sources (i.e., books and consultants with experts) yielded 35 relevant articles that described 19 longitudinal studies on adults with a history of ADHD or related symptoms. Multiple studies indicated that those with a history of ADHD had more educational impairment and were less likely to graduate from high school and college than their peers without a history of ADHD. Subsequently, they faced lower occupational attainment, had more job instability, and demonstrated more impaired job performance, and these outcomes were largely consistent regardless of sex, medication history, or symptom persistence. Similar results were found in clinical and representative national studies in both U.S. and abroad, although older studies tended to indicate less occupational impairment. In addition, ADHD was associated with a number of financial challenges, including lower annual income, more reliance on public aid, and increased risk for homelessness. Future research should use more varied informant sources and utilize innovative measures of occupational impairment at both a macro- and micro-level of analyses. In addition, studies of effective supports and interventions in occupational settings for individuals with ADHD are needed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,Clin.

The interRAI Suite of Mental Health Assessment Instruments: An Integrated System for the Continuum of Care,"Hirdes, J.P.; van Everdingen, C.; Ferris, J.; Franco-Martin, M.; Fries, B.E.; Heikkilä, J.; Hirdes, A.; Hoffman, R.; James, M.L.; Martin, L.; Perlman, C.M.; Rabinowitz, T.; Stewart, S.L.; Van Audenhove, C.","The lives of persons living with mental illness are affected by psychological, biological, social, economic, and environmental factors over the life course. It is therefore unlikely that simple preventive strategies, clinical treatments, therapeutic interventions, or policy options will succeed as singular solutions for the challenges of mental illness. Persons living with mental illness receive services and supports in multiple settings across the health care continuum that are often fragmented, uncoordinated, and inadequately responsive. Appropriate assessment is an important tool that health systems must deploy to respond to the strengths, preferences, and needs of persons with mental illness. However, standard approaches are often focused on measurement of psychiatric symptoms without taking a broader perspective to address issues like growth, development, and aging; physical health and disability; social relationships; economic resources; housing; substance use; involvement with criminal justice; stigma; and recovery. Using conglomerations of instruments to cover more domains is impractical, inconsistent, and incomplete while posing considerable assessment burden. interRAI mental health instruments were developed by a network of over 100 researchers, clinicians, and policy experts from over 35 nations. This includes assessment systems for adults in inpatient psychiatry, community mental health, emergency departments, mobile crisis teams, and long-term care settings, as well as a screening system for police officers. A similar set of instruments is available for child/youth mental health. The instruments form an integrated mental health information system because they share a common assessment language, conceptual basis, clinical emphasis, data collection approach, data elements, and care planning protocols. The key applications of these instruments include care planning, outcome measurement, quality improvement, and resource allocation. The composition of these instruments and psychometric properties are reviewed, and examples related to homeless are used to illustrate the various applications of these assessment systems. © Copyright © 2020 Hirdes, van Everdingen, Ferris, Franco-Martin, Fries, Heikkilä, Hirdes, Hoffman, James, Martin, Perlman, Rabinowitz, Stewart and Van Audenhove.",2020,,Front.

Substance use off and on school grounds: A California statewide comparison between different groups of homeless students and nonhomeless students,"Moore, H.; Astor, R.A.; Benbenishty, R.","About 1.3 million homeless students attend schools across the US, yet little is known about their substance use patterns, especially substance use on school grounds. The objectives of this study were to examine differences in substance use on and off school grounds between nonsheltered homeless, sheltered homeless, and nonhomeless public school students, and to examine the relationship between homelessness and substance use in school. Data were from a statewide representative sample from the California Healthy Kids Survey collected in 2011–2013, (n = 390,028). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied. Findings show that compared to nonhomeless students, homeless students, both sheltered and nonsheltered, reported higher rates of age at first time of use under the age of 10, and recent substance use, for an array of substances, indulging alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illegal drugs. Additionally about 50% of nonsheltered homeless students, and 15% of sheltered homeless students reported having used substances in school in the past 30 days. Results from logistic regressions indicate that homelessness is associated with substance use in school. Particularly, nonsheltered homeless students were 17.41, 12.09, 11.36 and 17.59 times more likely to report smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using marijuana and using other illegal drugs (respectively) in school in the past 30 days, compared to nonhomeless students. Sheltered homeless students were also more likely to use substances in school compared to nonhomeless students, but less likely compared to nonsheltered students. Findings highlight the need to develop differentiated school-based responses to each homeless subgroup and have conceptual, scientific and policy implications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Addict.

“She was there through the whole process:” Exploring how homeless youth access and select birth control,"Kachingwe, O.N.; Anderson, K.; Houser, C.; Fleishman, J.L.; Novick, J.G.; Phillips, D.R.; Aparicio, E.M.","Homeless female adolescents in the United States have disproportionately high rates of pregnancy compared to general population youth. Little is known about how homeless youth decide whether to use birth control and which birth control method to select. The current study explores how homeless female youth participating in a holistic sexual health program called Wahine (“woman”) Talk experience this process, using data from in-depth interviews (N = 3) with 11 homeless adolescent girls. Data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, proceeding through reading and re-reading, initial noting, forming emergent and super-ordinate themes, repeating steps for each interview, and developing final themes and subthemes. Four final themes emerged, which, for most participants, were experienced sequentially: Getting Acclimated, Becoming Close and Building Trust, Addressing Fear, and Making the Choice.

"Pathways to delinquency for street children in China: Institutional anomie, resilience and crime","Yu, Y.; Gao, Y.; Atkinson-Sheppard, S.","Delinquency of street children in China is prevalent, but the etiology of pathways into delinquency among street children in China has yet to be explored. By drawing on in-depth interviews with 40 street children in Kunming, China, this paper investigates the processes that lead street children to become involved in crime. The research finds that street children's pathways to delinquency occurs via three stages: (1) initial attempts to make a living through conventional activities; (2) involvement in the informal economic activity as a middle solution; and (3) engaging in instrumental crime as a last resort. Delinquent behavior is thus street children's natural adaptation when access to legitimate survival opportunities are eliminated by institutional exclusion to the formal labor market and because of the government's efforts to tackle child homelessness which often have negative consequences for children living on the streets. This reflects both anomie/strain theory and resilient perspectives, and this research constructs a model of anomie, resilience and crime. The article concludes by arguing that policy and practical implications for reducing street children crime in China should focus on providing life and work opportunities and help to raise awareness of street children in China and the mechanisms they use to assist their survival on the streets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child.

Psychosocial Conditions and Resilience Status of Street Children in Jimma Town,"Worku, B.N.; Urgessa, D.; Abeshu, G.","Background: Traditional research and practices focused on an investigation of risk factors to handle psychosocial problems street children faced while surviving on the street. However, more recently, attention has been given to how knowledge can be developed in the area to devise interventions that reflect the promotion of resilience as a means of achieving positive outcomes for the children. The purpose of this study was to explore the psychosocial conditions and resilience status of street children in Jimma Town. Methods: Explanatory sequential research design was employed. Out of 246 teenager street children, 137 were selected using simple random sampling. Questionnaire, interview guide and FGD probes were used in data collection. Mean and standard deviation, multiple regression analysis and Man Whitney U T-test were used to analyze quantitative data; while discourse analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Results: The result of multiple regression analysis indicated that anxiety significantly predicted resilience status, b=.623, t (109) =8.418, p<.001. Anxiety also explained a significant proportion of the variance in resilience status, R2=.388, F (112) = 70.86, p <.001. Further, the result revealed that street children had slow growing resilience status in which boys were more resilient than girls. Conclusion: Street children in Jimma Town faced various psychosocial challenges and had low resilience status. Thus, Jimma Town Women and Children Affairs Office ought to work to build resilience status of street children, in collaboration with different stakeholders in and around the town.",2019,,Ethiop J Health Sci,29,3,361-368,,10.4314/ejhs.v29i3.8,,#2167,Worku 2019,,
Overcome the problem of street children through life skill learning in west java Indonesia,"Bahar, H.; Hassan, Z.; Firas, H.","This study aims to provide solutions to the problems of street children through Life Skill learning. The research was conducted at Master Depok Primay School, Indonesia. 20 children are active as street children to fulfill their daily needs as family economic demands. Qualitative Research Methods, are case studies, involving teachers who play a role in developing life skills, they are two class teachers and two life skill teachers. Determination of research subjects was carried out by using purposive sampling technique, the results were specifically street children 9 people, five people in grade 4 and four people in grade 6. The techniques of collecting data were through observation, structured interviews, and study documentation. The results showed that street children in Depok Master School were included in the children on the street group, it means, children who had economic activities as child laborers on the road, but they still had strong relationships with their parents. Part of their income on the road is given to their parents. To overcome these problems, the life skill learning process is very instrumental in the life process of street children, for this reason a teacher’s strategy is needed in creating and innovating by continuing to improve pedagogical, personality, professional and social competencies. Support from various parties is needed to participate, both the government and the community to continue to provide guidance and supervision to parents that the act of releasing and letting children on the road, especially demanding them as breadwinners is illegal and violates children’s rights. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Strategies to treat and prevent hiv in the united states for adolescents and young adults: Protocol for a mixed-methods study,"Rotheram, M.J.; Fernandez, M.I.; Lee, S.-J.; Abdalian, S.E.; Kozina, L.; Koussa, M.; Comulada, W.S.; Klausner, J.D.; Arnold, E.M.; Ocasio, M.A.; Swendeman, D.; Weiss, R.; Brookmeyer, R.; Tang, W.; Nielsen-Saines, K.; Bryson, Y.; Kerin, T.; Shannon, C.; Cortado, R.; Mitchell, K.; Milburn, N.; Reback, C.; Lightfoot, M.; Harris, D.; Fournier, J.","Background: Over 20% of HIV diagnoses in the United States are among youth aged 12-24 years. Furthermore, youth have the lowest rates of uptake and adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) medications and are least aware of their HIV status. Objective: Our objective was to design a set of interrelated studies to promote completion of each step of the HIV Prevention Continuum by uninfected youth at high risk (YHR), as well as completion of steps in the Treatment Continuum by youth living with HIV (YLH). Methods: Gay, bisexual, and transgender youth; homeless youth; substance-abusing youth; youth with criminal justice contact; and youth with significant mental health challenges, particularly black and Latino individuals, are being recruited from 13 community-based organizations, clinics, drop-in centers, and shelters in Los Angeles and New Orleans. Youth are screened on the basis of self-reports and rapid diagnostic tests for HIV, drug use, and sexually transmitted infections and, then, triaged into one of 3 studies: (1) an observational cohort of YLH who have never received ARV medications and are then treated—half initially are in the acute infection period (n=36) and half with established HIV infection (n=36); (2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for YLH (N=220); and (3) an RCT for YHR (N=1340). Each study contrasts efficacy and costs of 3 interventions: an automated messaging and weekly monitoring program delivered via text messages (short message service, SMS); a peer support intervention delivered via social media forums; and coaching, delivered via text message (SMS), phone, and in-person or telehealth contacts. The primary outcomes are assessing youths’ uptake and retention of and adherence to the HIV Prevention or Treatment Continua. Repeat assessments are conducted every 4 months over 24 months to engage and retain youth and to monitor their status. Results: The project is funded from September 2016 through May 2021. Recruitment began in May 2017 and is expected to be completed by June 2019. We expect to submit the first results for publication by fall 2019. Conclusions: Using similar, flexible, and adaptable intervention approaches for YLH and YHR, this set of studies may provide a roadmap for communities to broadly address HIV risk among youth. We will evaluate whether the interventions are cost-efficient strategies that can be leveraged to help youth adhere to the actions in the HIV Prevention and Treatment Continua. © Mary Jane Rotheram, Maria Isabel Fernandez, Sung-Jae Lee, Sue Ellen Abdalian, Leslie Kozina, Maryann Koussa, Warren Scott Comulada, Jeffrey D Klausner, Elizabeth Mayfield Arnold, Manuel A Ocasio, Dallas Swendeman, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network (ATN) CARES Team.

Canadian response to need for transformation of youth mental health services: ACCESS Open Minds (Esprits ouverts),"Malla, A.; Iyer, S.; Shah, J.; Joober, R.; Boksa, P.; Lal, S.; Fuhrer, R.; Andersson, N.; Abdel-Baki, A.; Hutt-MacLeod, D.; Beaton, A.; Reaume-Zimmer, P.; Chisholm-Nelson, J.; Rousseau, C.; Chandrasena, R.; Bourque, J.; Aubin, D.; Levasseur, M.A.; Winkelmann, I.; Etter, M.; Kelland, J.; Tait, C.; Torrie, J.; Vallianatos, H.","Aim: Youth mental health is of paramount significance to society globally. Given early onset of mental disorders and the inadequate access to appropriate services, a meaningful service transformation, based on globally recognized principles, is necessary. The aim of this paper is to describe a national Canadian project designed to achieve transformation of mental health services and to evaluate the impact of such transformation on individual and system related outcomes. Method: We describe a model for transformation of services for youth with mental health and substance abuse problems across 14 geographically, linguistically and culturally diverse sites, including large and small urban, rural, First Nations and Inuit communities as well as homeless youth and a post-secondary educational setting. The principles guiding service transformation and objectives are identical across all sites but the method to achieve them varies depending on prevailing resources, culture, geography and the population to be served and how each community can best utilize the extra resources for transformation. Results: Each site is engaged in community mapping of services followed by training, active stakeholder engagement with youth and families, early case identification initiatives, providing rapid access (within 72 hours) to an assessment of the presenting problems, facilitating connection to an appropriate service within 30 days (if required) with no transition based on age within the 11 to 25 age group and a structured evaluation to track outcomes over the period of the study. Conclusions: Service transformation that is likely to achieve substantial change involves very detailed and carefully orchestrated processes guided by a set of values, principles, clear objectives, training and evaluation. The evidence gathered from this project can form the basis for scaling up youth mental health services in Canada across a variety of environments. © 2018 The Authors Early Intervention in Psychiatry Published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2019,,Early Intervent.

Communication barriers among children in difficult situations,"Carpizo, M.G.","This situational analysis covered the cities of Caloocan, Tacloban, and Zamboanga, Philippines. Target groups were the children who experienced man-made induced emergency situations such as armed conflicts, and natural disasters like earthquakes and typhoons. These also include children who have experienced violence and discrimination at home or in the community, those who have been separated from their families, and those who have left home to live in the streets; focusing about the needs and concerns of the sector and the gaps in the policy and programs in the areas of prevention and response to identified needs and concerns. A desk review of existing literature or materials about the sector was undertaken prior to collection of data from primary sources such as the boys and girls on the move through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, observations and other forms of data collection procedures. Through the latter activities, the findings drawn from the desk review were verified and updated. The purpose of focus group discussion was to generate responses from the target sector about the topics at hand. A group of ten to fifteen (10-15) members was formed composed of boys and girls in difficult situations which was led by a facilitator/moderator (interviewer) in a loosely structured discussion of the five main questions: a. What are the needs and concerns of children (girls and boys) in difficult situations? (gender influences); b. What are the circumstances of their movement from place of origin, in transit, and to their destination? c. What are the current programs, services, and mechanisms at various stages of their movement to respond to their concerns? d. What are the current gaps in the overall policy and response to the needs and concerns of children in difficult situations? e. What are the communication barriers faced by children in difficult situations? To substantiate and verify the findings of the desk review and focus group discussion; and to collect additional data to fill the gaps drawn; the key informant interview with people in the community particularly on the situations of children on the move was conducted for purpose of collecting information from the community leaders, professionals, or residents-who have firsthand knowledge about the issue. These community experts, with their particular knowledge and understanding, have provided insights on the nature of problems and have given recommendations for solutions. As described by children in difficult situations in Caloocan, the journey was arduous, at times nauseating. They experienced insomnia in fear of what could happen to them along the way. Some seek refuge with their relatives, some moved out to live near their parents', and some look for urban vacant spaces where they erect shanty houses out of scraps in search for transient jobs nearby. Typhoon Yolanda brought many children homeless, lost families and hope which caused them trauma. The devastation was severe, bills were unimportant which resulted to loots and scavenging. looting period however periled children. Adolescent girls always had difficulties in moving places to places which were accompanied by series of situations they have to deal with; carrying their heavy baggage, looking after their younger siblings, and no food to eat are just some of it. Following the devastating event of Yolanda, displaced children wandered around the city; traumatized, barefooted, cold, famished, and wounded, looking for their families and food. Children were also complaining about their transient refuges. The temperature and humidity are a problem, causing a lot of illnesses such as colds and fever to escalate. The Department of Social Welfare and Development has identified programs for the children and youth which address the children in difficult situations. Children who are displaced during the Zamboanga Siege were given relief goods by various organizations - both government and non-government, some even hosted health awareness programs and health missions such as immunization and counseling. Despite the various programs addressing these displaced children's welfare, communication draws a line between the organizations that program children's welfare and the children themselves. Being displaced, undocumented, and the lack of the ability to express their needs, children in difficult situations do not receive the benefits of the programs created for them. Some enjoy the benefits the organizations give them but do they really wanted or needed it. Most of the organizations simply provide what are necessities like food and shelter which has drawbacks especially to children who need more than just that said needs. There are many reasons why interpersonal communication may fail between the child and the humanitarian. Barriers may lead to messages becoming distorted and therefore wasting both time and money causing confusion and misunderstanding. As humanitarian attending children in difficult situations, they should know what are the barriers that may hinder the purpose of helping them. Counsel and education may help the children to express their thoughts about their needs and wants. © 2019 Asian E F L Journal Press.

Seen or Unseen? The Role of Race in Police Contact among Homeless Youth,"Ivanich, J.D.; Warner, T.D.","Homeless youth are at an increased risk of police contact—being stopped by police and arrested, yet it is less clear if this interaction is patterned by race. The current study draws on diverse scholarship to examine three possible effects of race on homeless youths’ interaction with police: that non-White homeless youth are more likely (disproportionate minority contact/symbolic assailants), less likely (out-of-place policing) or no different than White youth (master status) to experience police contact. Using the Midwest Longitudinal Study of Homeless Adolescents, we examine homeless youths’ odds of self-reported police harassment and arrest. Non-White homeless youth are more likely to report police harassment and arrest, but living on the street neutralizes these racial disparities. Further, prior police harassment is linked to subsequent arrest, operating similarly for White and non-White homeless youth. We discuss the implications of these findings for advancing scholarship on the challenges faced by homeless youth. © 2018, © 2018 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.",2019,,Justice Q.,36,5,816-840,,10.1080/07418825.2018.1463389,,#2179,Ivanich 2019,,
Exploring the Relationship Between Foster Care Experiences and HIV Risk Behaviors Among a Sample of Homeless Former Foster Youth,"Yoshioka-Maxwell, A.; Rice, E.","Recent research shows high rates of poor behavioral health outcomes among homeless former foster youth, including increased risk for HIV-risk behaviors. In the current study, data were collected from 184 youth at drop-in centers in Los Angeles using behavioral health questionnaires to explore the relationships between specific aspects of foster care experiences and engagement in HIV-risk behaviors. Results indicated that youth whose first homelessness experience occurred before leaving foster care were significantly more likely to engage in drug use with sex and exchange sex than those whose first homelessness experience occurred after leaving foster care. Intervention services targeting HIV-risk behaviors should consider the aspects of foster care placements that may increase the risk of these behaviors, such as long periods of placement or experiencing homelessness before exiting foster care, as well as those that may decrease the risk of these behaviors, such as exiting placement at an older age. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,AIDS Behav.,23,3,792-801,,10.1007/s10461-019-02417-8,,#2181,Yoshioka-Maxwell 2019,,
"Mobile intervention for individuals with psychosis, dual disorders, and their common comorbidities: A literature review","Pennou, A.; Lecomte, T.; Potvin, S.; Khazaal, Y.","Over 50% of people diagnosed with a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, will meet criteria for a substance use disorder in their lifetime. This dual disorder often starts during youth and leads to significant societal costs, including lower employability rates, more hospitalizations, and higher risk of homelessness and of suicide attempts when compared to those with a serious mental illness without substance misuse. Moreover, many individuals presenting with comorbid disorders also present with other psychological difficulties as well, such as personality disorders or anxiety and depression, also known as complex comorbid disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments that focus on core difficulties found in people with complex dual disorders, such as emotional regulation, are direly needed. Emotional regulation skills can help reduce distress related to psychotic symptoms and maintain abstinence in substance use disorders. New technologies in the field of communications have developed considerably over the past decade and have the potential to improve access to such treatments, a major problem in many health care settings. As such, this paper aims at: presenting core difficulties present in many individuals with dual disorders, reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the use of mobile applications in mental health and addictions, and presenting the development and potential of a new application for emotional regulation for people with dual disorders.

Food Insecurity and Unmet Needs Among Youth and Young Adults Living With HIV in the San Francisco Bay Area,"Reeder, C.; Neilands, T.B.; Palar, K.; Saberi, P.","Purpose: Little is known about food insecurity and unmet subsistence needs and their association with antiretroviral therapy adherence among youth and young adults living with HIV (YLWH). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine this association in 101 YLWH (aged 18–29 years). Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Approximately 51.7% of participants experienced at least one unmet subsistence need (difficulty finding enough to eat [36.6%], clothing [22.8%], place to sleep [21.8%], place to wash [17.8%], and bathroom [15.8%]), and 64.2% reported being food insecure. For every additional unmet need, the risk of very good/excellent adherence was reduced by 15% (RR = .85; 95% CI = .72–.99; p value = .04). The risk of very good/excellent adherence was lowered by 39% (RR = .61; 95% CI = .43–.87; p value = .005) among food insecure youth, compared with those who were food secure.

Group-fairness in influence maximization,"Tsang, A.; Wilder, B.; Rice, E.; Tambe, M.; Zick, Y.","Influence maximization is a widely used model for information dissemination in social networks. Recent work has employed such interventions across a wide range of social problems, spanning public health, substance abuse, and international development (to name a few examples). A critical but understudied question is whether the benefits of such interventions are fairly distributed across different groups in the population; e.g., avoiding discrimination with respect to sensitive attributes such as race or gender. Drawing on legal and game-theoretic concepts, we introduce formal definitions of fairness in influence maximization. We provide an algorithmic framework to find solutions which satisfy fairness constraints, and in the process improve the state of the art for general multi-objective submodular maximization problems. Experimental results on real data from an HIV prevention intervention for homeless youth show that standard influence maximization techniques oftentimes neglect smaller groups which contribute less to overall utility, resulting in a disparity which our proposed algorithms substantially reduce. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Defending suburbia: Exploring the use of defensive urban design outside of the city centre,"Chellew, C.","Defensive urban design, also known as hostile, unpleasant, or exclusionary architecture is an intentional design strategy that uses elements of the built environment to guide or restrict behaviour in urban space as a form of crime prevention, protection of property, or order maintenance. It often targets people who use or rely on public space more than others, like people who are homeless and youth, by restricting the behaviours they engage in. From benches specially designed to prevent lying down to the addition of elements that are meant to deter skateboarding, forms of defensive design vary according to the behaviour it is intended to restrict. While much of the current research on the subject privileges the urban centre as the site of research, this paper expands the focus from the centre to the periphery. Taking two public spaces in Toronto's inner suburb of North York as a starting point, this paper examines how defensive urban design is used regulate, control, and maintain public space outside of the city centre.

Integrated Systems Approaches: Creative applications for working with disengaged youth,"Gatfield, E.; Winter-Simat, N.","Acknowledging the central role secondary schools can play in establishing socially inclusive cultures, this article proposes an Integrated Systems Approach (ISA) as a salient model of practice. This model emerges from a secondary school specialising in engaging students with a range of complex challenges including learning difficulties, family dysfunction, risk of homelessness and substance misuse. To address these psychosocial complexities educator-researchers prioritise relationship development, personal accountability and self-reflection within a broad, creative education that engages students in transformative learning experiences. Utilising the ISA model, practitioners aim to increase students’ resilience and engage them in their own continued growth. This is done through revitalising family connections, connecting students with appropriate services, fostering positive peer associations, and capitalising on staff guidance. While acknowledging the limitations of many conventional Australian education contexts, a closing case study illustrates how the ISA embodies inclusive education, with applications to secondary schools. © 2019, Griffith University.

Race/ethnicity and foster youth outcomes: An examination of disproportionality using the national youth in transition database,"Watt, T.; Kim, S.","Children of color are over-represented in the child welfare system. Research suggests that disproportionality is predominately attributable to the resource poor environments in which these children are raised. However, it is important to understand whether the child welfare system is able to diminish these societal level inequities, and consequently disproportionality, by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes of youth exiting state care. Encouragingly, research in this area has found few racial/ethnic differences in the outcomes of former foster youth. However, these studies are regional and have not investigated outcomes for a broad array of racial/ethnic groups. To fill this gap, the present study uses the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) to examine educational attainment, employment, homelessness, and incarceration for white, African-American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native emancipated youth. Results reveal that African-American youth are less likely to be employed and more likely to report incarceration than white youth. However, African-American youth were 36% more likely to enroll in higher education than white youth and there were no significant differences in outcomes between white and Hispanic youth. However, AI/AN youth exhibited no advantages and significant disadvantages relative to youth from other racial/ethnic groups. Results suggest that child welfare services and state supports for youth exiting care can contribute to improved outcomes and racial/ethnic parity. However, additional effort is needed to reduce poor outcomes, particularly for American Indian/Alaska Native youth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child. Youth Serv.

Assessment of certain aspects and health issues that encountered by street children and adolescents in kirkuk city,"Mahmood, N.; Kumait, A.S.; Othman, S.; Al-Tawil, N.","Street children refer to children who experience homelessness and live on streets. They are the most vulnerable group to political and economic changes. We conducted this study to assess the health problems that face street children in Kirkuk city as well as to identify the demographic characteristics of those children. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1, 2014 to April 1, 2015 in Kirkuk-Iraq. Data were collected in various settings including markets, streets, playgrounds, etc., a convenience sample of 150 children was selected by interviewing the children. Data analysis was done via using descriptive statistics, which included frequency and percentages. The findings of the study showed that 50% of the children aged more than 15 years of which, 80.7% were males, and 58% of them were refugees. Because of their being street children, poverty constitutes 81.3%. 50.7% of the children was selling wares, 59.3% of them had faced maltreatment, and 54.3% of the children had received treatment for headache.

Boys who work on the streets of Iraq are exposed to more traumatic events such as torture than schoolboys of the same age,"Taib, N.I.; Ahmad, A.","Aim: Information is scarce about the issues faced by street working. This study examined traumatic events experienced by boys working on the streets of Iraq compared to schoolboys. Methods: We compared 100 street working boys aged 8–16 years who were attending a drop-in centre for street working children in Duhok City, Kurdistan, Iraq, in 2004/2005 with 100 age-matched schoolboys randomly selected from six local schools. The instruments that were used included the Harvard–Uppsala Trauma Questionnaire for Children. Results: Most of the street working boys were involved in activities such as selling goods or shoe shining, and some were stealing or begging. None were involved in drugs or prostitution. The street working boys showed a significantly higher rate of traumatic events than the control group (96% versus 64%, p < 0.001) and higher rates of moderate to severe trauma levels (78% versus 25%, p < 0.001). A varying degree of association was found for reporting different traumatic events. The largest effect size was found for torture, with an odds ratio of 28.4, and the smallest for maltreatment or assault (2.7).

Correlates of cigarette and alternative tobacco product use among young tobacco users experiencing homelessness,"Tucker, J.S.; Shadel, W.G.; Golinelli, D.; Seelam, R.; Siconolfi, D.","Introduction: Most young people experiencing homelessness smoke cigarettes, but little is known about use of alternative tobacco products (ATPs) such as e-cigarettes or other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs). This study examines past month use and correlates of cigarettes and ATP among young tobacco users experiencing homelessness. Methods: We surveyed a probability sample of N = 469 unaccompanied homeless 13–25 year olds (mean age = 22; 71% male), who reported past month use of any type of tobacco product, from 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Results: Nearly all (90%) participants reported smoking regular cigarettes, and 78% reported using at least one tobacco product other than regular cigarettes. The most commonly used of these other products was natural cigarettes (55%), followed by LCCs (43%), ENDS (34%), cigars (31%), hookah (14%), chewing tobacco (7%), and snus (5%). Multivariable models indicated that correlates of past month use differed by product, but included sociodemographic characteristics, homelessness severity, depression, exposure to other people who used the product, and product perceptions (e.g., relative access, cost, and harm compared to cigarettes). Conclusion: Use of cigarettes and ATPs are both widespread among young homeless tobacco users, suggesting that efforts to reduce tobacco use in this population should have a broad focus that includes a variety of products. The effectiveness of these efforts may be enhanced by addressing their considerable exposure to other tobacco users, as well as their perceptions of certain products as being less harmful or more cost-effective options than regular cigarettes. © 2019",2019,,Addict.

Asthma hospitalizations among homeless children in New York state,"Sakai-Bizmark, R.; Chang, R.-K.R.; Mena, L.A.; Webber, E.J.; Marr, E.H.; Kwong, K.Y.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Asthma is widely prevalent among US children, particularly in homeless children, who often lack proper medication storage or the ability to avoid environmental triggers. In this study, we assess asthma-attributed health care use among homeless youth. We hypothesize that asthma hospitalization rates, symptom severity, and admission through the emergency department (ED) will be higher among homeless youth compared with nonhomeless youth. METHODS: This secondary data analysis identified homeless and nonhomeless pediatric patients (,18 years old) with a primary diagnosis of asthma from New York statewide inpatient databases between 2009 and 2014. Hospitalization rate, readmission rate, admission through the ED, ventilation use, ICU admittance, hospitalization cost, and length of stay were measured. RESULTS: We identified 71 837 asthma hospitalizations, yielding 73.8 and 2.3 hospitalizations per 1000 homeless and nonhomeless children, respectively. Hospitalization rates varied by nonhomeless income quartile, with low-income children experiencing higher rates (5.4) of hospitalization. Readmissions accounted for 16.0% of homeless and 12.5% of nonhomeless hospitalizations. Compared with nonhomeless patients, homeless patients were more likely to be admitted from the ED (odds ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.82-2.12; P < .01), and among patients >5 years old, homeless patients were more likely to receive ventilation (odds ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.09; P = .04). No significant differences were observed in ICU admittance, cost, or length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless youth experience an asthma hospitalization rate 31 times higher than nonhomeless youth, with higher rates of readmission. Homeless youth live under uniquely challenging circumstances. Tailored asthma control strategies and educational intervention could greatly reduce hospitalizations.

The impact of risk environments on LGBTQ2S adults experiencing homelessness in a midsized Canadian city,"Bardwell, G.","The impacts of social, structural, and physical environments on homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and two-spirit (LGBTQ2S) adults were examined. Qualitative interviews were conducted. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Participants discussed the ways in which social, structural, and physical environments negatively affected their experiences of homelessness, particularly those in emergency shelters. Discrimination, harassment, and group dynamics (social); exclusionary policies and lack of training (structural); and limited accommodations as well as gendered spaces (physical) created heightened vulnerability and risks for participants. The “risk environment framework” is utilized to help understand these experiences, moving the discussion away from a neoliberal discourse of risk behaviors that individualize experiences, revealing how environments create risk. The inclusion of LGBTQ2S adults in this study highlights similar experiences to youth. The findings also emphasize the need for services to consider the ways in which an emphasis on LGBTQ2S youths can render the experiences of adults invisible. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,J.

Intrapersonal and social–contextual factors related to psychological well-being among youth experiencing homelessness,"Stewart, K.; Townley, G.","Homeless youth are adolescents and young adults who do not have stable dwellings but instead live on the streets, in shelters, or in other unstable situations. Although researchers have begun examining well-being among this population, little is known about components of well-being that are relevant to homeless youth or which factors predict differences in well-being. This study examined psychological well-being and its associations with demographic characteristics, intrapersonal factors (mental health, optimism, and self-esteem), and social–contextual factors (social support, sense of community, and empowerment) among 100 youth experiencing homelessness. All of the intrapersonal and social–contextual variables were associated with well-being at the bivariate level.

It is the first known study of teenage parenting and homelessness among Native Hawaiian youth, a key affected population. Interpretative phenomenological analysis of participants' individual interviews revealed three themes that characterize the experience of parenting as a teen while homeless: (a) They never raised me up (childhood experiences); (b) becoming mommy and daddy (early experiences of teen pregnancy and parenting while homeless); and (c) finding our place (current experiences of teen parenting and perspectives on teen pregnancy and homelessness).

Positive attributes and life satisfaction in homeless youth,"Rew, L.; Slesnick, N.; Johnson, K.; Aguilar, R.; Cengiz, A.","The purpose of this secondary analysis of data from an ongoing, longitudinal intervention study for homeless youths (ages 18–24 years) was threefold: (1) to differentiate by age, sex, and sexual orientation, the positive attributes of hope, optimism, resilience, future time perspective, and gratitude, (2) to determine how these positive attributes might be related to life satisfaction, and (3) to determine which set of variables might best explain life satisfaction. We found a statistically significant difference in resilience scores by sex, H(2) = 6.591, p =.037, with males scoring higher than females. None of the other positive attributes differed significantly by sex. Future time perspective (FTP) differed significantly by sexual orientation with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth scoring higher than others on FTP (p =.046). All theoretical variables (hope, optimism, FTP, resilience, and gratitude) were significantly related to life satisfaction (p <.01). After controlling for all other variables, hope and gratitude significantly explained variance in life satisfaction (p <.001). This analysis supports the claim that despite their vulnerabilities and limitations, homeless youths have many positive attributes that are related to their life satisfaction. It may be that future interventions focused on positive attributes of hope and gratitude can be developed to further enhance psychological capital and contribute to life satisfaction among these young people. © 2019",2019,,Child.

Gay, bisexual, and transgender youth (GBTY), homeless youth, and youth with histories of drug use, mental health disorders, and incarceration are all at uniquely high risk for STIs. However, these adolescents often lack access to sexual health services. Objective: This study aims to use point-of-care STI tests in community-based settings to screen for and treat STIs in adolescents. Methods: We are recruiting 1500 HIV-uninfected youth and 220 HIV-infected youth from homeless shelters, GBTY organizations, and community health centers in Los Angeles, California and New Orleans, Louisiana. Study participants will receive STI screening every 4 months for 24 months. STI screening includes rapid HIV, syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Hepatitis C virus testing. Trained paraprofessionals will conduct all STI testing. When a participant screens positive for an STI, they are either linked to a partner medical clinic or provided with same-day antibiotic therapy and expedited partner therapy. We will monitor STI prevalence among study participants as well as point-of-care test performance, linkage to care, and treatment outcomes. Results: The project was funded in 2016, and enrollment will be completed in 2019. Preliminary data analysis is currently underway. Conclusions: As STI rates continue to rise, it is important to improve access to screening and treatment services, particularly for high-risk adolescents. In this study, we aim to evaluate the use of point-of-care STI diagnostic tests in community-based organizations. We hope to determine the prevalence of STIs among these adolescents and evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of community-based STI screening and treatment. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Poverty, vulnerability and everyday resilience: How Bangladeshi street children manage economic challenges through financial transactions on the streets","Reza, Md.H.; Bromfield, N.F.","In Bangladesh, an estimated one to three million street children face poverty, violence and social stigma daily. This qualitative study of seventy-five child participants from three sites in Dhaka, Bangladesh, explores how street children in Bangladesh engage in financial transactions in their social networks to build resiliency and sustain contextual well-being under conditions of extreme adversity. For these street children, contextual well-being refers to the context of living and surviving on the street (i.e. access to food, shelter, safety, sense of belonging). Our findings indicate that both significant vulnerabilities and adaptive responses in street children’s lives are common across participants. Daily life for these children consists of attaining money and then spending it quickly as a means of survival. Significant vulnerabilities for these children are the need to engage in daily income generation along with income uncertainty; an adaptive response among the participants is the engagement in financial transactions within their peer networks. Findings also show that street children are deeply embedded in these social networks, which work to sustain their well-being. We argue that interventions for Bangladeshi street children should be peer-based, grounded in a strengths perspective, and promote resilience. © The Author(s) 2018.

Screening for human trafficking among homeless young adults,"Chisolm-Straker, M.; Sze, J.; Einbond, J.; White, J.; Stoklosa, H.","Human trafficking is a public health issue affecting homeless young adults across the United States; however, screening tools for trafficking specifically for this population are lengthy and onerous. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, brief, and user-friendly trafficking screening tool for homeless young adults. Five candidate items for the screening tool were identified from the Vera Institute's Trafficking Victim Identification Tool (TVIT). Study participants were asked the five candidate items, and then received a trafficking assessment using the Human Trafficking Identification and Measurement (HTIAM-14), which is validated for the homeless youth population. A multivariable logistic model was used to analyze the five candidate items in relation to a trafficking experience on the longer HTIAM-14. Homeless people, aged 18 to 22 years old, receiving support from Covenant House New Jersey were eligible to participate in the study. Over 15 months in 2015–2017, 340 trafficking assessments were performed for 307 participants; 8.8% (30) of the assessments revealed a human trafficking experience. Of assessments identifying a trafficking experience, 66.7% (20) found sex trafficking and 46.7% (14) labor trafficking, with 16.7% (5) demonstrating both forms of trafficking. We validated a new screening tool, Quick Youth Indicators for Trafficking (QYIT). QYIT allows providers to screen for trafficking among homeless young adults; an affirmative answer to at least one QYIT question is 86.7% sensitive and 76.5% specific in identifying a trafficking experience. QYIT is the first highly sensitive, comprehensive trafficking screening tool that is truly brief and does not require a trafficking expert to administer.

Yet, little research has focused on the features of effective settings for RHY. The present qualitative study, grounded in the Youth Program Quality Assessment model, explored characteristics of higher quality organizations for RHY and gaps that remain from staff and RHY perspectives. A total of 29 diverse settings serving RHY in New York State were randomly selected for participation, and ranked on a quantitative program quality index. Within settings, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with program administrators (N = 30) and other staff (N = 24). Focus group interviews were conducted with RHY (N = 13 focus groups; N = 84 RHY). Data were analyzed using a systematic content analysis approach that was both theory-driven and inductive, comparing higher to lower quality settings. We found all settings provided vital services and experienced challenges, but higher quality settings ameliorated challenges through (1) a youth-centered program philosophy equally understood by staff and RHY; (2) developmentally appropriate relationships between staff and RHY that promoted autonomy; (3) a focus on short- and long-term goals within anticipated crises; and (4) ongoing internal quality assessment procedures. Within lower quality settings we found (1) difficulties retaining effective staff and (2) a primary focus on basic services and managing crises, but less attention to emotional support, exacerbated by (3) funding and other challenges emerging from the larger environment.

“My Brother Was His Little Angel; I Was the Problem Child”: Perceived Sibling Favoritism in the Narratives of Youth Who Become Homeless,"Buccieri, K.","Youth who become homeless often report having difficult home lives, but very little is known about their experiences with siblings and parents. This article reports on a qualitative study of eight youth, aged 17 to 23 years, experiencing homelessness in Toronto. Seven of the youth felt that their parent(s) favored a sibling over them, leading to the construction of a good child–problem child dichotomy in the household. The perceived disfavoritism resulted in increased family conflict that sometimes escalated to physical violence. As a result of the perceived disfavoritism, all the youth had strained, or nonexistent, relationships with their parent(s); identification of parental disfavoritism as a theme may, with further investigation, be considered a newly identified pathway to the street.

Social and psychological resources among homeless youth: protection against risk for physical victimization?,"Tyler, K.A.; Schmitz, R.M.; Ray, C.M.","This study examines child physical abuse, social and psychological resources, and street physical victimization among 150 homeless youth from the Midwest. Path analyses results show that males have higher self-efficacy than females, while older youth and those who experienced less child physical abuse reported higher self-esteem. Self-efficacy and self-esteem were positively associated with social support as was being younger and having experienced less child physical abuse. Younger respondents reported fewer difficulties obtaining basic necessities, and those who had less trouble finding these necessities experienced less street physical victimization. Females, younger youth, and those who experienced less child physical abuse reported lower rates of physical victimization. Agencies should be aware that many youth experiencing homelessness have trouble obtaining basic necessities, which increases risk for victimization. Moreover, the ability to obtain necessities appears to override the influential role of social support, further affirming the foundational importance of agencies helping youth meet their basic needs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,J.

Results: Approximately 20% of participants reported past-month NMUPD. Almost 9% reported misusing prescription opioids, 8.7% misused prescription sedatives, and 6% misused prescription stimulants. Multivariable logistic regressions revealed unmet mental health needs were associated with sedative and stimulant misuse but not opioid misuse. Having suicidal thoughts was associated with opioid misuse but not sedative or stimulant misuse. Although no geographical differences emerged for stimulant and sedative misuse, youth from Denver, Phoenix, and San Jose were more likely to engage in opioid misuse relative to youth in Los Angeles. Conclusions: These findings indicate that interventions designed to address NMUPD need to be multifaceted, designed to address other risk behaviors correlated with NMUPD, and target unmet mental health needs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,200,,153-160,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.015,,#2244,Barman-Adhikari 2019,,
“They’re Always Complicated but That’s the Meaning of Family in My Eyes”: Homeless Youth Making Sense of “Family” and Family Relationships,"Parker, S.; Mayock, P.","Analyses of the relevance of family for young people are more visible than previously within youth research. Nonetheless, understanding of the nature and meaning of family relationships for those who experience separation from their family, including homeless youth, is relatively weak. Based on selected findings from a qualitative longitudinal study, this article explores the meaning-making processes of homeless young people with explicit attention to the ways in which “family” is produced and (re)negotiated in their lives over time. Four themes are presented—family as reliable and supportive; family as interrupted and “broken”; family as fragile and elusive; and family as fluid and ambiguous—revealing the unfolding nature of young people’s constructions of family and family relationships. The enduring impact of separation, dislocation, and conflict on how young people “make sense” of familial experiences is discussed, and we conclude with the practice implications arising from the findings. © The Author(s) 2018.",2019,,J.

Cumulative adversity profiles among youth experiencing housing and parental care instability,"Crumé, H.J.; Nurius, P.S.; Fleming, C.M.","This study applies cumulative adversity and stress proliferation theories to examine risk and protective resource profiles of youth with three different levels of housing and parental care instability. Data derive from a state representative sample (n = 27,087) of school-based adolescent students. ANCOVA analyses identified significant differences in sociodemographic and psychosocial functioning variables for youth with 0, 1, or 2 forms of housing and parental care instability, with more deleterious functioning being observed among youth with greater levels of instability. Those experiencing either or both housing and parental care instability are more represented by males, sexual minorities, and youth of color; psychosocial risk and protective factors demonstrated consistent differences between instability groups. Dimensions of cumulative adversity operate with social marginalities (e.g., race, sexual minority status) relative to instability, with higher frequency of victimization, lower grades, diminished self-regulation capabilities and school engagement, weakened psychological health, and strained family and peer relationships. The paper discusses theorized mechanisms through which cumulative adversity conveys effects as well as implications for social work prevention and resilience-fostering strategies in schools and other youth-serving settings. © 2019",2019,,Child.

“I guess it would be a good shock”: A qualitative examination of homeless youths' diverse pregnancy attitudes,"Begun, S.; Frey, C.; Combs, K.M.; Torrie, M.","Research documents that homeless youth hold complex attitudes toward pregnancy that are often ambivalent or positive. Gaining further understanding of youths' diverse pregnancy attitudes is important, especially as most studies focus solely on heterosexual, cisgender-identified females. This knowledge gap fails to acknowledge that youth who identify as LGBTQ+ experience homelessness at higher rates than youth who identify as cisgender and heterosexual, and are equally if not more likely to experience pregnancy. This phenomenological study explored pregnancy attitudes among 30 homeless youth of various genders and sexual orientations. Participants fell into three groups (pro-pregnancy, ambivalent, and anti-pregnancy), and sub-themes emerged within each group. Five participants described pregnancy as clearly positive and something they actively would like to experience in their current lives. Pro-pregnancy themes included that pregnancy/parenting offered a path to a loving family, instrumental supports, and respect from others. Thirteen participants described ambivalent attitudes in which they did not currently want a pregnancy, but could see benefits. Themes for this group included that despite being a shock, and depending on the partner, a pregnancy could help them make positive changes. Twelve participants described anti-pregnancy attitudes in which pregnancy was viewed as clearly negative. Themes emerged around not being ready for parenting, and wanting to avoid being a stereotype, like their parents, or having their child enter foster care. Findings suggest that shame- and blame-free education on contraception, healthy relationships, pregnancy decision-making options, and parenting is urgently needed for youth of all identities, though subgroups have varying perspectives and needs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child.

“I run inside the buildings”: adolescents’ perceptions of physical health and nature in family homeless shelters,"Cronley, C.; Keaton, C.; Hopman, D.D.; Nelson, L.P.","This article reports results from two focus groups designed to understand perceptions of health and nature among adolescents living in emergency family shelters. Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, the authors conducted one focus group each at two emergency family shelters in a high-density suburb in the southern United States with a total of eight adolescents (ages 13–17; 100% African American; 3 males). The study followed the tenets of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) in question design, data collection, and analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: (1) you are what you eat (2) healthy food is not always an option (3) physical activity makes you healthy, but it’s hard in a shelter and (4) nature is an abstract ideal. The adolescents expressed a desire to lead healthy lives but were stymied by the built environment; they described nature in idyllic terms but rarely reported engaging in outdoor leisure activities. Findings offer preliminary evidence supporting the need to provide adolescents in family shelters with enhanced access to outdoor physical activity opportunities and fresh foods. Results also highlight the importance of future research into how the built environment contributes to physical and mental health disparities among adolescents in high poverty situations such as homelessness. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,J.

"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) use and transitions to injection drug use among street-involved youth","Lake, S.; Gaddis, A.; Tupper, K.W.; Nosova, E.; DeBeck, K.","Background: Despite the popularity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) among young people across North America and Europe, MDMA is rarely explored in studies of young people at high risk of injecting drugs. We conducted a study among street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, to understand if use of MDMA is associated with initiation of injection drugs. Methods: We followed injection-naïve participants in the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), an ongoing prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14–26 who use illicit drugs. Bivariate and multivariate extended Cox models with time-updated variables were used to examine the association between MDMA use and initiation of injection drug use between September 2005 and May 2015. Results: Among 483 youth, 306 (63.4%) had a history of MDMA use and 218 (45.1%) had used MDMA in the previous 6 months at baseline. A total of 105 (21.7%) youth initiated injection drug use over the 10-year period, yielding an incidence density of 8.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.96–10.30) per 100 person-years. MDMA use was not significantly associated with initiating injection drugs at the bivariate (hazard ratio: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.61–1.42) or multivariate (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.57–1.35) level, after adjusting for socio-demographic and substance use confounders. Conclusions: Amid ongoing frequent use of MDMA among some young people in North America, we did not observe an elevated risk of injection initiation among those who used MDMA in this cohort of street-involved youth. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,Subst.

Youth homelessness and the racial knowledge gap,"Carrasco, A.R.","We know relatively little about homeless youth of color. Despite comprising almost three-quarters of the homeless youth population in the United States, youth of color, along with their unique needs, experiences, and wellbeing, have seldom been the subject of sustained and critical empirical inquiry. For example, in the context of education, the ways in which grade point averages, frequency of school change, and graduation rates may differ between homeless youth in general and homeless youth of color remain unknown. Even if we were to take the liberty of extending the existing comparative research regarding general student performance, the best we can surmise is that homeless youth of color fare worse according to all of these traditional success standards, but we haven’t the faintest idea how much worse or why. When it comes to vital questions about the wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable children in America, we are, at worst, asleep at the wheel and, at best, stumbling in the dark. On its surface, the “racial knowledge gap” appears to be a yawning expanse of missing information enveloped by a hazy mist of imprecise data interpretation, the meaning and significance of which I expound upon in this brief. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,J.

"Between resignation, resistance and recognition: A qualitative analysis of LGBTQ+ youth profiles of homelessness agencies utilization","Côté, P.-B.; Blais, M.","Despite the overrepresentation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) youth in the context of homelessness, little information is available on their utilization of homelessness agencies. Using a qualitative approach, this study aimed to identify homelessness agency use profiles among LGBTQ+ youth. Individual interviews were conducted with seventeen LGBTQ+ youths aged 17 to 25 years experiencing homelessness. Three profiles were identified: 1) resigning oneself to using homelessness agencies to meet basic needs and assure one's survival despite potential heteronormative and cisnormative victimization; 2) resisting homelessness agencies to protect oneself from heteronormative and cisnormative victimization; and 3) having a positive experience marked by feelings of acceptance and recognition within homelessness agencies. These results highlight the importance of rethinking institutional policies in homelessness organizations to eliminate heteronormative and cisnormative biases and to foster the harmonious inclusion and integration of LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child.

Examining patterns of cognitive impairment among homeless and precariously housed urban youth,"Barone, C.; Yamamoto, A.; Richardson, C.G.; Zivanovic, R.; Lin, D.; Mathias, S.","Introduction: Homeless and precariously housed young people are a complex, vulnerable population frequently perceived as being difficult to engage in health and social services. Although unrecognized deficits in cognitive functioning may adversely affect their ability to access assistance and meaningfully participate in programming, few researchers have examined these deficits. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of global and domain-specific cognitive impairment of street involved young people. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted using intake data from 494 clients (64% male; average age of 21 years) enrolled in a community-based inner city mental health program in Vancouver, Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to examine performance on six cognitive domains for a subsample (N = 44) referred for neuropsychological evaluation and bivariate statistics were used to compare youth who were and were not referred. Results: Cognitive impairment was evident in 80% of referred clients, with the most frequent difficulties involving attention and processing speed. Approximately 51% of clients referred for testing did not have more than a grade ten education and only 5% received government support for those with significant disabilities. Apart from alcohol use disorder, no significant differences were identified on sociodemographic and mental health variables between groups of referred and non-referred clients. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment was found in 80% of the young people referred for neuropsychological evaluation. This level of impairment combined with high levels of early school exiting and low levels of government support highlight the need for targeted screening to facilitate early identification and intervention. © 2019",2019,,J.

Sexual Health Services for Homeless Youth: A Qualitative Analysis of their Experiences,"Côté, P.-B.","The sexual health problems experienced by homeless youth bring into question their use of available sexual health services. Using a qualitative typological analysis, this study aims to identify sexual health services utilization profiles for homeless youth, and to understand the role of the homeless experience on the utilization of sexual health services. Individual interviews were conducted with 33 homeless youth (17 men, 16 women) between 18 and 25 years of age. Typological analysis identified four profiles: (1) a targeted use of sexual health services to determine one’s serological status following a relational change during the homeless experience; (2) a limited use of sexual health services to manage sexual emergencies that arise during the homeless experience; (3) a regular use of sexual health services to avoid the risks associated with the homeless experience; (4) a frequent use of sexual health services to obtain support when engaging in prostitution during the homeless experience. This study shows that the precarious and unstable conditions within the homeless experience incite youth to utilize sexual health services in different ways. These findings point to the importance of rethinking sexual health services to better adapt them to the different utilization profiles of homeless youth. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,J.

Youth homelessness and housing stability: What outcomes should we be looking for?,"Gaetz, S.; Ward, A.; Kimura, L.","In North America, the key performance indicator of success in community strategies to address homelessness is whether a homeless person is housed or not. In this article, we argue that for young people experiencing homelessness, we need to advance a broader consideration of outcomes to include a range of well-being indicators designed to understand the needs of developing adolescents and young adults and contribute to housing stability. We articulate that the positive outcomes of young people across life domains that include housing stability as well as their safety and security, health and well-being, social connections to peers, family and meaningful adults, connections to groups/neighbourhoods/communities, interests and recreation and leisure, and school and career/work aspirations and goals must be at the centre of these efforts.

The stepped care intervention to suppress viral load in youth living with HIV: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Arnold, E.M.; Swendeman, D.; Harris, D.; Fournier, J.; Kozina, L.; Abdalian, S.; Rotheram, M.J.","Background: Among youth living with HIV (YLH) aged 12-24 years who have health care in the United States, only 30% to 40% are virally suppressed. YLH must achieve viral suppression in order to reduce the probability of infecting others as well as increasing the length and quality of their own life. Objective: This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Standard Care condition (n=110) compared to an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention condition (n=110) to increase viral suppression among YLH aged 12-24 years with established infection (not acutely infected). Methods: YLH (N=220) who are not virally suppressed will be identified at homeless shelters, health clinics, and gay-identified community-based organizations in Los Angeles, CA, and New Orleans, LA. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. YLH will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions: Enhanced Standard Care, which includes standard clinical care plus an automated messaging and monitoring intervention (AMMI), or an Enhanced Stepped Care, which includes three levels of intervention (AMMI, Peer Support via social media plus AMMI, or Coaching plus Peer Support and AMMI). The primary outcome is viral suppression of HIV, and YLH will be assessed at 4-month intervals for 24 months. For the Enhanced Stepped Care intervention group, those who do not achieve viral suppression (via blood draw, viral load<200 copies/mL) at any 4-month assessment will “step up” to the next level of intervention. Secondary outcomes will be retention in care, antiretroviral therapy adherence, alcohol use, substance use, sexual behavior, and mental health symptoms. Results: Recruitment for this study began in June 2017 and is ongoing. We estimate data collection to be completed by the end of 2020. Conclusions: This is the first known application of an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention model for YLH. By providing the lowest level of intervention needed to achieve viral suppression, this model has the potential to be a cost-effective method of helping YLH achieve viral suppression and improve their quality of life. © Elizabeth Mayfield Arnold, Dallas Swendeman, Danielle Harris, Jasmine Fournier, Leslie Kozina, Susan Abdalian, Mary Jane Rotheram, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network CARES Team.",2019,,JMIR Res.

These youths face many barriers to receiving traditional mental health services, and as a result, only a few youths experiencing homelessness receive any form of mental health care. Objective: This project aimed to develop and determine the feasibility and acceptability of engaging young adults (ie, individuals aged 18-24 years) experiencing homelessness in a remotely delivered mental health intervention. This intervention provided brief emotional support and coping skills, drawing from cognitive behavioral principles as an introduction into psychosocial support. The intervention was piloted in a homeless shelter network. Methods: A total of 35 young adults experiencing homelessness participated in a single-arm feasibility pilot trial. Participants received a mobile phone, a service and data plan, and 1 month of support from a coach consisting of up to 3 brief phone sessions, text messaging, and mobile mental health apps. We evaluated feasibility by looking at completion of sessions as well as the overall program and acceptability with satisfaction ratings. We also collected clinical symptoms at baseline and the end of the 1-month support period. We used validity items to identify participants who might be responding inappropriately and thus only report satisfaction ratings and clinical outcomes from valid responses. Results: Most participants (20/35, 57%) completed all 3 of their phone sessions, with an average of 2.09 sessions (SD 1.22) completed by each participant. Participants sent an average of 15.06 text messages (SD 12.62) and received an average of 19.34 messages (SD 12.70). We found higher rates of satisfaction among the participants with valid responses, with 100% (23/23) of such participants indicating that they would recommend participation to someone else and 52% (12/23) reporting that they were very or extremely satisfied with their participation. We found very little change from pre- to posttreatment on measures of depression (d=0.27), post-traumatic stress disorder (d=0.17), and emotion regulation (d=0.10). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that it was feasible to engage homeless young adults in mental health services in this technology-based intervention with high rates of satisfaction. We did not find changes in clinical outcomes; however, we had a small sample size and a brief intervention. Technology might be an important avenue to reach young adults experiencing homelessness, but additional work could explore proper interventions to deliver with such a platform. © 2017, JMIR Publications.

How to help homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and substance use disorders? The creation of a new intensive outreach intervention team,"Doré-Gauthier, V.; Côté, H.; Jutras-Aswad, D.; Ouellet-Plamondon, C.; Abdel-Baki, A.","In Canada, about 6,000 youth are homeless every night, many of whom suffer from addiction and psychotic disorders. To facilitate the exit out of homelessness, access to care and to improve psychosis and addiction outcomes, a new intensive outreach intervention team (EQIIP SOL) was created in Montreal (2012). It offers intensive outreach services dedicated to homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and addiction (HYFEPA) in addition to an early psychosis intervention service (EIS) in collaboration with the Addiction Psychiatry Unit. Our aim is to describe the characteristics, clinical, functional and housing outcomes of HYFEPA followed by EQIIP SOL. This two years long prospective longitudinal study with all HYFEPA (n = 42) admitted to EQIIP SOL between 2012–2015 reports at multiple time points, clinical (CGI, GAF), functional (SOFAS, work/study, housing autonomy) and substance use disorder (DUS, AUS) outcomes and acute services use (hospitalizations, emergency room visits). We observed that, at baseline, HYFEPA showed poor prognostic factors (eg. cluster B personality, substance use disorders, legal problems, childhood trauma and lower education level). The majority reached housing stability after 6 months and their functioning and illness severity improved with time. This suggests that HYFEPA improve with an intensive outreach intervention team integrated to an EIS. © 2019",2019,,Psychiatry Res.,273,,603-612,,10.1016/j.psychres.2019.01.076,,#2276,Doré-Gauthier 2019,,
“It seems kinda like a different language to us”: Homeless youths’ attitudes and experiences pertaining to condoms and contraceptives,"Begun, S.; Combs, K.M.; Torrie, M.; Bender, K.","Homeless youth become pregnant or involved in pregnancies at high rates. There are many ways by which unintended pregnancies may be prevented, including the use of condoms and other contraceptives. However, there is a dearth of research regarding contraceptive use among this vulnerable youth population, and especially through lenses that consider homeless youths’ diverse gender identities, expressions, and sexualities. This study qualitatively explores homeless youths’ attitudes and experiences regarding condom and other contraceptive use. Data were obtained from interviews with 30 youth experiencing homelessness, ages 18–21. Youth reported inconsistent use of condoms and other contraceptives, which youth often attributed to their perceptions of contraceptive inaccessibility and exorbitant cost. Most youth also did not know where to obtain contraceptive information and services, and reported transportation barriers and fear of being stigmatized in health care settings, particularly in relation to their gender identities and sexualities. Findings suggest that reproductive and sexual health information and services are urgently needed by all homeless young people, and from low-barrier, non-judgmental, and empathetic sources. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",2019,,Soc.

Methods: A general questionnaire was applied to 75 children via a face-to-face interview. Body weight and height were measured and body mass index was calculated. Children were distributed according to the height for age and weight for height by using WHO 2007 reference criteria. Results: The majority of the children were boys. Approximately half of the children were attending primary school. Incidence of working on the street was higher in 10-12 age groups. It was seen that 37.3% of the children working on the street were having 2 main meals, while 56.0% were having 3; that the 72.0% of them were skipping meals. The nutritional status of children did not seem satisfactory, since none of them gained suficient energy and nutrients intakes. The distribution of height-for-age showed that 12.0% of the children were stunted. More than half of the children were normal weight; while 36.0% of them were overweight.

An Ecological Analysis of Risk Factors for Runaway Behavior among Individuals Exposed to Commercial Sexual Exploitation,"Fedina, L.; Perdue, T.; Bright, C.L.; Williamson, C.","Running away from home is a known risk factor for commercial sexual exploitation among youth; however, research has not fully investigated the process by which multiple factors at individual, familial, and extra-familial levels increase youths’ risk for runaway behavior. This study applies an ecological risk factor framework to assess risk for runaway behavior among individuals exposed to commercial sexual exploitation and examines mediating relationships between salient risk factors (i.e. substance abuse, insufficient basic needs, having a much older boyfriend/girlfriend) and runaway behavior. A cross-sectional, retrospective survey was administered to individuals involved in the commercial sex industry using Respondent Driven Sampling methods (N = 273). Bivariate results suggested associations between runaway behavior and childhood emotional and physical abuse, having friends who sold sex, having a much older boyfriend/girlfriend, dropping out of school, being worried about where to eat/sleep, homelessness, and frequent alcohol and drug use prior to entering the commercial sex industry. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that individuals with runaway behavior histories were more likely to have frequently used alcohol and/or drugs and to have insufficient basic needs compared to those did not run away; however, these factors were no longer significant after accounting for having a much older boyfriend/girlfriend. Having an older boyfriend/girlfriend fully mediated the relationship between frequent alcohol and/or drug use and runaway behavior. Findings support the need for community and school-based prevention programs that target these risk factors with a specific focus on healthy dating relationships, which may reduce risk for runaway behavior and subsequent commercial sexual exploitation. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,,J.

This study retrospectively examines associations between multiple risk factors and domestic child sex trafficking (i.e., entry into the commercial sex industry under the age of 18) in a sample of individuals aged 16 and older currently involved in the commercial sex industry (N = 273). Two primary research questions are addressed: (1) What set of risk factors, prior to entering the commercial sex industry, are associated with domestic child sex trafficking and (2) what group differences, if any, exist in risk factors between current or former domestic child sex–trafficking victims and non-trafficked adults engaged in the commercial sex industry? A cross-sectional survey was administered using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) in five cities in one Midwestern state. Overall, 115 participants (48.3%) were identified as current or former domestic child sex–trafficking victims. Bivariate results suggest that childhood emotional and sexual abuse, rape, ever running away from home, having family members in sex work, and having friends who purchased sex were significantly associated with domestic child sex trafficking. Multivariate results indicate that domestic child sex trafficking victims were significantly more likely to have ever run away and to be a racial/ethnic minority than non-trafficked adults engaged in the commercial sex industry. Findings can inform state-level policies on human trafficking and assist child protection and juvenile justice agencies in developing prevention and intervention responses to commercial sexual exploitation. © The Author(s) 2016.",2019,,J.

Peculiarities of educational and psychological support for victimized adolescents inclined to vagrancy,"Andronnikova, O.O.","Introduction. The author investigates the problem of vagrancy and running away from home among minors. The purpose of the research is to reveal the characteristic features of educational and psychological support for victimized adolescents inclined to vagrancy. Materials and Methods. A review of the scientific literature and analysis of statistics on the problem of vagrancy and home runaways among minors revealed the need to study the current state of this issue. The methodology of the research is based on the scientific conception of activity of the individual as a subject of life. The solution of research problems is implemented through an interdisciplinary approach. The study involved 190 adolescents aged between 14 and 16 years, 93 of whom were inclined to vagrancy. Applied empirical methods allowed to conduct a comprehensive study of adolescents' psychological characteristics and behavior. Results. The author studied subjective causes of vagrancy and ways how adolescents dealt with homeless and runaway episodes. The research revealed personality traits of adolescents inclined to vagrancy, characteristics of their motivation, values, self-esteem, self-attitude, and attitudes towards significant individuals, objects and situations, determined by homeless and runaway experience. The author identified unaccompanied homeless youth's characteristics of social and emotional intelligence, behavioral style, and specific response to stressful situations. The identified set of personal and behavioral characteristics of adolescents inclined to vagrancy was considered as a guideline for planning and implementing psychological preventative and remedial work with them. The author described educational conditions contributing to creating beneficial learning environments for adolescents inclined to vagrancy. Conclusions. It is shown that psychological remedial work with minors inclined to runaways and vagrancy is effective if it is based on peculiarities of personality structure and deviant behaviours of adolescents. © 2011-2019 Science for Education Today (Previous name: NSPU Bulletin)",2019,,Sci.

"Improving mental health services for homeless youth in downtown Montreal, Canada: Partnership between a local network and ACCESS Esprits ouverts (Open Minds), a National Services Transformation Research Initiative","Abdel-Baki, A.; Aubin, D.; Morisseau-Guillot, R.; Lal, S.; Dupont, M.-È.; Bauco, P.; Shah, J.L.; Joober, R.; Boksa, P.; Malla, A.; Iyer, S.N.","Aim: In many parts of the world, there is growing concern about youth homelessness. Homeless youth are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress, substance use and mental disorders, and premature mortality caused by suicide and drug overdose. However, their access to and use of mental health care is very limited. Methods: The Réseau d'intervention de proximité auprès des jeunes (RIPAJ), a Montreal network of over 20 community stakeholders providing a wide array of cohesive services, was created to ease homeless youth's access to mental health and psychosocial services. Its philosophy is that there should be no “wrong door” or “wrong timing” for youth seeking help. In 2014, the network partnered with the pan-Canadian transformational research initiative, ACCESS Esprits ouverts. Results: Created through this partnership, ACCESS Esprits ouverts RIPAJ has been promoting early identification through outreach activities targeting homeless youth and agencies that serve them. An ACCESS Clinician was hired to promote and rapidly respond to help-seeking and referrals. By strengthening connections within RIPAJ and using system navigation, the site is working to facilitate youth's access to timely appropriate care and eliminate age-based transitions between services. A notable feature of our program, that is not usually evident in homelessness services, has been the engagement of the youth in service planning and design and the encouragement of contact with families and/or friends. Conclusion: Challenges remain including eliminating any remaining age-related transitions of care between adolescent and adult services; and the sustainability of services transformation and network coordination. Nonetheless, this program serves as an example of an innovative, much-needed, community-oriented model for improving access to mental health care for homeless youth. © 2019 The Authors Early Intervention in Psychiatry Published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2019,,Early Intervent.

Utilization and Perceptions of Drop-in Center Services Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Parast, L.; Tucker, J.S.; Pedersen, E.R.; Klein, D.","Drop-in centers offer a range of services to assist unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness, but little is known about their perceptions of drop-in centers or use of different services. A random sample of 273 youth experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area who had ever used a drop-in center was surveyed. Most youth heard about local drop-in centers from peers (65.1%). They generally reported positive perceptions of the drop-in center environment, staff, and clients; overall, 57.8% were “very” or “extremely” satisfied with the services they had received. Nearly all youth cited basic services (e.g., food, showers, clothes) as a reason they went to drop-in centers; far fewer reported going to obtain higher-level services (e.g., case management). Perceptions and utilization did not differ by sexual orientation; however, non-white youth were more likely than Whites to use drop-in centers for certain higher-level services. Strategies for engaging youth in drop-in center services are discussed. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.",2019,,J.

Knowledge and Attitudes About Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Among Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness in Seven U.S. Cities,"Santa Maria, D.; Flash, C.A.; Narendorf, S.; Barman-Adhikari, A.; Petering, R.; Hsu, H.-T.; Shelton, J.; Bender, K.; Ferguson, K.","Purpose: Evidence suggests that young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at elevated risk of HIV compared to housed youth. Given the limited research on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness among YEH, this study examined their PrEP knowledge and attitudes. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional survey among YEH (ages 18–26) (n = 1,427) in seven U.S. cities were used to assess their knowledge and attitudes regarding PrEP to inform HIV prevention efforts. Results: Participants were primarily male youth of color. The mean age was 20.9years. While 66% felt at risk for HIV, only 14% strongly agreed that they try to protect themselves from getting infected with HIV. Most (84%) were eligible for PrEP based on risk, yet only 29% had knowledge of PrEP. Despite this, 59% reported they were likely/extremely likely to take PrEP. Access to free PrEP (55%), HIV testing (72%), healthcare (68%), and one-on-one (62%), and text messaging support (57%) were rated as very/extremely important for PrEP uptake and adherence. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest missed opportunities to prevent new HIV infections among YEH. Efforts to increase PrEP uptake among this population should consider provider- and system-level interventions to increase PrEP awareness, decrease PrEP-associated healthcare costs, improve access to PrEP providers, and provide in-person and text messaging support. © 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2019,,J.

Improving Access to Trauma-Informed Adoption Services: Applying a Developmental Trauma Framework,"Hartinger-Saunders, R.M.; Jones, A.S.; Rittner, B.","Foster and adopted children often experience multiple traumatic and adverse experiences. A growing body of literature indicates the negative impact of trauma on developmental milestones and brain development, which supports the need to address complex trauma among this vulnerable population of foster and adopted youth. This paper presents an overview of the unique needs of children adopted from the foster care system from the perspective of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), complex trauma, and developmental trauma disorder (DTD). There is an increasing number of evidence-based trauma-focused services and interventions for children and youth. However, many adoptive parents have limited trauma-informed training and limited access to trauma-informed and adoption-competent professionals, particularly long-term supports across developmental stages, making them ill-prepared to meet the needs of children in their care. This paper contributes to the understanding of how access to these trauma-focused services can be increased through new technologies, to better prepare and empower adoptive parents to deal effectively with difficult adoption issues when they arise and to improve outcomes for children and youth adopted from the public child welfare system. Several innovative approaches toward this end include harnessing technology to: (1) improve access to suitable adoption resources, (2) improve mechanisms to track critical events, behaviors, emotions, functional abilities, strengths, etc., in order to determine timely, on-demand contextual services, and (3) extend professional, supportive environments beyond the adoptive family context by proposing the use of technology to build interdisciplinary, virtual community partners. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.",2019,,J.

Circumstances of substance use by street youth in Egypt support the case for intervening to prevent adverse childhood experiences,"Amr, S.; Garas, M.; Boulos, D.N.K.; Saleh, D.A.; Jillson, I.A.; Loffredo, C.A.","Background: Egyptian street youth use substances including tobacco, illicit drugs, and pharmaceutical drugs. To understand the circumstances, including adverse childhood experiences, that place adolescents at risk for engaging in substance use, we conducted in-depth interviews among a sample of Egyptian street children. Methods: From youth residing at or attending Caritas, a non-profit organization, which provides shelter and education to street youth, seven girls and twelve boys, aged 12–18 years, participated in open-ended, in-depth interviews. Results: Eight out of the 19 participants reported family history (early exposure) to substance use; and seven of them were initiated by either a family member (sibling), friend or coworker. Most of the participants reported a history of conflict with or abuse (verbal or physical) by their parents or siblings, or stressful situations at home; they used substance(s) to alleviate their stress. Few attended school, and some were forced to work and help their family. Conclusions: Among Egyptian youth, adverse childhood experiences, such as poverty, child abuse, and family substance use, challenge somewhat susceptible youths and lead them to the path of substance use and addiction. Prevention intervention should be multifaceted, culturally adaptable, and primarily targeting the social environment during childhood. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,J. Subst.

Homelessness among youth who identify as LGBTQ+: A systematic review,"McCann, E.; Brown, M.","Aims and objectives: To explore homelessness among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning plus (LGBTQ+) youth and to identify their support and care requirements. Background: LGBTQ+ youth face many health and societal challenges including issues related to homelessness. Design: A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies. Methods: A search of relevant electronic databases was carried out and included the dates August 2008–August 2018 and limited to academic journals and peer-reviewed empirical studies written in English. Included studies specifically addressed the homeless experiences of youth aged 13–24 years old who identified as LGBTQ+. The PRISMA checklist was used in the review. A quality assessment instrument was used to review all of the selected papers and narrative methods utilised in the synthesis of the research evidence. Results: The search resulted in 319 papers, and after applying distinct inclusion criteria, a total of 14 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Following analysis, the four main themes identified were stigma, discrimination and exclusion; mental health issues and substance use; sexual risks and vulnerability; and interventions and supports. Conclusion: LGBTQ+ homeless youth is a major public health concern that has significant consequences for a young person's physical and psychosocial well-being. Relevance to clinical practice: Practitioners need to be aware of the specific health and support requirements of LGBTQ+ youth in relation to homelessness. Inclusive and holistic care plans should exist that are fully responsive to the distinct needs of this group guided by definitive policies and sound clinical research.

"A nurse practitioner-led intervention for runaway adolescents who have been sexually assaulted or sexually exploited: Effects on trauma symptoms, suicidality, and self-injury","Bounds, D.T.; Edinburgh, L.D.; Fogg, L.F.; Saeywc, E.M.","Background: Adolescent victims of sexual assault and exploitation suffer significant mental health distress including PTSD, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and attempts. Objective: This longitudinal observational study investigated the Runaway Intervention Program's influence on trauma responses at 3, 6, and 12 months for adolescents who have run away at least once and have been sexually assaulted or exploited. Participants: Runaways (n = 362) received nurse practitioner (NP) home and community visits, intensive case management, and optional empowerment groups. Setting: An urban Midwestern city's hospital-based Children's Advocacy Center. Methods: Trauma responses were measured by the UCLA PTSD-RI index, past 30 days emotional distress scale, and self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt questions. Repeated Measures ANOVA assessed trauma response changes over time. Growth curve analyses using intervention doses determined which aspects of the intervention predicted change. Results: From program entry to 3 and 6 months, mean values decreased significantly for emotional distress (−0.67, −.91) self-harm (−.30, −.55), suicidal ideation (−.45, −.57), suicide attempts (−.58, −.61), and trauma symptoms (−11.8, −16.2, all p <.001) all maintained at 12 months. In growth curve models, NP visits independently predicted declines in emotional distress (−.038), self-injury (−.020), suicidal ideation (−.025) and attempts (−.032), while empowerment groups predicted trauma symptoms (−.525) and all others except suicide attempts. Conclusions: The program, especially NP community visits and empowerment group elements, decreased trauma responses in runaway youth with a history of sexual assault. Given high rates of PTSD and emotional distress among runaways, the Runaway Intervention Program offers promise for improving mental health outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child Abuse Negl.,90,,99-107,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.01.023,,#2310,Bounds 2019,,
Child welfare characteristics in a sample of youth involved in commercial sex: An exploratory study,"Greeson, J.K.P.; Treglia, D.; Wolfe, D.S.; Wasch, S.; Gelles, R.J.","Background: Homeless, runaway, and youth exiting foster care are vulnerable to sexual exploitation, but little research has parsed the societal, community, and individual factors that contribute to their risk. Objectives: (1) To estimate child welfare characteristics in a sample of homeless young people who engaged in commercial sex (CS); and (2) To compare young people who were sex trafficked (ST) to those who engaged in some other form of CS. Participants and setting: This study includes 98 homeless young people in Philadelphia, PA, Phoenix, AZ, and Washington, DC, who were interviewed for a larger study of ST and endorsed engagement in CS. Methods: We used a non-probability, purposive, maximum variation sampling procedure. Interviews were recorded and responses were simultaneously noted on a standardized interview form. Data were analyzed through means, frequencies, and bivariate tests of association. Results: Average age of the full sample of 98 homeless young people was 20.9 years; 48% were female and 50% were Black/African American. Forty-six percent of the full sample was sex trafficked. The full sample and the victims of ST differed significantly in three child welfare characteristics, with the ST group more likely to have been maltreated as children, more likely to have had family involvement with the child welfare system (CWS), and more likely to report higher rates of living someplace other than with their biological parents as children. Conclusions: ST victims differ from those who engaged in other forms of CS in histories of maltreatment, involvement with the CWS, and exposure to residential instability while growing up. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child Abuse Negl.,94,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104038,,#2316,Greeson 2019,,

We used a cross-sectional mixed-methods study to explore PrEP knowledge, interest, facilitators, and barriers among YEH. Young adults were recruited from agencies serving YEH in Houston, TX (n = 30) and Los Angeles, CA (n = 15) to participate in an electronic self-report survey and a semistructured interview. Survey results indicate that 68.2% of YEH had low or no prior knowledge of PrEP, though 63.7% reported interest in taking PrEP. Qualitative results revealed facilitators of PrEP use, including high PrEP acceptability and awareness, and supportive social networks. Several barriers emerged, including medication-related barriers, adherence, cost, access barriers, low perceived HIV risk, perceived stigma of PrEP use, and low PrEP awareness. Despite high PrEP acceptability, PrEP use among YEH remains low partly due to low PrEP awareness, low perceived HIV risk, and medical mistrust. © 2019 The Guilford Press.",2019,,AIDS Educ.

Repeat missing child reports in Wales,"Hutchings, E.; Browne, K.D.; Chou, S.; Wade, K.","Background: There were approximately 306,000 reports of missing persons in the UK from 2012 to 2013, 64% involved children. Repeat missing incidents account for approximately 38% of reported missing incidences. Within their research Biehal et al. (2003) identified that 70% of missing children had voluntarily left their home and the majority of these were considered to have 'run away'. Research suggests that there is heavy demand on public services in responding to children that are regularly reported missing. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore data recorded in respect of children reported missing as a result of running away. The main objective of this study was to develop a set of risk factors to predict repeat missing incidences using a logistic regression method. Participants and setting: This study explored the characteristics of 523 children who were reported missing to Gwent (Wales) Police as a result of running away. Methods: Using data collected by the Gwent Missing Children's Team in Wales, over a one-year period, this study compared two groups of children: 275 (53%) who were reported missing once ('low risk') and 248 (47%) who were reported more than once ('high risk'). Results: Results indicated that five significant risk factors identified by logistic regression could distinguish outcome in 73% of cases. The five risk factors were; looked after children, substance use, suspected sexual exploitation, known to Youth Offending Services and a history of abuse/neglect. Conclusions: These risk factors could potentially be used in Gwent to guide intervention strategies, with those children identified as 'high risk' of repeat missing incidents requiring more comprehensive intervention and support. © 2018",2019,,Child Abuse Negl.,88,,107-117,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.11.004,,#2329,Hutchings 2019,,
Measurements of Vulnerability to Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: A Systematic Review,"McCoy, M.","Domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) is one type of human trafficking, in which a minor American citizen or resident alien is commercially sexually exploited within United States borders. One of the areas of DMST inquiry that may benefit from additional attention are the domains of vulnerability and risk. The risk factors that are often named in the literature as predictive of DMST include youth runaway status, homelessness, involvement with the child welfare system, belonging to a sexual or racial minority group, and a history of child physical or sexual abuse. However, none of these named factors has yet achieved predictive validity in the literature, and the field appears confused about how to position and validate these hypothesized risk factors into a DMST vulnerability measurement tool. Within the present systematic review, a search for relevant publications occurred within numerous databases. A full text review of the articles that met inclusion criteria revealed that none of the empirical articles within the sampling frame utilized a validated measurement of DMST vulnerability. The articles, however, provided insight into the associations between risk factors and DMST victimization. The results of this review fill a sizable gap in the literature by assessing available publications for an operationalization of youth vulnerability to DMST. The review concludes with recommendations for the next steps that are required for the development and implementation of a DMST vulnerability measurement tool with predictive validity. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2019,,J.

Street-involved youth engaged in sex work at increased risk of syringe sharing,"Bozinoff, N.; Luo, L.; Dong, H.; Krüsi, A.; DeBeck, K.","Syringe sharing places street-involved young people at risk of acquiring HIV and hepatitis C. While markers of economic marginalization, such as homelessness, have been linked with syringe sharing and have led to targeted interventions, the relationship between syringe sharing and other markers of economic vulnerability, such as sex work, are not well documented among young people. This study examines whether those engaged in sex work are at increased risk of syringe borrowing and syringe lending among street-involved youth who use injection drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Between September 2005 and May 2014, data was collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street involved youth aged 14–26. Generalized estimating equations with a confounding model building approach was used to examine the relationship between sex work and syringe borrowing and lending. 498 youth reported injecting drugs at some point during the study period and were therefore included in the analysis. In multivariable analysis, youth who engaged in sex work were at an elevated risk of both syringe borrowing (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.17, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.40–3.36) and syringe lending (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.07–2.59). Our study found that youth engaged in street-based sex work were at a significantly higher risk of both syringe borrowing and lending among youth who use injection drugs in Vancouver. Ready access to clean syringes, safer working conditions for sex workers to enable risk reduction measures, and increased access to addiction treatment are identified as promising opportunities for reducing syringe sharing in this setting. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,AIDS Care Psychol.

"Understanding pathways between PTSD, homelessness, and substance use among adolescents","Davis, J.P.; Diguiseppi, G.; De Leon, J.; Prindle, J.; Sedano, A.; Rivera, D.; Henwood, B.; Rice, E.","Youth experiencing homelessness have been shown to experience high levels of both trauma and substance use. However, prior work has yet to consider how substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and homelessness are temporally, or reciprocally, associated over time. The current study uses symptom-driven and experience-driven models to examine the reciprocal relationships between substance use, PTSD symptoms, and homelessness among a large sample of adolescents receiving substance use treatment in the United States. Adolescents (n = 20,069; Mage = 15.6; 74% male) completed baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month assessments. Autoregressive latent trajectory with structured residual (ALT-SR) models were used to examine within- and between-person relationships. We found continued support for prior work at the between-person level of analysis. At the within-person level, during the treatment phase, PTSD emerged as a key mechanism predicting both return to use and increased days of homelessness posttreatment. Further, greater substance use at treatment completion was associated with greater PTSD symptoms and homelessness, prospectively. The current study extends the previous work to consider individual level processes in conjunction with overarching event level predictors of homelessness. We found that PTSD symptomology is a driving factor that influences, both directly and indirectly, experiences of homelessness posttreatment. Interventions may wish to incorporate trauma informed approaches for youth entering treatment as this may mitigate long-term experiences of homelessness and return to substance use. © 2018 American Psychological Association.",2019,,Psychol.

"Risk Versus Resiliency: Addressing Depression in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth","Johnson, B.; Leibowitz, S.; Chavez, A.; Herbert, S.E.","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)youth have unique risk factors that predispose them to depression at higher rates than their non-LGBT peers. Family rejection, bullying, and lack of societal acceptance can contribute to negative health outcomes. Additionally, youth with gender dysphoria may need or benefit from medical interventions. LGBT youth also have the same risk factors as non-LGBT youth, requiring clinicians to decipher risk factors associated with sexual and gender minority identity status, general risk factors, and relationships among them. Assessment of these risk factors and implementation of targeted interventions are important when treating depression in LGBT youth. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,,Child Adolesc. Psychiatr. Clin.

"Awareness and utilization of female condoms among street youths in ibadan, an urban setting in south-west Nigeria","Uchendu, O.C.; Adeyera, O.; Owoaje, E.T.","Introduction: female condom awareness and use have been poorly documented in sub-Saharan region especially among street youths. This study assessed its awareness and use among street youths. Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted among 964 youths between ages 15 to 24 years old using questionnaires to elicit information. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted at 5% level of significance. Results: more than half (69.9%) were males and between 20-25 years of age (61.2%). More than three-quarter (81.0%) had initiated sexual activity. Almost half (47.9%) of the respondents have heard about female condoms however only 16.8% have ever seen while 4.3% have actually ever used a female condom. Age, education, current sexual activity and experience of rape attempt were predictors of female condom awareness. Conclusion: awareness of female condom was a significant predictor of utilization of female condoms. There is therefore a need for proper awareness and education on the effectiveness of female condoms. © Obioma Chukwudi Uchendu et al.",2019,,Pan Afr. Med.

Characteristics of Mothers and Infants Living in Homeless Shelters and Public Housing in New York City,"Reilly, K.H.; Zimmerman, R.; Huynh, M.; Kennedy, J.; McVeigh, K.H.","Introduction Homelessness can result in poor health. The number of families with children living in NYC homeless shelters increased 55% from 2008 to 2014. Half of children living in shelter in 2014 were younger than 6 years old. We compared demographics and health outcomes of mothers and infants residing in NYC homeless shelters to those residing in public housing in this cross-sectional study. Methods Addresses of NYC Department of Homeless Services shelters and NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments were matched to NYC Department of Health birth certificate data for the years 2008–2013. Sociodemographic and health characteristics of newborns residing in shelters were compared to newborns in NYCHA housing using Chi square tests. Results Mothers residing in shelters were younger, more likely to be black and less likely to be Hispanic, more likely to have been born outside NYC and reside in the Bronx. Babies born to mothers living in shelter were more likely to have low birth weight (< 2500 g), be born preterm (< 37 gestational weeks), require assisted ventilation immediately following delivery, have a NICU admission, and use Medicaid. They were less likely to breastfeed within 5 days of delivery and be discharged to their residence. Discussion Homeless mothers and infants had poorer health outcomes compared with those living in public housing. Understanding the health disparities of homeless infants can provide guidance for developing future policies and research initiatives, which may be used to inform the development of new policies to improve health outcomes of homeless infants and their mothers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,Matern.

Identifying sexual and labor exploitation among sheltered youth experiencing homelessness: A comparison of screening methods,"Mostajabian, S.; Santa Maria, D.; Wiemann, C.; Newlin, E.; Bocchini, C.","Human trafficking is a significant and growing public health concern. Subgroups of adolescents and young adults are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, especially youth who are unstably housed or homeless. While youth experiencing trafficking come into contact with the healthcare system, they are often not identified during routine assessment due to lack of specific inquiry and low disclosure. Therefore, we utilized a mixed-methods study design to assess the differences in the identification of human trafficking among youth experiencing homelessness (n = 129) between a standard psychosocial assessment tool and a human trafficking specific assessment tool. Findings indicate that the tool developed to specifically assess for human trafficking was more likely to identify youth experiencing sexual and labor exploitation, as well as the risk factors for human trafficking. Secondly, youth reported that mistrust of the system, fear of involving the police if reported, not wanting to interact with the mental healthcare system, and stigma are barriers to disclosing human trafficking. In conclusion, healthcare providers caring for youth experiencing homelessness should adopt improved screening tools for human trafficking to reduce the risk of missed opportunities for prevention and treatment among this high-risk population of youth. © 2019 by the authors.

Promising approaches for engaging youth and young adults living with hiv in hiv primary care using social media and mobile technology interventions: Protocol for the spns social media initiative,"Medich, M.; Swendeman, D.T.; Comulada, W.S.; Kao, U.H.; Myers, J.J.; Brooks, R.A.; Donohoe, T.J.; Johnson, A.; Reback, C.J.; Kisler, K.; Keglovitz-Baker, K.; Cordova, R.; Avery, A.; Step, M.; Smith, C.A.; Thompson, M.; Zurlo, J.; Du, P.; Dowshen, N.L.; Koenig, H.; Wilson, E.C.; Arayasirikul, S.; Rhodes, S.D.; Tanner, A.E.; Plax, K.; Glotfelty, J.","Background: In the United States, disparities in the rates of HIV care among youth and young adults result from the intersections of factors that include stigma, substance use, homelessness or marginal housing, institutional neglect, and mental health issues. Novel interventions are needed that are geared to youth and young adults. Objective: In this paper, we aim to describe the interventions used by participating sites for Using Social Media initiative, the process for classifying the intervention components, and the methods for conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the interventions. Methods: In 2015, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau, Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) funded the Evaluation and Technical Assistance Center (ETAC) at the University of California, Los Angeles and 10 demonstration projects at sites across the United States that incorporated innovative approaches using a variety of social media and mobile technology strategies designed specifically for youth and young adults living with HIV. The ETAC developed a typology, or a classification system, that systematically summarizes the principal components of the interventions into broader groups and developed a multisite, mixed-methods approach to evaluate them based on the Department of Health and Human Services HIV health outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The mixed-methods approach is key to remove potential biases in assessing the effectiveness of demonstration projects. Results: This SPNS project was funded in September 2015, and enrollment was completed on May 31, 2018. A total of 984 participants have been enrolled in the multisite evaluation. Data collection will continue until August 2019. However, data analysis is currently underway, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2019. Conclusions: This HRSA-funded initiative seeks to increase engagement in HIV medical care, improve health outcomes for people living with HIV, and reduce HIV-related health disparities and health inequities that affect HIV-positive youth and young adults. © Melissa Medich, Dallas T Swendeman, W Scott Comulada, Uyen H Kao, Janet J Myers, Ronald A Brooks, Special Projects of National Significance Social Media Initiative Study Group.",2019,,JMIR Res.

"Perceived Devaluation among a Cohort of Street-Involved Youth in Vancouver, Canada","Karamouzian, M.; Cheng, T.; Nosova, E.; Sedgemore, K.; Shoveller, J.; Kerr, T.; Debeck, K.","Background: Perceived devaluation is a barrier to seeking mental and physical health services among people who use illicit drugs. Objective: Assessing the prevalence and correlates of perceived devaluation within a cohort of street-involved youth. Methods: Data were drawn from an open prospective cohort of street-involved youth who use illicit drugs (aged 14–26 at study enrollment) between December 2013 and May 2015 in Vancouver, Canada. Perceived devaluation was measured using an adapted version of Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination scale. Multivariable generalized estimating equations were constructed to examine factors independently associated with high perceived devaluation. Results: Among 411 street-involved youth, 95.1% reported high perceived devaluation at some point during the study period. In a multivariable analysis, youth who reported high perceived devaluation were significantly more likely to engage in: unprotected sex (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.56, 95% Confidence Interval 1.03–2.37); heavy alcohol use (AOR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.22–4.36); and daily heroin use (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.16–3.70). Youth who resided in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood were significantly less likely to report high perceived devaluation (AOR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.26–0.65). Conclusions: Perceived devaluation was extremely prevalent among street-involved youth in our sample. We also observed that youth most in need of health and social services were significantly more likely to report high levels of perceived devaluation which may result in a reluctance to seek out key services and supports. These findings highlight the need to implement stigma reduction interventions for vulnerable youth in this setting. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2019,,Subst.

Participants were 57% male, 38% female, 4% transgender, and 1% other. The average age of participants was 20.7 years (SD = 2.0 years). The majority of the participants were African American (56%), followed by white (14%) and multiracial (14%). The Human Trafficking Interview and Assessment Measure detected that nearly one in five young people were victims of sex trafficking, either due to force, fraud, or coercion (FFC); age; or both. Those who were sex trafficked were more likely than those who were not sex trafficked to be female, sexual minorities, or Latino and to have either dropped out of high school or obtained a GED. Differences between being trafficked due to FFC and being trafficked due to age were also investigated.

Health care equity and access for marginalised young people: A longitudinal qualitative study exploring health system navigation in Australia,"Robards, F.; Kang, M.; Steinbeck, K.; Hawke, C.; Jan, S.; Sanci, L.; Liew, Y.Y.; Kong, M.; Usherwood, T.","Background: Young people have unique social, emotional and developmental needs that require a welcoming and responsive health system, and policies that support their access to health care. Those who are socially or culturally marginalised may face additional challenges in navigating health care, contributing to health inequity. The aim of this study was to understand health system navigation, including the role of technology, for young people belonging to one or more marginalised groups, in order to inform youth health policy in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: This qualitative longitudinal study involved 2-4 interviews each over 6 to 12 months with marginalised young people aged 12-24 years living in NSW. The analysis used Nvivo software and grounded theory. Results: We interviewed 41 young people at baseline who were living in rural or remote areas, sexuality and/or gender diverse, refugee, homeless, and/or Aboriginal. A retention rate of over 85% was achieved. Nineteen belonged to more than one marginalised group allowing an exploration of intersectionality. General practitioners (family physicians) were the most commonly accessed service throughout the study period. Participants were ambivalent about their healthcare journeys. Qualitative analysis identified five themes: 1. Technology brings opportunities to understand, connect and engage with services 2. Healthcare journeys are shaped by decisions weighing up convenience, engagement, effectiveness and affordability. 3. Marginalised young people perceive and experience multiple forms of discrimination leading to forgone care. 4. Multiple marginalisation makes health system navigation more challenging 5. The impact of health system complexity and fragmentation may be mitigated by system knowledge and navigation support Conclusions: The compounding effects of multiple discrimination and access barriers were experienced more strongly for young people belonging to mutiple marginalised groups. We identify several areas for improving clinical practice and policy. Integrating technology and social media into processes that facilitate access and navigation, providing respectful and welcoming services that recognise diversity, improving health literacy and involving professionals in advocacy and navigation support may help to address these issues. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,,Int.

Four youth served as co-investigators and cultural informants for the project. The team conducted focus groups (N = 22; ages 16–22) and in-depth interviews (N = 20; ages 18–24) with homeless youth to explore decisions about condomless sex, knowledge of STIs and HIV, health-care access for STI-related services, and perceptions about STI testing. Findings revealed that homeless youth have good general knowledge about STIs, are receptive to STI testing for themselves and their sexual partners, and have heightened concerns about being HIV positive and peers knowing their STI status. Results from the current study could contribute to the development of youth-informed tailored interventions to increase protective sexual behavior, reduce health disparities, and improve access to and the quality of health-care services for homeless youth. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",2019,,Compr.

The social dimensions of gambling among street youth in Mumbai: Is it really an addiction?,"Saldanha, K.; Madangopal, D.","This mixed-methods, exploratory study investigates the gambling activities of street youth in Mumbai, India. Data from surveys and brief interviews of 70 youth aged 12–24, two focus groups, and ethnographic observations offer descriptive snapshots of the gambling behavior of participants. The article includes details about games played, popular venues, initiation patterns, time spent gambling, and interactions with the police. Street youth gamble for social benefits, such as group membership and fun; it is also a leisure activity enabling time to go by quickly. Individual benefits include intermittent rewards and a high after winning or being referred to as a gambler. The inability to save, the lack of recreation options, living in groups, and the environment of the streets structure and sustain gambling. This study discusses the group and social dimension of gambling among street youth, and how this dimension makes their participation different from adolescent gambling in general and General Addictions Theory. It contributes to the literature by emphasizing that for street youth the social/group aspects of gambling predominate the psychological. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for practice, highlighting the need to develop recreational, income-saving, and educational awareness programs. © The Author(s) 2017.",2019,,Qual.

Transitioning Out of Foster Care: The First 12 Months,"Rome, S.H.; Raskin, M.","Youth aging out of foster care are at particular risk for negative outcomes including school dropout, homelessness, poverty, unemployment, substance abuse, health and mental health problems, and victimization. Yet we know little about how, when, and why these youth find themselves on a downward trajectory. This qualitative, phenomenological study—conducted in partnership with four public child welfare agencies—examined the lived experience of 19 youth during their first year after exiting foster care. The authors used monthly, contemporaneous interviews to explore domains including housing, employment, education, and relationships with trusted adults. Although outcomes in employment were poorest, participants’ experience in all domains was characterized by frequent changes and instability. Adverse events began immediately and many youth were unsure how to navigate the system to get help. Yet youth who were successful in one domain were more likely to be successful in others. Risk factors included having four or more foster care placements, being on probation, accumulating fines, and losing government assistance. Protective factors included living with an adult who shares the rent and maintains a positive, consistent presence; being a full-time student; receiving educational and housing subsidies; having reliable means of transportation and communication; and maintaining the same job throughout the transitional year. Despite facing significant obstacles, the youth demonstrated resilience and optimism as they contemplated their futures. Recommendations include providing specialized services that target youth as they exit the system, and emphasizing stability rather than self-sufficiency. © The Author(s) 2017.",2019,,Youth Soc.,51,4,529-547,,10.1177/0044118X17694968,,#2375,Rome 2019,,
More than just a seat at the table: the power of youth voice in ending youth homelessness in the United States,"Schoenfeld, E.A.; Bennett, K.; Manganella, K.; Kemp, G.","Each year, over 600 youth under the age of 25 experience literal homelessness in Austin, Texas. Of these youth, 76% have a history of involvement with foster care or the juvenile justice system—far exceeding the rates of system involvement observed among homeless youth in other large communities in the United States (approximately 54%; Voices of Youth Count, 2017). Recently, Austin was selected by the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development as one of ten communities nationwide to participate in the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP), a federal initiative designed to effectively end youth homelessness by 2020. Youth with lived experience are central players in the development and implementation of Austin's response to the youth homelessness crisis. A group of twelve of these youth (the “Austin Youth Collective to End Youth Homelessness,” or AYC) serve as key decision-making partners within the Austin YHDP team. Representatives of the AYC are deeply involved at every level of the community planning process, from the development of youth-centric housing options to system redesign efforts to ensure that youth do not exit the foster care or juvenile justice systems to homelessness.

“They give you back that dignity”: understanding the intangible resources that make a transitional house a home for homeless families,"Fleary, S.A.; Joseph, P.; Zhang, E.; Quirion, C.","Approximately 33% of the homeless population in 2017 were families with children. Researchers have argued for interventions and services to employ an ecological perspective to mitigate some of the unintentional harm inherent in existing programs designed to serve homeless families. This paper utilized a case study of a transitional housing program to (1) determine how well the program met recommendations informed by the ecological perspective and (2) explore underlying themes across recommendations. Past and current residents of a transitional housing program participated in semi-structured interviews as part of a program evaluation. Interviews were deductively and inductively coded to meet aims 1 and 2, respectively. Residents identified several aspects of the program that met the ecological perspective recommendations including culturally-responsive services, trauma-based services, and social and community connections. Major underlying themes spanning across recommendations included interpersonal resources (caring, sense of belonging), empowerment resources (advocacy, family preservation), impact on family (family life, positive youth development), and communication. This case study, through the analysis of residents’ perspectives, highlights the important role of transitional housing programs in providing a supportive, empathetic, empowering, and home-like environment that gives residents “back that dignity” so they are emotionally and physically prepared to successfully transition to permanent housing. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,J.

"Homelessness and incarceration associated with relapse into stimulant and opioid use among youth who are street-involved in Vancouver, Canada","Goldman-Hasbun, J.; Nosova, E.; Kerr, T.; Wood, E.; DeBeck, K.","Introduction and Aims: While much research has sought to identify the factors associated with initiation and cessation of various forms of drug use among vulnerable youth, little is known about relapse into drug use in this population. We sought to characterise relapse into stimulant and opioid use among street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Design and Methods: Data were collected between 2005 and 2017 from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver. Multivariable extended Cox regression was utilised to identify factors associated with relapse into illegal stimulants and/or opioids among youth who had previously ceased using stimulants and/or opioids for 6 months or longer. Results: Among 246 participants who reported a period of cessation lasting 6 months or longer, 165 (67.1%) relapsed at some point during study follow-up. Youth who were recently incarcerated (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.46), homeless (AHR: 1.43), or had a history of daily stimulant use (AHR: 1.48) were significantly more likely to report relapse, while youth of who identified as white (AHR: 0.74) were significantly less likely to report relapse (all P < 0.05). Discussion and Conclusions: Relapse into stimulants and/or opioids was common among youth in our setting, and incarceration, homelessness, and daily stimulant use were found to be positively associated with relapse among youth. Findings suggest that increased access to youth housing supports and alternatives to the criminalisation of drug use may help to reduce the rates of relapse into stimulants and/or opioids in this population. © 2019 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs",2019,,Drug Alcohol Rev.,38,4,428-434,,10.1111/dar.12921,,#2379,Goldman-Hasbun 2019,,

Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging Microenterprise for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) is a feasibility randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention with integrated text messages (""nudges"") that are informed by behavioral economic principles. The trial aims to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. Methods/design: In total, 40 young adults who are African-American, aged 18-24, live in Baltimore City, have experienced at least one episode of homelessness in the last 12 months, are unemployed or underemployed (fewer than 10 h per week), are not enrolled in school, own a cell phone with text messaging, and report at least one episode of unprotected or unsafe sex in the prior 12 months will be recruited from two community-based organizations providing residential supportive services to urban youth. Participants will undergo a 3-week run-in period and thereafter be randomly assigned to one of two groups with active interventions for 20 weeks. The first group (""comparison"") will receive text messages with information on job openings. The second group (""experimental"") will receive text messages with information on job openings plus information on HIV prevention and business educational sessions, a mentored apprenticeship, and a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages based on principles from behavioral economics. The two primary outcomes relate to the feasibility of conducting a larger trial. Secondary outcomes relate to employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive practices. All participants will be assessed using an in-person questionnaire at pre-intervention (prior to randomization) and at 3 weeks post-intervention. To obtain repeated, longitudinal measures, participants will be assessed weekly using text message surveys from pre-intervention up to 3 weeks post-intervention. Discussion: This study will be one of the first U.S.-based feasibility randomized clinical trials of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults.

Effects of individual risk and state housing factors on adverse outcomes in a national sample of youth transitioning out of foster care,"Prince, D.M.; Vidal, S.; Okpych, N.; Connell, C.M.","Introduction: Compared to their peers, youth who leave the foster care system without permanency experience greater risks for adverse young adult outcomes, including homelessness, incarceration, substance abuse, and early child birth. Extant literature focuses on individual-level factors related to adversity. In this study, we estimated the impact of state and individual-level risk and protective factors on adverse 19-year-old outcomes among a cohort of U.S. transition age youth. Methods: We used multilevel modeling to analyze prospective, longitudinal data from two waves of the National Youth in Transitions Database (N = 7449). These data were linked to the Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System, the Administration for Children and Families budget expenditures, and the American Community Survey for the period from 2011 to 2013. Results: Approximately 30% of the variation in each of the 19-year-old outcomes could be attributed to state-level effects. Residence in a state that spent above average of CFCIP budget on housing supports reduced the risk of homelessness and incarceration. Living in a state with a higher proportion of housing-burdened low-income renters significantly increased the risk of substance abuse and child birth. Individual-level risks were significant: racial/ethnic minority, male gender, past risk history, placement instability, child behavioral problems, residence in group home or runaway. Remaining in foster care at age 19 reduced the odds of homelessness, incarceration, and substance abuse. Conclusion: Macro factors, including financial support for transition-age youth, and broader housing market characteristics, have a bearing on young adult outcomes, and raise policy questions across social and human service sectors. © 2019",2019,,J.

Although homeless youth are considered resilient, sparse literature exists on factors that promote resilience in this vulnerable group. Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 purposively selected homeless children and youth (with a mean age of 14 years) from the Central Business District of Accra, Ghana. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings showed that a strong religious belief, sense of humour, engagement in meaningful social interactive activities, reciprocal friendship, adherence to cultural norms and support from community-based organizations were identified as factors that help homeless youth cope with the multiple challenges of street life. Strengthening such protective factors could help ameliorate the impact of adverse conditions of these street youth. © 2019 by the author.",2019,,Behavioral Sciences,9,6,,,10.3390/bs9060064,,#2395,Asante 2019,,

"Child abuse, mental health and sleeping arrangements among homeless youth: Links to physical and sexual street victimization","Tyler, K.A.; Schmitz, R.M.","Physical safety is a primary concern among homeless youth because they struggle to secure basic necessities and a permanent place to live. Despite this, studies have not fully examined the numerous linkages that might explain risk for victimization within the context of material insecurity. In this study, we examine multiple levels of both proximal and distal risk factors at the individual (e.g. mental health), family (e.g. child abuse), and environmental levels (e.g. finding necessities) and their associations with physical and sexual street victimization among 150 Midwestern homeless youth. Results from path analyses show that child physical abuse is positively associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, locating necessities, and street physical victimization. Having difficulties finding basic necessities is positively correlated with street physical victimization. Experiencing child sexual abuse is positively associated with street sexual victimization. Additionally, sleeping at certain locations (e.g. violence shelter, in a car) is associated with less sexual street victimization compared to temporarily staying with a family member. These findings have implications for service providers working to improve the safety and well-being of homeless youth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child. Youth Serv.

"Predictors of Academic Success in 9- to 11-Year-Old Homeless Children: The Role of Executive Function, Social Competence, and Emotional Control","Lafavor, T.","Widening achievement gaps between homeless and highly mobile (HHM) youth and their peers highlight the need for research to understand effects of risk and adversity on development to promote resilience and positive adaptation. Youth living under the poverty line experience more risk and adversity, leading to difficulty in multiple domains including academic achievement. Effortful control has been established as a protective factor among young HHM children; however, the impact of other factors including social competence and emotional control on functioning in early adolescence remains less clear. The current study examined effortful control, social competence, and emotional control in adaptive processes in 86 children, aged 9 to 11, living in an emergency homeless shelter. Consistent with expectations, emotional control and social competence each contributed to academic achievement, above and beyond effortful control and IQ. Emotional control moderated effortful control on reading ability. Implications of these findings, including policy and practice, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2016.",2018,,J.

Drug use patterns and predictors among homeless youth: Results of an ecological momentary assessment,"Santa Maria, D.; Padhye, N.; Yang, Y.; Gallardo, K.; Santos, G.-M.; Jung, J.; Businelle, M.","Background. Alcohol and drug use is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is highly prevalent among homeless youth. Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) have been used to examine the effect of urges on drug use, though not among homeless youth. Objectives. We assessed the patterns of drug use and the correlation between real-time contextual factors and drug use using EMA collected daily. We identified predictors of drug use among a sample of homeless youth 18–25 years old in Houston, Texas. Methods. Homeless youth (n = 66, 62% male) were recruited from a drop-in center between September 2015 and May 2016. We used generalized linear mixed models and cross-validation methods to determine the best predictive model of drug use. Results. The overall drug use was high: 61% and 32% of participants reported using drugs or alcohol at least one day, respectively. Marijuana and synthetic marijuana use (i.e., Kush, K2, incense packs) were reported most frequently; 86% and 13% of the total drug use EMAs, respectfully. Drug use urge was reported on 26% of days and was the highest on drug use days. Drug use was predicted by discrimination, pornography use, alcohol use, and urges for drugs, alcohol, and to steal. Conclusions. EMA can be used to predict drug use among homeless youth. Drug use treatment among homeless youth should address the role of experiencing discrimination, pornography and alcohol use, and urge management strategies on drug use. Research is needed to determine if EMA informed just-in-time interventions targeting these predictors can reduce use. © 2018, © 2018 the Author(s).

A review of the national policies on street children in China,"Gao, Y.; Atkinson-Sheppard, S.; Yu, Y.; Xiong, G.","Global research related to street children has been conducted for over 30 years but in-depth research into policy approaches of individual countries and their response to street children is limited. The current research contributes to the literature by reviewing the Chinese national policies on street children, and referring to the international framework of policy approaches towards street children, identifies 3 policy approaches adopted by Chinese government: correctional and institutional, rehabilitation, and prevention. The research finds that the policy responses of the Chinese government towards street children vary with social development, and have shifted from the correctional and institutional approach under the custody and repatriation system (1982–2003) and rehabilitation approach under the new relief and management system (2003−2013) to the prevention approach after 2013. The article concludes by arguing that the Chinese government has adopted a prevention approach and is making progress in establishing a child social protection system to prevent the root causes of child homelessness. Suggestions are proposed for further strengthening the child protection system with a particular focus on prioritizing children's rights alongside child welfare. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

One-year outcomes of youth exiting a residential care facility in South Africa,"Dickens, L.","This article describes the 1-year outcomes of youth transitioning out of a residential care facility in South Africa. Those outcomes are compared with both national data on youth in the general population and care leavers from the United Kingdom. Analysis of the outcomes of 52 care leavers showed that they had fairly secure accommodation, low levels of homelessness, and low levels of criminal involvement and substance abuse. However, care leavers were particularly vulnerable in their educational attainment and employment outcomes and ran the risk of being not in employment, education or training. This has economic and psychological consequences for youth, who are then forced to rely on others for their livelihood and it can increase their feelings of depression, isolation, and despondency. Results from this study provide insight into the challenges and needs of young people transitioning out of residential care, which provides guidance on what to prioritize for practice. This research has implications not only for improving the understanding of care leaving in South Africa and Africa, but also for the existing knowledge based on research internationally. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2018,,Child Fam.

“Humbling experiences”: A photovoice project with sexual and gender-expansive youth experiencing homelessness,"Forge, N.; Lewinson, T.; Garner, B.M.; Braxton, C.; Greenwald, L.; Maley, O.","While experiencing homelessness, queer youth are subject to stereotyping, discrimination, and violence that affect their ability to achieve independent living and actualize goals. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ)-identified youth of color are at greater risk for homelessness when compared to heterosexual counterparts. This study explores lived experiences of queer-identified youth of color who are currently experiencing homelessness. Using photovoice methodology, a group of 4 participants drawn from an Atlanta-based service provider for LGBTQ youth were engaged in a series of focus groups to discuss meaningful photographic images and give voice to shared homelessness experiences. From their individual and collective narratives, three key themes were identified: becoming aware, managing inner struggles, and recognizing personal strengths. The participating youth marked the conclusion of the project by presenting to youth service practitioners a poster board display of photos that visually represented areas of concern and opportunities for ongoing advocacy to benefit this underserved and often misunderstood population. This study also reports on this poster board display and the outcomes identified by the participating young people for better supporting homeless LGBTQ young people. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2018,,J.

Retaining a sample of homeless youth,"Forchuk, C.; O’regan, T.; Jeng, M.; Wright, A.","Objective: Hard to reach populations need to be included in research studies to ensure proper representation of the general population. This paper explores tracking strategies used in the Youth Matters in London project to retain a sample of homeless youth. Method: A total of 187 youth, aged between 16 and 24 years, homeless or precariously housed, and experiencing a serious mental health issue were recruited at a community drop-in center, by word of mouth and by snowball sampling. After the initial interview, three repeat interviews were conducted six months apart. Results: The most successful strategy for contacting participants was through a local agency and e-mail. An analysis of the contact data identified participant retention rates as 88%, 86%, and 82% for each successive interview. This longitudinal retention rate is very high compared with research in other vulnerable populations, suggesting a strong willingness to participate in the Youth Matters in London project. Conclusions: Retaining a sample of homeless youth is difficult, however, with time, patience and effort it has proven possible. This research underscores the importance of relationships with community agencies to retain vulnerable youth samples in longitudinal research designs. © 2018, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Pediatric emergency department visits for homelessness after shelter eligibility policy change,"Stewart, A.M.; Kanak, M.M.; Gerald, A.M.; Kimia, A.A.; Landschaft, A.; Sandel, M.T.; Lee, L.K.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2012, Massachusetts changed its emergency shelter eligibility policy for homeless families. One new criterion to document homelessness was staying in a location ""not meant for human habitation, "" and the emergency department (ED) fulfilled this requirement. Our aim for this study is to analyze the frequency and costs of pediatric ED visits for homelessness before and after this policy. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of ED visits for homelessness at a children's hospital from March 2010 to February 2016. A natural language processing tool was used to identify cases, which were manually reviewed for inclusion. We compared demographic and homelessness circumstance characteristics and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to compare ED visits by homeless children before and after the policy. We compared the change in ED visits for homelessness to the number of homeless children in Massachusetts. We analyzed payment data for each visit. RESULTS: There were 312 ED visits for homelessness; 95% (n = 297) of visits were after the policy. These visits increased 4.5 times after the policy (95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 15.23). Children seen after the policy were more likely to have no medical complaint (rate ratio: 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 9.01). Although the number of homeless children in Massachusetts increased 1.4 times over the study period, ED visits for homelessness increased 13-fold. Payments (average: $557 per visit) were >4 times what a night in a shelter would cost; 89% of payments were made through state-based insurance plans. CONCLUSIONS: A policy change to Massachusetts' shelter eligibility was associated with increased pediatric ED visits for homelessness along with substantial health care costs. © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",2018,,Pediatrics,142,5,,,10.1542/peds.2018-1224,,#2411,Stewart 2018,,
Suicidal Ideation and Behavior among Youth Victims of Sex Trafficking in Kentuckiana,"Frey, L.M.; Middleton, J.; Gattis, M.N.; Fulginiti, A.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness are at risk for sex trafficking and mental health concerns. Aims: More information is needed to elucidate the prevalence and characteristics of suicidal ideation and behavior among youth experiencing sex trafficking. Method: The present study examined suicidal ideation and behavior in a convenience sample of 128 youths experiencing homelessness aged 12-25 years in metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky, and southern Indiana. Participants were asked seven questions regarding suicidal ideation and attempts as part of an enhanced version of the 60-item Youth Experiences Survey (YES). Results: Approximately 53% of the sample reported experiencing suicidal ideation at some point in their lifetime and the odds of a youth experiencing homelessness who had experienced sex trafficking reporting suicidal ideation was 3.87 times higher than the odds of a youth experiencing homelessness who had not experienced sex trafficking. Additionally, of those who reported experiencing suicidal ideation, the majority (84.4%) reported they had attempted suicide in their lifetime. Limitations: This study relied on a convenience sample of youth receiving services in the Kentuckiana region and brief, self-report measures yielding categorical data. Conclusion: Programs servicing youth experiencing homelessness should require additional training and resources regarding the identification, screening, and assessment of youth who are at risk of or who have experienced sex trafficking in order to more quickly connect youth with much-needed, trauma-informed services. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",2019,,Crisis,40,4,240-248,,10.1027/0227-5910/a000557,,#2413,Frey 2019,,
More than four walls and a roof needed: A complex tertiary prevention approach for recently homeless youth,"Kidd, S.A.; Vitopoulos, N.; Frederick, T.; Leon, S.; Karabanow, J.; McKenzie, K.","This article examines the feasibility of a complex intervention designed to facilitate the transition of youth out of homelessness. It is intended to contribute to efforts to build out the youth homelessness intervention literature, which is underdeveloped relative to descriptive characterizations of risk. The 6-month intervention examined here, referred to as the Housing Outreach Program Collaboration (HOP-C), is comprised of transitional outreach-based case management, individual and group mental health supports, and peer support. The intervention was delivered through a multiagency, interdisciplinary collaboration. Feasibility was assessed using a mixed methods design that included prepost intervention metrics and the study site was a large Canadian urban center. A total of 31 youth participated in the study with 28 completing the intervention. Overall, implementation and youth engagement was successful though patterns and intensity of engagement were quite variable. While prepost, self-report metrics improved modestly, substantial gains were observed in employment, education, and mental health service connectedness. Qualitative themes focused on the benefits of a flexible, multicomponent approach, close attention to seamless delivery and common factors, and supporting youth in the balance of isolation versus independence. These findings suggested that this tertiary prevention approach is feasible and warrants further investigation. © 2018 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.",2019,,Am. J.

Community perceptions of home environments that lead children & youth to the street in semi-rural Kenya,"Seidel, S.; Muciimi, J.; Chang, J.; Gitari, S.; Keiser, P.; Goodman, M.L.","Research with street-involved children and youth (SICY) in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past three decades has established a complex web of both micro and macro-level factors that simultaneously “push” and “pull” children and youth to the street. There is still little research with adult family and community members in communities from which SICY originate. Forty men and women from five semi-rural villages in Meru County, Kenya participated in a Rapid Rural Appraisal utilizing a fishbone diagram to explore main and underlying reasons for why children may be or may feel unwelcome in the home and thus migrate to the street. Responses were analyzed in terms of ecological levels, child or parent perspective, and the push/pull framework. Overall, community members identified families and households experiencing stress and lacking the necessary resources to successfully adjust and adapt. Four ecological levels of influence were proposed as main reasons, with parent and caregiver factors mentioned most often, followed by household factors, children's intrapersonal factors, and interpersonal (family) factors. Community and environmental level factors were also proposed as underlying factors. Analysis by gender revealed that both men and women emphasized push factors over pull factors, though men proposed more pull factors (from peers and street life) than women did. Men placed more responsibility on the children than women did, citing children's negative behaviors, dissatisfaction with home, and a desire for independence and work/income. Women, in contrast, emphasized children's feelings of being unloved and the experience of harsh punishment or abuse from caregivers. Findings suggest that interventions to reduce street involvement should support economically, medically, and psychologically vulnerable families and households through comprehensive family strengthening programs that build financial capacity, improve parenting and communication skills, and promote education over child work and labor. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child Abuse Negl.,82,,34-44,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.05.011,,#2420,Seidel 2018,,
Timing and duration of pre- and postnatal homelessness and the health of young children,"Sandel, M.; Sheward, R.; De Cuba, S.E.; Coleman, S.; Heeren, T.; Black, M.M.; Casey, P.H.; Chilton, M.; Cook, J.; Cutts, D.B.; Rose-Jacobs, R.; Frank, D.A.","OBJECTIVES: Prenatal homelessness is associated with elevated risks of adverse neonatal outcomes. How the timing and duration of homelessness during pregnancy and/or a child's early life relate to postnatal child health is unclear. METHODS: We interviewed 20 571 low-income caregivers of children <4 years old in urban pediatric clinics and/or emergency departments in 5 US cities. Categories of homelessness timing were prenatal, postnatal, both, or never; postnatal duration was >6 months or <6 months. RESULTS: After controlling for birth outcomes and other potential confounders, compared with never-homeless children, children who were homeless both pre- and postnatally were at the highest risk of the following: postneonatal hospitalizations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.41; confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.69), fair or poor child health (aOR 1.97; CI 1.58-2.47), and developmental delays (aOR 1.48; CI 1.16-1.89). There was no significant association with risk of underweight (aOR 0.95; CI 0.76-1.18) or overweight status (aOR 1.07; CI 0.84- 1.37). Children <1 year old with >6 months of homelessness versus those who were never homeless had high risks of fair or poor health (aOR 3.13; CI 2.05-4.79); children 1 to 4 years old who were homeless for >6 months were at risk for fair or poor health (aOR 1.89; CI 1.38-2.58). CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for birth outcomes, the stress of prenatal and postnatal homelessness was found to be associated with an increased risk of adverse pediatric health outcomes relative to those who were never homeless.

Does natural mentoring matter? A multilevel meta-analysis on the association between natural mentoring and youth outcomes,"Van Dam, L.; Smit, D.; Wildschut, B.; Branje, S.J.T.; Rhodes, J.E.; Assink, M.; Stams, G.J.J.M.","In this meta-analytic review, we examined the relation between natural mentoring and youth outcomes in four domains: academic and vocational functioning, socialemotional development, physical health, and psychosocial problems. Natural mentoring relationships are thought to foster positive youth development and buffer against the risks associated with the tumultuous years of adolescence. Two separate meta-analyses were conducted on the presence of a natural mentor and the quality of the natural mentoring relationship, including thirty studies from 1992 to present. The findings indicated that the presence of a natural mentor was significantly associated with positive youth outcomes (r =.106). A larger effect size was found for the quality of the natural mentoring relationship in terms of relatedness, social support, and autonomy support (r =.208). The largest effect sizes were found for socialemotional development and academic and vocational functioning. Risk-status (e.g., teenage mothers, homeless youth, youth in foster care, and youth of alcoholic parents) did not moderate the relation between presence and quality of natural mentoring relationships and youth outcomes, which may indicate that natural mentors are generally beneficial for all youth regardless of risk-status. Implications for theory and practice concerning the quality of the natural mentoring relationship are discussed. © 2018 The Authors.",2018,,Am. J.

Absent Inclusion Polices: Problems Facing Homeless Transgender Youth,"Sellers, M.D.","Transgender individuals make up a disproportionately high percentage of homeless youth. This is due to conflict with their family, harassment in schools, or negative interactions with child services. In addition to the typical needs of homeless youth, questions arise regarding housing, changing the youth’s name and gender, and access to healthcare. Analysis examines what protections and services subnational governments provide to homeless transgender youth as of 2016. The findings indicate that state and local governments provide most nondiscrimination protections for these youths, with local government outreach programs specializing services for homeless and transgender populations. It is more common for states not to have nondiscrimination policies for the lesbian; gay; bisexual; and transgender community. However, several states have extensive protections for transgender individuals to remove discriminatory practices that contribute to homelessness, such as in housing or foster care. Findings also show that more than 350 municipalities have policies that explicitly protect the transgender community. These policies typically ban discrimination in policy areas, like education and employment, but some local governments went beyond these basic protections to serve vulnerable populations better. Although few governments formally create policies to work with homeless and transgender populations, more than a quarter of governments offer testing and treatment for HIV. © 2018, Copyright © American Society for Public Administration.",2018,,Public Integr.,20,6,625-639,,10.1080/10999922.2018.1446629,,#2429,Sellers 2018,,
Identifying the ophthalmic needs of families living in Toronto shelters,"Sedarous, F.; Dimaras, H.; Isaac, M.; Lichter, M.; Tehrani, N.N.","Objective: To assess the ophthalmic needs of families with children residing in Toronto shelters. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Forty-nine families, including 86 children (age 0–16 years) and 55 adult and youth family members (AYFM) (age >16 years), randomly selected from 5 family shelters in Toronto, Ont. Methods: Ten families with at least 1 child aged 16 years or younger were randomly recruited from each shelter. Data on sociodemographics, medical history, ocular history, and access to eye care were collected through a structured interview. Eye examinations were performed in the shelters for all children and AYFM. Results: The mean age for AYFM was 34.9 ± 9.3 years (range, 17–60 years), and the mean age for children was 6.1 ± 4.3 years (range, 1 month–16 years). Thirty-nine percent of parents reported dissatisfaction with their vision, and 6.7% of children had parents who perceived that their child had eye problems. Overall, fewer parents had accessed care for their own eye problems in the last year than for their children (parents 36.4%, children 81.8%). Examination revealed abnormal ocular findings in 47.3% of AYFM and 24.4% of children. The commonest finding in AYFM was refractive error (30.9%); among children, it was refractive errors (16.3.%) and strabismus (3.5%). Conclusions: We found that a significant percentage of families living in shelters had eye problems that required treatment. We propose a proactive approach to identify these families and their dependent children in order to expedite access to appropriate eye care in a timely fashion for this vulnerable population. © 2018",2018,,Can.

Factors associated with drop-in center utilization among unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness,"Tucker, J.S.; Pedersen, E.R.; Parast, L.; Klein, D.J.","Purpose: Drop-in centers for homeless youth take a low barrier approach to addressing both their basic needs (e.g., food, hygiene, clothing) and higher level needs (e.g., substance use treatment, mental health care, HIV/STD-related programs). Prior studies indicate that youth who use drop-in centers show improvements in health-related behaviors over time. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with drop-in center attendance in this population. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a probability sample of 226 youth who were unaccompanied (not living with a parent or guardian) and experiencing homelessness (mean age = 21.58 years; 27% female, 43% non-Hispanic White) to examine associations between predisposing, enabling and need factors with any drop-in center attendance and frequency of attendance in the past 30 days. Results: Youth were more likely to have used a drop-in center if they reported hygiene-related needs (i.e., showers, clean clothes) and more positive perceptions of the drop-in center environment. Of youth who reported any drop-in center use, attendance was more frequent among those who also used shelter services, perceived that more of their friends used a drop-in center, knew staff who they could count on for support, and had a more avoidant attachment style within close relationships. Conclusions: The factors associated with any use of drop-in center services are distinct from those that may encourage homeless youth to use these services more frequently. Identifying these different set of factors can inform future outreach and intervention efforts to increase drop-in center utilization in this vulnerable population. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

Perceived Need and Receipt of Behavioral Health Services at Drop-In Centers among Homeless Youth,"Pedersen, E.R.; Tucker, J.S.; Klein, D.J.; Parast, L.","Objective: Homeless youth are a population in need of housing assistance and case management, as well as services to address behavioral health problems. This study examines youth's perceived need for and receipt of services through drop-in centers. Data Source: Surveys of 273 homeless youth. Study Design: Cross-sectional. Extraction Methods: Descriptive analyses with bivariate and multivariable regression models. Principal Findings: About one-third to half of the sample met criteria for behavioral health problems, yet half or less of those meeting criteria reported a need for services targeting the problems. Most youth who perceived a need for services received relevant services through a drop-in center, with the exception of care for substance use problems. Youth with behavioral health problems were more likely to perceive a need for services related to housing and case management than those addressing behavioral health problems more directly. Multivariable regression analyses indicated that the factors most strongly associated with perceived need for services were not behavioral health problems, but rather race/ethnicity, traveler status, trouble meeting basic needs, delinquency, abuse/victimization experiences, and trading sex. Conclusions: Findings can help to develop outreach and intervention efforts to reach homeless youth and help promote the use of behavioral health services. © Health Research and Educational Trust",2018,,Health Serv.

Psychological Interventions for Runaway and Homeless Youth,"Noh, D.","Purpose: In this review we examined previous studies of psychological interventions for runaway and homeless youth and evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of mental health outcomes. Design: Literature review. Methods: A search of various databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), was conducted. In this review we systematically described the characteristics of the included studies and interventions, and conducted a narrative synthesis and meta-analyses of the mental health outcomes of the interventions. Findings: Five types of psychological interventions were identified in the included 11 studies: art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions, family therapy, motivational interviewing, and strengths-based interventions. The narrative synthesis found positive effects of family therapy on substance use and positive effects of CBT-based interventions on depression. However, according to the meta-analyses, none of the interventions had any significant effects. Conclusions: Family therapies are likely to be effective in cases of substance use, and CBT-based interventions are likely to be effective in dealing with cases of depression. However, as the quantitative synthesis did not support the effects of any of the psychological interventions on mental health outcomes, further research is needed. Clinical Relevance: Nurse-led interventions were identified in two studies. Mental health nurses should assess the mental health status of runaway and homeless youth and provide timely and effective interventions. © 2018 Sigma Theta Tau International",2018,,J. Nurs.

Predictors of employment outcomes in a comprehensive service program for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness,"Brown, M.; Mihelicova, M.; Ponce, A.","Previous research indicates a positive link between youth runaway episodes and the likelihood of homelessness in later adolescence and early adulthood. An adolescent's decision to run away from home often accompanies depressive symptomology compared with stably housed youth. The present study used a large, nationally representative sample of 8,560 youth to identify links among runaway behavior, changes in depressive symptomology during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood, and homelessness. Results suggest that running away during adolescence is linked with later homelessness across depressive symptom classes. In fact, even a single runaway episode as a teenager tripled the odds of reporting homelessness by young adulthood. However, the magnitude of the association varies based on depressive symptom trajectories. Adolescents reporting high levels of depressive symptomology that increased over time were 6 times more likely to experience homelessness, compared with youth with consistently low depressive symptoms. Interestingly, among participants who reported never running away, this same high/increasing depressive symptoms group were less likely to report homelessness than were peers with consistently low depressive symptoms. These findings point to a potential resiliency process among youth in this category that needs to be further explored to identify differences in youth with poor mental health who leave home verses those who remain stably housed. © 2018 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.",2019,,Am.

Parents’ descriptions of young children’s dissociative reactions after trauma,"Cintron, G.; Salloum, A.; Blair-Andrews, Z.; Storch, E.A.","There is limited research on the phenomenology of how young children who have been exposed to trauma express the intrusive symptom of dissociative reactions. The current qualitative study utilized interviews from a semi-structured diagnostic clinical interview with 74 caregivers of young children (ages 3 to 7) who were exposed to trauma to identify parents’ descriptions of their children’s dissociative reactions during a clinical interview. Based on results from the interview, 45.9% of the children had dissociative reactions (8.5% had flashbacks and 41.9% had dissociative episodes). Interviews were transcribed to identify themes of dissociative reactions in young children. Common themes to flashbacks and dissociative episodes included being triggered, being psychologically in their own world (e.g., spaced out and shut down), and displaying visible signs (e.g., crying and screaming). For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was re-experiencing the trauma (e.g., yelling specific words and having body responses). For dissociative episodes, caregivers noted that the child not only seemed psychologically somewhere else (e.g., distant and not there) but also would be physically positioned somewhere else (e.g., sitting and not responding). Caregivers also expressed their own reactions to the child’s dissociative episode due to not understanding what was occurring, and trying to interrupt the occurrences (e.g., calling out to the child). Themes, descriptions, and phrases to describe dissociative reactions in young children after trauma can be used to help parents and professionals more accurately identify occurrences of dissociative reactions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",2018,,J.

Development of a complex tertiary prevention intervention for the transition out of youth homelessness,"Vitopoulos, N.A.; Frederick, T.J.; Leon, S.; Daley, M.; McDonald, C.; Morales, S.; Cerswell Kielburger, L.; Cohen, S.; Eacott, K.; Howes, C.; Gutierrez, R.; McGavin, K.; Peters, K.; Vanderheul, J.; McKenzie, K.; Kidd, S.A.","This paper describes the process of design, development, and implementation of a complex, multi-component, tertiary prevention intervention aimed at stabilizing pathways out of homelessness, the Housing Outreach Project-Collaborative (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multi-organizational, cross-sector, inter-professional collaboration. This process-oriented paper aims to elucidate the rationale for and experience of implementing the three main components of HOP-C: case management, mental health treatment and peer support, as well as the processes that support this wrap-around intervention as a whole. This paper draws on qualitative process-oriented data (i.e. field notes and interviews with staff) collected over the course of the intervention, and integrates perspectives from multiple practitioners involved in this endeavour. Practitioners reported the diversity in the type and intensity of services offered to clients, the building of a close and communicative interprofessional and inter-agency team, as well as the development of broader connectivity between organizations and practitioners as significant strengths of this approach. Challenges and successes in implementation are explored with the intention of providing insight into ways in which other collaborative complex interventions might be approached in the youth homelessness sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

Transgender and other gender-diverse youth's progression through the HIV continuum of care: Socioecological system barriers,"Harper, G.W.; Jadwin-Cakmak, L.A.; Popoff, E.; Campbell, B.A.; Granderson, R.; Wesp, L.M.","Transgender and other gender-diverse youth (TGDY) are disproportionately affected by HIV and in need of developmentally and culturally appropriate services as they progress along the HIV continuum of care (CoC). We conducted a phenomenological analysis of 66 in-depth interviews with TGDY living with HIV (ages 16-24) from 14 cities across the United States about their experiences within the different stages of the HIV CoC. TGDY described experiencing a wide variety of barriers across each examined stage of the HIV CoC, including HIV testing, linkage to care, retention in care, initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Within these CoC stages, TGDY experienced barriers to care across all socioecological systems, including the sociocultural systems, clinic/organizational systems, and interpersonal systems. Barrier themes remained relatively constant for all stages of the CoC, although the way each thematic category of barrier (e.g., the theme of societal oppression and discrimination within the sociocultural level) was experienced varied by stage. Although overall thematic categories were typically not focused solely on threats to participants' gender identity and expression, specific descriptions of the nature of the thematic barriers were related to gender identity and gender expression. Implications of the findings for future research and practice are discussed. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.",2019,,AIDS Patient Care STDs,33,1,32-43,,10.1089/apc.2018.0078,,#2450,Harper 2019,,
"Coping, Social Support, and Suicide Attempts among Homeless Adolescents","Gauvin, G.; Labelle, R.; Daigle, M.; Breton, J.-J.; Houle, J.","Background: Homeless youth are a population at risk for suicidal behavior. Despite growing knowledge about risk factors, protective factors against suicidal behavior among this population are still poorly understood. Aims: To explore differences in coping and social support between homeless adolescents who attempted suicide and those who did not. Method: In total, 76 homeless adolescents from eight different shelters provided information about their suicidal behaviors over the previous year and flled out coping and social support questionnaires. Results: Homeless adolescents who had not attempted suicide perceived more social support (tangible assistance and guidance). Conversely, youth who had attempted suicide reported using more nonproductive strategies of coping (tension reduction, keep to self, and self-blame). Tangible assistance and tension reduction were found to be the strongest predictors. Limitations: As most of these youth were not homeless for a long time, care should be taken in generalizing these results to adolescents with longer histories of homelessness. Conclusion: Productive coping does not seem to constitute a suffcient personal resource to protect homeless adolescents from suicide attempts. Nonproductive coping could, however, be considered a serious risk factor. Consequently, promoting homeless youths? ability to fnd environmental resources, especially tangible assistance, could be the most valuable approach. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",2019,,Crisis,40,6,390-399,,10.1027/0227-5910/a000579,,#2451,Gauvin 2019,,
Regular MDMA use is associated with decreased risk of drug injection among street-involved youth who use illicit drugs,"Gaddis, A.; Lake, S.; Tupper, K.; Nosova, E.; Blommaert, K.; Wood, E.; DeBeck, K.","Objectives: Childhood trauma is common among street-involved youth and is associated with injection drug use. Illicit 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is also common among street-involved youth, and data suggest this substance has clinical utility in management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated harms. Despite this, little is known about co-occurring patterns of MDMA use and injection drug use. Methods: Data were derived from a prospective cohort of street-involved youth using illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Using multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression, we examined the association between MDMA use and the use of injection drugs, adjusting for confounders such as polysubstance use and sociodemographic factors. Results: 4941 surveys from 1208 participants between September 2005 and May 2015 were included. Of these, 829 (68.6%) were male, 815 (67.5%) reported white ethnicity, and median age was 21.7 years. Overall, 599 (49.6%) participants reported MDMA use, 544 (45.0%) reported injection drug use, and 244 (20.2%) reported concurrent MDMA and injection drug use at least once during the study period. In multivariable analyses, regular MDMA use was significantly negatively associated with injection drug use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.46–0.69). Discussion: After accounting for socio-demographic factors and polysubstance use, periods of reported regular MDMA use were negatively associated with reported injection drug use among this cohort. These findings suggest that, unlike the use of most other non-injection drugs, illicit MDMA use does not appear to promote injection drug use but rather is associated with a reduced likelihood of injection drug use. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,,Drug Alcohol Depend.,192,,112-117,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.035,,#2454,Gaddis 2018,,
From empirical analysis to public policy: evaluating housing systems for homeless youth,"Chan, H.; Rice, E.; Vayanos, P.; Tambe, M.; Morton, M.","There are nearly 2 million homeless youth in the United States each year. Coordinated entry systems are being used to provide homeless youth with housing assistance across the nation. Despite these efforts, the number of youth still homeless or unstably housed remains very high. Motivated by this fact, we initiate a first study to understand and analyze the current governmental housing systems for homeless youth. In this paper, we aim to provide answers to the following questions: (1) What is the current governmental housing system for assigning homeless youth to different housing assistance? (2) Can we infer the current assignment guidelines of the local housing communities? (3) What is the result and outcome of the current assignment process? (4) Can we predict whether the youth will be homeless after receiving the housing assistance? To answer these questions, we first provide an overview of the current housing systems. Next, we use simple and interpretable machine learning tools to infer the decision rules of the local communities and evaluate the outcomes of such assignment. We then determine whether the vulnerability features/rubrics can be used to predict youth’s homelessness status after receiving housing assistance. Finally, we discuss the policy recommendations from our study for the local communities and the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11053 LNAI,,69-85,,10.1007/978-3-030-10997-4_5,,#2458,Chan 2019,,
"“School definitely failed me, the system failed me”: Identifying opportunities to impact educational outcomes for homeless and child welfare-involved youth","Semanchin Jones, A.; Bowen, E.; Ball, A.","Children and youth who experience homelessness and child welfare involvement may experience high mobility, disruption of relationships with family and peer networks, and social stigma, all of which can have a negative impact on educational success for these youth. In this study, we explored the perspective of youth who were involved with child welfare and homeless serving systems, and who had experienced school challenges. Youth (n = 20) between the ages of 18 and 24 participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Using a life course framework, we asked youth about their experiences in these multiple systems across developmental stages, and asked them to highlight what might have been helpful to their educational outcomes. Data analysis was conducted by a research team of three scholars who each had expertise in these varied systems, and member checking was completed with four youth to increase credibility of the findings. Results highlighted the importance of youth having supportive adults in their lives, suggesting an opportunity for systems to better mobilize and support caring adults, including informal supports and professional staff within these systems that can advocate for youth. Results also stress the importance of using a trauma-informed approach with cross- systems youth, rather than punitive approaches to discipline that tend to exacerbate negative educational outcomes. Many of these youth felt like they had to “make it on their own,” underscoring the need to better connect youth to existing resources within their communities and building on youths’ strengths and protective factors, in order to improve educational outcomes for vulnerable youth. © 2018",2018,,Child.

In our ongoing study, which is based on a Solomon four-group design with repeated measures, monitoring and training are essential to ensure intervention fidelity.

Evaluation of a community based dental clinic for youth experiencing homelessness in Brisbane,"Stormon, N.; Pateman, K.; Smith, P.; Callander, A.; Ford, P.J.","The relationship between homelessness and ill health is complex, and many risk factors for homelessness such as unemployment, low income, and substance abuse are also risk factors for poor oral health. In order to overcome barriers to access dental care, previous studies have recommended integrating dental care, referral pathways, and information within the overall care provided by support services available to people at risk of homelessness. This study aimed to evaluate a dental service developed and implemented to improve access to oral health care of disadvantaged youth in Brisbane. A mobile dental clinic run by volunteer dental professionals was implemented into a community organisation for disadvantaged youth. Participants were clients of Brisbane Youth Services who were disadvantaged youth, ≤25 years and attended the dental clinic in a 1 year period. A questionnaire collected demographic information, a self-assessment of oral health and an evaluation of their experiences with the dental clinic. Clinical data including DMFT, appointment attendance and items of service provided were collected. One hundred and twelve clients participated in the four dental clinic weeks and its evaluation. Cost was the greatest reported barrier to accessing dental care among participants. More than half (57%) of participants who pre-booked an appointment failed to attend. A total of 640 services were delivered, with an estimated value of $48,000. The majority (69%, n = 444) of the services provided were preventative services. Almost all of the clients felt the service they received was suitable for them (97%, n = 98) and would use the service again (98%, n = 99). This dental clinic model is feasible and sustainable due to its integration into an existing homeless youth service, low running costs, acceptability to clients and an interest by dental practitioners to volunteer. It provides a useful model which could be scaled up and implemented in other regions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2019,,Health Soc.

"A comparison of risk factors for various forms of trauma in the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual homeless youth","Tyler, K.A.; Schmitz, R.M.","Numerous homeless youth experience trauma prior to leaving home and while on the street. Bullying and trading sex (i.e. exchanging sexual favors for survival items such as food) are additional forms of trauma experienced by many homeless youth. Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth experience higher rates of child abuse compared to their heterosexual counterparts, there is a paucity of research comparing these two groups. As such, we compare whether difficulties finding items of necessity (e.g. food) and different forms of trauma including child sexual abuse, being bullied, trading sex, and street sexual victimization significantly differ for LGB and heterosexual homeless youth. Bivariate results reveal that LGB youth have more trouble finding shelter and are more likely to trade sex compared to heterosexual youth. Logistic regression results show that trading sex is correlated with street sexual victimization. In the second model, we find that being female, experiencing more child sexual abuse, and ever having traded sex are all positively linked with street sexual victimization. LGB youth are over-represented among homeless youth populations and are also more likely to trade sex; therefore, these young people need services that are widely accessible and specific to their needs. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",2018,,J.

Adverse childhood experiences and adjustment: A longitudinal study of street-involved youth in Brazil,"Raffaelli, M.; Santana, J.P.; de Morais, N.A.; Nieto, C.J.; Koller, S.H.","Most research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) has been conducted in high-income countries in the global North. The current longitudinal study examined the prevalence, overlap, and impact of ACEs in a sample of Brazilian children and adolescents who use city streets as spaces for socialization and survival (i.e., street-involved youth). Participants (N = 113; M age = 14.18 years) were recruited in three cities following standardized procedures. Most youth were male (80.5%) and non-White (91%). Lifetime exposure to ACEs was assessed at the first study time point; six indicators of psychological, behavioral, and physical adjustment were assessed 6 months later. Analyses addressed three research goals. First, the prevalence of seven ACEs was examined. Youth reported an average of 4.8 ACEs (SD = 1.25); no significant age or gender differences were found in ACEs exposure (all ps >.05). Second, the overlap between different ACEs was explored. Family dysfunction was correlated with family disruption and physical abuse; poverty and physical abuse were related (ps <.05). Third, prospective associations between ACEs and adjustment were tested. Total number of ACEs was not significantly correlated with any outcome, but several associations emerged for specific ACEs. For example, death of a close friend or family member was prospectively associated with negative affect; sexual abuse was associated with illicit drug use and physical health symptoms (ps <.05). Findings highlight the prevalence of ACEs in this vulnerable population and underscore the value of extending research on ACEs into novel populations and contexts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child Abuse Negl.,85,,91-100,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.07.032,,#2470,Raffaelli 2018,,

The Relationship between Homelessness and Behavior Problems among Youth in North Texas: a Brief Report,"Reingle Gonzalez, J.M.; Jetelina, K.K.; Roberts, M.; Clutter, M.O.; Sanders, C.; Baidhya, S.; Tsai, R.","This study sought to examine the relationship between homelessness and behavior problems among a community-based sample of youth in North Texas. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, probability sample of households and a targeted sample of homeless families in Dallas, Texas, with children older than 5 years old (N = 5232). Parents were asked to report five behavior problems on behalf of their children including arrest or trouble with police, academic problems, behavior problems at school, suspension, and suicide attempts. Logistic and negative binomial regression procedures were used to examine the relationship between homelessness and behavior problems. Youth exposed to homelessness were 36% (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.00–1.85) more likely to exhibit any kind of behavior problems than youth who had never experienced homelessness. Homeless youth had 5.51 times the odds of arrest (95% CI 2.60–11.68), 1.74 times the odds of academic problems (95% CI 1.24–2.43), and more than 3 times the odds of suicide attempts (95% CI 1.46, 7.61) than youth who had never been homeless. Homelessness was associated with higher rates of problem behavior, including arrests, academic problems, and suicide attempts. Because homeless youth are commonly enrolled in school and present at health care clinics and emergency departments, clinics and schools may aid in the identification of homeless youth, as well as referral to care. In this way, clinicians may help reduce the burden of behavioral problems that disproportionately affect homeless youth. © 2017, Southern Criminal Justice Association.",2018,,Am. J. Crim.

Acceptability of a Pilot Intervention of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision and HIV Education for Street-Connected Youth in Western Kenya,"Kibel, M.; Shah, P.; Ayuku, D.; Makori, D.; Kamaara, E.; Choge, E.; Nyairo, J.; Abuya, P.; Wahome, M.; Wachira, J.; Braitstein, P.","Purpose: Street-connected youth (SCY) in Kenya and elsewhere in sub–Saharan Africa are at high risk of HIV. Voluntary Male Medical Circumcision (VMMC) reduces the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission. Circumcision is also a traditional coming-of-age process in many Kenyan ethnic groups. This paper describes the acceptability of VMMC delivered as part of a ten-day healing, educational, and ‘coming-of-age’ retreat implemented as a pilot with SCY. Methods: Male SCY aged between 12 and 24 living on the street for more than 3 months were eligible to participate. The study took place over 10 days. After medical circumcision, youth participated in education modules. Data collected included qualitative semi-structured exit interviews featuring structured and open-ended questions about factors relevant to this intervention's acceptability. Results: There were 116 SCY (median age 14, IQR 13–15) who participated in the study. All were circumcised successfully, with no major complications. The majority of participants (81%) agreed that the circumcision procedure was uncomplicated, and 99% agreed the education was an important part of the initiation process. Thematic analysis of interview data highlighted four factors important to the program's acceptability: providing food, shelter, security; providing a safe place to heal; including traditional elements; and being with peers. Conclusions: This novel implementation of VMMC was found to be acceptable to SCY participants and could likely be adapted and scaled for HIV prevention and education with SCY elsewhere in Kenya and sub–Saharan Africa where circumcision is part of traditional coming-of-age processes. © 2018",2019,,J.

Running away during adolescence and future homelessness: The amplifying role of mental health,"Williams, A.; Giano, Z.; Merten, M.","Previous research indicates a positive link between youth runaway episodes and the likelihood of homelessness in later adolescence and early adulthood. An adolescent's decision to run away from home often accompanies depressive symptomology compared with stably housed youth. The present study used a large, nationally representative sample of 8,560 youth to identify links among runaway behavior, changes in depressive symptomology during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood, and homelessness. Results suggest that running away during adolescence is linked with later homelessness across depressive symptom classes. In fact, even a single runaway episode as a teenager tripled the odds of reporting homelessness by young adulthood. However, the magnitude of the association varies based on depressive symptom trajectories. Adolescents reporting high levels of depressive symptomology that increased over time were 6 times more likely to experience homelessness, compared with youth with consistently low depressive symptoms. Interestingly, among participants who reported never running away, this same high/increasing depressive symptoms group were less likely to report homelessness than were peers with consistently low depressive symptoms. These findings point to a potential resiliency process among youth in this category that needs to be further explored to identify differences in youth with poor mental health who leave home verses those who remain stably housed. © 2018 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.",2019,,Am.

Prevalence of hepatitis C virus among street children in Iran,"Behzadifar, M.; Gorji, H.A.; Rezapour, A.; Bragazzi, N.L.","Background: Street children are forced to spend a lot of time away from their homes and some of them do not have homes at all, due to economic and family problems, which makes them exposed to many health problems, such as the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Iran, like many other countries in the world, experiences the burden of street children, however, the rate of HCV among street children is virtually unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran. Main body: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The study protocol of this review was registered in PROSPERO under identification term CRD42018082336. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify published studies reporting on the prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran. Several international scholarly databases, including Web of Science, PubMed®/MEDLINE®, Embase, Scopus®, Google Scholar and Directory of Open Access Journals, as well as Iranian databases such as MagIran and Barakathns were searched. Studies published between 1988 and December 2017 with any of the following keywords were selected: (street OR homeless OR labour) AND (children OR child OR infant) AND (hepatitis C OR hepatitis C virus OR HCV OR viral hepatitis OR hepatitis OR hepacivirus) AND Iran. Moreover, a grey literature search was performed in order to obtain other potentially relevant studies. The search was carried out without any language restrictions. Four studies, surveying a total of 1691 street children, conducted between 2006 and 2017 were found to be eligible for inclusion in the review and therefore analysed. Three studies were conducted in Tehran and one in Isfahan. The prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran was found to be high, at 2.4% (95% CI: 1.8-3.3). Conclusions: Since the prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran is quite high, health decision- and policy-makers should pay more attention to street children and widen support channels, both social and economic. Further studies should be conducted among street children in different cities of Iran to add to the knowledge base of HCV among street children in the country.

Methods: Sixty-one street children were stratified by sex and then randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group by assigning each participant computerized random numbers. The intervention provided peer education services, focused on mode of disease transmission, prevention approaches and awareness of HIV/AIDS services by peers. Results: At least 80% of participants in the intervention and control groups completed the study period, respectively. At the end of the study, statistically significant increase of knowledge and attitude improvement as well as a decreased tendency to do risky sexual intercourse among the intervention subjects was shown. Moreover, there was a time intervention interaction for knowledge and attitude improvements followed by intervention (interaction p value = 0.001), while it was not significant for risky sexual behavior (interaction p value = 0.44). Conclusion: Peer education was an effective and easy-to-apply educational method that increased knowledge and improved attitudes about HIV/AIDS among foreign-origin street children, while it was less efficient with regard to long-term reduction in risky sexual behavior. © 2017",2018,,Clin.

Methods: From November 2015–February 2017, homeless youth served by Covenant House New Jersey, aged 18–22, received a trafficking assessment. Youth were stratified based upon trafficking experience, and their responses to demographic and social history questions were examined for association with trafficking occurrence. Results: Of 344 participants, 9.6% had a trafficking experience. Having an Individualized Education Program/504 plan was, for the first time in anti-trafficking literature, associated with a trafficking experience in bivariable analysis. IEP/504 plans are developed for school-aged children whose ability to succeed in traditional educational formats is challenged by learning, social, or functional problems. In the multivariable analysis, a history of arrest was associated with being trafficked while the presence of a supportive adult was associated with not being trafficked. Gender was not associated with a trafficking experience. Conclusions: This study is the largest to specifically assess homeless youth's demographic and social variables for association with trafficking experience. Homeless youth who are and are not trafficked share similar life experiences, but those with a supportive adult in their life had lower odds of being trafficked. Building upon our research, future investigations exploring order of occurrence will elucidate the risk factors for and protective factors against trafficking among homeless youth, contributing to evidence-based prevention efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

Adolescent connectedness with parents promotes resilience among homeless youth,"Aggerbeck Kessler, K.M.; Chatterjee, D.; Shlafer, R.; Barnes, A.J.","Youth who experience homelessness have worse health and well-being than housed youth. Internal assets, including social competency and positive self-identity, are factors that promote healthy development. This study compared internal assets between homeless and housed youth, and examined whether connectedness with parents moderates the association between homelessness and internal assets. Using data from a large population-based survey of middle-and high-school aged youth, we found that homelessness was associated with lower levels of internal assets. However, having high connectedness with a parent significantly predicted the strength of these assets, suggesting opportunities to promote health equity among homeless youth. © 2018 by the authors.

"“We Don’t Belong There”: New Geographies of Homelessness, Addiction, and Social Control in Vancouver’s Inner City","Fast, D.; Cunningham, D.","Drawing on eight years of ethnographic research in Vancouver’s inner city, we explore how aligned processes of gentrification and poverty management are producing new geographies of homelessness, addiction, and social control for young people who use drugs and inhabit the social, spatial, and economic margins of urban space. In particular, we examine the emergence of government-subsidized supportive housing for youth in this setting. Tracing the experiences of a small number of individuals across time, we show how this contemporary mode of urban governance is producing new forms of life and senses of place for young people in the margins, including new kinds of embodied displacement and disappearance in the city.

Racial and gender differences in missing children’s recovery chances,"Van De Rijt, A.; Song, H.-G.; Shor, E.; Burroway, R.","We inquire whether there are race and gender differences in the recovery of missing children. We argue that race and gender differences may arise due to differential media attention, socio-economic background and police resources. Datasets used in previous research lack the representativeness and longitudinal character necessary for probing victim demographic effects on recovery success. Here we use official New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services records of all children reported missing in the period 2007–2010 containing exact dates of disappearance and recovery. In event-history analysis of these data we find that missing boys and girls have comparable daily recovery chances. Black children, however, on average remain missing longer and are more likely to still be missing by the end of our observation period than non-black children. © 2018 van de Rijt et al.

It can be beautiful or destructive: Street-involved youth's perceptions of their romantic relationships and resilience,"Joly, L.E.; Connolly, J.","Introduction: This study examined romantic relationships among street-involved youth through the overlapping perspectives of resilience, attachment and social bonding. The main goal was to assess how youth understand their romantic attachment bonds as supporting or undermining resilience. While there are qualitative reports on how the social relationships of street-involved youth are linked to resilience, romantic relationships have yet to be differentiated with regard to resilience. This paper also builds on existing research by providing further information on the characteristics of their romantic relationships, and the impact of street life and risky behaviours within relationships. Methods: Twenty-one youth (11 men and 10 women) in shelters, in a Canadian metropolitan city, aged 16–24 years, participated in semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis of the data was conducted exploring how the youth understand their romantic attachments as well as their links in supporting or undermining resilience. Results: Results indicated that connection, support, validation, and encouragement within a relationship were of value to the youth's resilience, in the form of addressing drug use, achieving goals, supporting self-worth, and promoting positive coping. The youth also reported many negative experiences within their romantic relationships, including dating violence and the stress of street-life, which they saw as undermining their resilience. A key finding was that the youth had considerable difficulty integrating the positive and negative aspects of their relationships. Overall the findings highlight the co-occurrence of positive and negative romantic experiences, and support the importance of developing healthy relationship programs for street-involved youth.

Queering the welfare state: Paradigmatic heteronormativity after obergefell,"Barnett, M.J.","Although lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer people in the United States of America have experienced significant changes in their legal rights over the previous decade, they are still disproportionately likely to live in poverty. The Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges granted LGBQ individuals access to the institution of marriage and the attendant social benefits, but the safety net is still full of holes for low-income LGBQ individuals because of deeply rooted heteronormativity in the administration of welfare. Using three facially neutral examples= proof-of-paternity requirements for welfare recipients, work requirements for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid programs, and barriers to state support for low-income LGBQ youth experiencing homelessness= this Note elucidates and indicts enduring paradigms of heteronormativity in the welfare state.

I ultimately seek to situate my future doctoral work, an oral history of queer youth homelessness in Ontario, within the scholarship surveyed here.

Minimal research, however, has focused on the extent to which single- or multiple-system involvement influences school dropout. Relying on an integrated data set, the associations between single- and multiple-system utilization and risk for dropping out, or actually dropping out of school, among youth in Grades 7 through 9 were examined. Results showed dropout rates more than doubled among public youth system users compared with those in the overall sample. With a few exceptions, use of combinations of services systems translated into somewhat higher likelihoods of dropping out of school when compared with single-system use.

The Association between Incarceration and Transactional Sex among HIV-infected Young Men Who Have Sex with Men in the United States,"Philbin, M.M.; Kinnard, E.N.; Tanner, A.E.; Ware, S.; Chambers, B.D.; Ma, A.; Fortenberry, J.D.","Criminal justice practices in the USA disproportionately affect sexual and racial/ethnic minority men, who are at higher risk of incarceration. Previous research demonstrates associations between incarceration and sexual risk behaviors for men who have sex with men (MSM). However, little of this work focuses on young MSM (YMSM), particularly HIV-infected YMSM, despite nearly one-third reporting engagement in sexual risk behaviors, such as transactional sex. We therefore explored the association between incarceration and transactional sex among HIV-infected YMSM. We recruited 97 HIV-infected YMSM across 14 clinical sites in urban centers from August 2015 to February 2016. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the relationship between incarceration and transactional sex among YMSM. The majority was 24 years old (78%) and racial/ethnic minority (95%); over half were not in school and reported an annual income of < $12,000. In the multivariate model, having ever been incarcerated (aOR = 3.20; 95% CI 1.07–9.63) was independently associated with a history of transactional sex. Being 24 years vs. younger (aOR = 9.68; 95% CI 1.42–65.78) and having ever been homeless (aOR = 3.71, 95% CI 1.18–11.65) also remained independently associated with a history of transactional sex. This analysis fills a gap in the literature by examining the relationship between incarceration and transactional sex among HIV-infected YMSM. Facilitating youths’ engagement with social services available in their HIV clinic may serve as a key strategy in promoting health. Public health efforts need to address social-structural factors driving disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration and related harms among this population. © 2018, The New York Academy of Medicine.",2018,,Urban Health,95,4,576-583,,10.1007/s11524-018-0247-5,,#2501,Philbin 2018,,
Health Issues Associated with Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Sex Trafficking of Children in the United States: A Systematic Review,"Le, P.D.; Ryan, N.; Rosenstock, Y.; Goldmann, E.","This article reviews studies examining health issues associated with commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking (CSE/ST) of children in the United States. We searched five health and social sciences databases for peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 1990 and April 2017. After independent screening of the records, we identified 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Descriptions of the included studies and their definitions of CSE/ST are provided. Most of the studies sampled children and youth in urban, metropolitan areas and employed cross-sectional surveys or reviewed case files and medical records of convenience samples. Studies differed widely in their operationalization of CSE/ST, which limit systematic comparison across studies and the generalizability of findings. Qualitative analysis of the included studies shows that among commercially sexually exploited/trafficked children, there are elevated burdens of substance use and abuse, mental health disorders such as depression, PTSD, suicidal behaviors, and sexual and reproductive health issues including STIs, HIV, and pregnancy. This review underscores the need for more empirical studies, to guide an evidence-based understanding of and response to the range and complexity of the health issues in this population. Of particular utility are studies that address some of the methodological limitations of prior research in this field (e.g., cross-sectional, convenience samples) and those that assess overlooked health issues (e.g., malnutrition, eating disorders, post-trauma growth, and long-term health consequences). © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,Behav.

Anaemia and associated factors in homeless children in the Paris region: The ENFAMS survey,"Arnaud, A.; Lioret, S.; Vandentorren, S.; Le Strat, Y.","Background: Food insecurity is a major concern in homeless population, however nutritional consequences remain poorly documented, especially for children. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of anaemia and to investigate the relation between both food insecurity and dietary intake to moderate-to-severe anaemia (MSA) in homeless sheltered children. Methods: In 2013, a cross-sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of 801 sheltered homeless families in the Paris region. Haemoglobin concentration was measured in 630 mother/child dyads and questionnaires administrated to mothers collected socio-demographic, socioeconomic, health and dietary data. Factors associated with MSA were analysed in two stratified child age groups; 0.5-5 and 6-12 years old. Results: Anaemia was detected in 39.9% of the children and 50.6% of the mothers, and MSA in 22.3% and 25.6%, respectively. In both age groups, MSA was positively associated with maternal MSA. In the 0.5- 5 years group, it was also positively associated with child food insecurity, no cooking facilities and household monthly income. In the 6-12 years group, it was positively associated with household food insecurity and children's age. Conclusion: A higher food insecurity score was associated with greater prevalence of moderateto-severe anaemia in children. Considering the high prevalence of anaemia among homeless mothers and their children, these findings highlight the need for reducing food insecurity in shelters so as to prevent anaemia in this vulnerable population. © The Author 2017.",2018,,Eur.

Getting by and getting ahead: Social capital and transition to college among homeless and foster youth,"Skobba, K.; Meyers, D.; Tiller, L.","Despite the desire and motivation to earn a college degree, only a small portion of young adults who have experienced homelessness or in foster care succeed in achieving this goal. Some of the very familiar challenges encountered throughout childhood– the lack of a stable home, financial resources to cover basic needs, inadequate academic preparation and stability, and the lack of a support system - often persist into young adulthood making the transition to college especially difficult. This qualitative study examines the academic pathways of 33 college students with a history or foster care placement, homelessness, or both, to better understand the ways in which forms of social capital influence the transition to college and early college experiences. Many of the student participants described receiving both social support and social leverage in high school through family members, teachers, and adult role models who provided encouragement or developed connections to resources and opportunities. In high school, this support often helped students get ahead by providing access to the information and resources needed to take entrance tests, complete applications and forms, and secure college acceptance. In college, students relied on social support to meet basic needs and maintain enrollment financially and academically. Many students received or fostered social leverage in college through adult mentors and engagement in student organizations and activities. More research is needed to understand the role of aid and social resources in helping young adults who have experienced foster care or homelessness access and complete higher education and what separates these students from others who have not successfully developed social capital and social leverage networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

Methods: Scores for 13 food categories were computed; higher scores indicated a greater availability of foods found in that category. A summative score was computed to assess the presence of obesogenic foods. Results: Dry cereal, vegetables, and meat, were the most available foods; 83.3%, 60.9%, and 56.3% of food items in each category, respectively, were available. The food categories with least available items included candy and dairy: 26.6% and 25.4% of items in those categories, respectively. Mean obesogenic food availability score was 31 ± 4.2 (range 23–34), out of a possible score of 71.

What would we use and how would we use it? Can digital technology be used to both enhance and evaluate well-being outcomes with highly vulnerable and disadvantaged young people?,"Vichta, R.; Gwinner, K.; Collyer, B.","An increasing number of technology apps for managing wellbeing and mental health are permeating young people’s use of digital spaces. There are a range of online wellbeing tools which have been developed to promote self-tracking and build young people’s wellbeing and mental health, for example, Optimism, My Mood Tracker and Strava. Tracking outcomes of support with highly transient young people is, more broadly, a particular challenge for youth workers, evaluators and social researchers. Using digital apps to promote as well as monitor wellbeing with tech-savvy young people is an enticing prospect for youth support services, particularly with young people whose engagement with support is sporadic and unpredictable during periods of homelessness or other crisis situations. The use of purpose-designed digital apps may have the potential to not only benefit young people’s mental health and wellbeing, but also enhance the consistency and quality of their connection with support services. In principle, putting wellbeing digital tools directly into the hands, and phones, of young people who are accessing support services seems to make good sense. A great number of online resources have, however, relatively limited uptake in highly vulnerable youth populations. The design starting point must therefore be, what would they use and how would they use it? How can digital apps help to promote stronger support engagement, be aligned with young people’s perspectives and priorities of wellbeing, and enable better outcomes evaluation? This article shares learnings from a consultation with more than 400 young youth service users to build better understanding of their relationships with digital technologies, what they would use and how they would use it to better connect with support as well as to promote and record changes in wellbeing over time. Exploring the young people’s perspectives on wellbeing, service delivery and use of digital technologies has broad implications for the integration of digital technology into both service delivery and evaluation of youth programmes. The findings suggest that digital platforms can play a role in evaluating youth wellbeing over time. The prerequisites, are however, that young people’s autonomy and individuality must be supported. We need to start from a place that facilitates agency and creativity, and focuses on capturing qualitative data that meet young people in their world – even when this is challenging for us. © The Author(s) 2018.",2018,,Eval.

Health policy making for street children: Challenges and strategies,"Abdi, F.; Saeieh, S.E.; Roozbeh, N.; Yazdkhasti, M.","Background: The phenomenon of street children is a bio-psychological and social issue that not only harms children, but also endangers the health of a society. In line with the national programs for the development and promotion of street children's health in Iran, health policy making and essential strategies for this group of children will be presented in this paper. This paper will discuss the main issues and challenges of street children's health and, also, health policy and guidelines for this population. Methods: In this review study, the keywords; street children, health, challenges, policy, and health policy making were searched through PubMed, SID, Iranmedex, World Health Organization (WHO), Emro, the Cochran Library, Medline and Google scholar to collect data. The search resulted in 84 related resources from which 48 cases that were more relevant to this research and covered the issue more comprehensively, were used. All data published during 2002-2015 have been included in this paper. Results: Key concepts including street children and their health, health policy, strategies to improve the health of street children, health policy approaches for street children, the WHO's strategies, and social support program for street children must be considered in the health policy making processes for street children, as precise identification of the relevant information makes planning more effective in health policy making for this group of children. Conclusion: The phenomenon of street children is a growing problem in the world and it has turned into a serious concern in many countries including Iran.

Utilizing Housing Resources for Homeless Youth Through the Lens of Multiple Multi-Dimensional Knapsacks,"Chan, H.; Tran-Thanh, L.; Wilder, B.; Rice, E.; Vayanos, P.; Tambe, M.","There are over 1 million homeless youth in the U.S. each year. To reduce homelessness, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and housing communities provide housing programs/services to homeless youth with the goal of improving their long-term situation. Housing communities are facing a difficult task of filling their housing programs, with as many youths as possible, subject to resource constraints for meeting the needs of youth. Currently, the assignment is manually done by humans working in the housing communities. In this paper, we consider the problem of assigning homeless youth to housing programs subject to resource constraints. We provide an initial abstract model for this setting and show that the problem of maximizing the total assigned youth to the programs under this model is APX-hard. To solve the problem, we non-trivially formulate it as a multiple multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MMDKP), which is not known to have any approximation algorithm. We provide a first interpretable and easy-to-use greedy algorithm with logarithmic approximation ratio for solving general MMDKP. We conduct experiments on random and realistic instances of the housing assignment settings and show that our algorithm is efficient and effective in solving large instances (up to 1 million youth). © 2018 ACM.",2018,,"AIES 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,41-47,,10.1145/3278721.3278757,,#2513,Chan 2018,,
Providing Solutions to LGBT Homeless Youth: Lessons From Baltimore’s Youth Empowered Society,"Dolamore, S.; Naylor, L.A.","In the United States, nearly 1.7 million youth under the age of 18 run away from home and often end up homeless each year. Reports estimate that between 20% and 40% of the runaway and homeless youth population identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) (Durso & Gates, 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014). This suggests that as many as 80,000 LGBT youth are homeless for over a week each year (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2012). In addition, LGBT youth are more likely to suffer from poverty, substance abuse, violence, mental illness, and attempted suicide as a result of harassment and discrimination (Cray, Miller, & Durso, 2013; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014; Swan, 2014). Grounded in social equity theory (Frederickson, 2010) and intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1991), this article argues that additional legal protections are necessary in order to ensure the constitutional rights of LGBT youth.

Improving the evidence base for services working with youth at-risk of involvement in the criminal justice system: developing a standardised program approach,"Knight, A.; Maple, M.; Shakeshaft, A.; Shakehsaft, B.; Pearce, T.","Background: Young people who engage in multiple risk behaviour (high-risk young people) such as substance abuse, antisocial behaviour, low engagement in education and employment, self-harm or suicide ideation are more likely to experience serious harms later in life including homelessness, incarceration, violence and premature death. In addition to personal disadvantage, these harms represent an avoidable social and economic cost to society. Despite these harms, there is insufficient evidence about how to improve outcomes for high-risk young people. A key reason for this is a lack of standardisation in the way in which programs provided by services are defined and evaluated. Methods: This paper describes the development of a standardised intervention model for high-risk young people. The model can be used by service providers to achieve greater standardisation across their programs, outcomes and outcome measures. To demonstrate its feasibility, the model is applied to an existing program for high-risk young people. Conclusions: The development and uptake of a standardised intervention model for these programs will help to more rapidly develop a larger and more rigorous evidence-base to improve outcomes for high-risk young people. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,,Health Justice,6,1,,,10.1186/s40352-018-0066-5,,#2517,Knight 2018,,
Contextual constraints and choices: Strategic identity management among LGBTQ youth,"Schmitz, R.M.; Tyler, K.A.","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) young people's identity management impacts their well-being, yet little is known about how distinctive social environments shape their identity management strategies. We qualitatively examined how 46 LGBTQ young adults ages 19–26, who are either homeless or attending college, manage their identities across distinctive social contexts. Young adults engaged in identity concealment, which extended across social context as both groups grappled with masking their identities. Furthermore, both groups of young people adapted to socioenvironmental challenges in navigating identity within social relationships. Finally, young adults emphasized the contextual importance of maintaining agency within identity. Understanding how LGBTQ young people immersed in various social contexts traverse identity-related challenges and establish effective coping strategies is essential in developing diverse social programs for this population. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",2018,,J.

The invisibility of disability for homeless youth,"Baker Collins, S.; Schormans, A.F.; Watt, L.; Idems, B.; Wilson, T.","A largely unexplored complexity in the lives of youth who have experienced homeless is the presence of intellectual, developmental and/or learning disabilities. Although emerging research shows that youth with cognitive disabilities are more likely to become homeless and that rates of cognitive disabilities are higher among the homeless population than the population in general, exploring the intersection of disability and homelessness for youth has not been a priority. In this study, a critical disability and systems failure lens is brought to bear on the vulnerability of youth who experience this intersection. Based on interviews with key informants in the disability, homelessness, education, employment and child welfare sectors in three sites in Ontario, Canada, the invisibility of disability among homeless youth is brought to light. We explore the ways youth with a disability in the homelessness sector are made vulnerable, the insurmountable barriers to getting access to the requisite assessment for disability services and the siloed nature of the homelessness and disability service sectors. An argument is made that “working outside the box” to assist youth to navigate significant system disjunctures is insufficient. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,J.

"Factors that contribute to help-seeking among homeless, trauma-exposed youth: A social-ecological perspective","Crosby, S.D.; Hsu, H.-T.; Jones, K.; Rice, E.","Homeless youth are at great risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during homelessness. The social-ecological framework provides a lens to examine the multifaceted characteristics that promote various types of help-seeking among homeless youth with high trauma exposure. The present study uses baseline data from homeless youth interviewed in a longitudinal study to examine utilization of physical health, vocational, and mental health services among this population. The study explores the following research question: What social-ecological factors are associated with physical health, vocational, and mental health help-seeking among homeless youth with PTSS? Homeless youth, aged 13 to 26, who used drop-in services at collaborating sites were recruited and interviewed. Youth participants with PTSS were included in this study. Logistic regression models were conducted to analyze individual, family/peer, and community contextual factors in relation to three types of service utilization (i.e., physical health, vocational, and mental health services). Among individual factors, duration of homelessness was associated with increased physical and mental health service utilization, injection drug-use was linked to decreased mental health services, and race/ethnicity was associated with increased help-seeking across all three service types. For family/peer level factors, foster care involvement was linked to increased mental health help-seeking and social support from street-based peers was associated with greater vocational service utilization. Among community-level factors, youth who reported receiving social support from community-based providers were more likely to seek out mental health services. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child. Youth Serv. Rev.,93,,126-134,,10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.07.015,,#2520,Crosby 2018,,

Hope Street: From Voice to Agency for Care-Leavers in Higher Education,"Wilson, J.Z.; Mendes, P.; Golding, F.","In the early 1980s, one of the authors became an adolescent ward of the State of Victoria, Australia, and went into out-of-home care. While in care, repeated encounters with researchers, journalists and policy-makers left her disillusioned as to the efficacy and relevance of their activities, in that although she was sporadically provided with a ‘voice’, this did little to bridge the divide between their world of privilege and the non-privileged world of the subject of their attentions. The article argues that this divide is perpetuated long after people leave care as adults, and that a mere ‘voice’ is not enough–what is needed is agency, in the design and execution of research. This can be achieved through extended education, depending in turn on an inclusive culture shift within institutions of higher learning.

But Everyone is Doing It (Sort of)! Perceived Sexual Risks in the Social Environment and the Impact on Homeless Youth Engagement in Concurrent Sexual Relationships,"Hsu, H.-T.; Fulginiti, A.; Rice, E.; Rhoades, H.; Winetrobe, H.; Danforth, L.","Although homeless youth are likely to engage in concurrent sexual relationships and doing so can accelerate HIV transmission, the issue of sexual concurrency (i.e., having sexual partnerships that overlap in time) has received scarce attention in this vulnerable population. The literature that exists tends to focus on individuals’ characteristics that may be associated with concurrency and overlooks the influence of their social environment. Informed by the risk amplification and abatement model (RAAM), this study explored the association between pro-social and problematic social network connections, and sexual concurrency among homeless youth using drop-in center services (N = 841). Nearly 37% of youth engaged in concurrency. Partially consistent with the RAAM, regression analyses showed that affiliation with more problematic ties (i.e., having more network members who practice concurrency and unprotected sex) was associated with greater sexual concurrency. Programs addressing HIV risk among homeless youth in drop-in centers should consider the role youths’ network composition may play in concurrency. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018,,AIDS Behav.,22,11,3508-3518,,10.1007/s10461-018-2133-2,,#2524,Hsu 2018,,
The experiences of being a young LGBTIQ and homeless in Australia: Re-thinking policy and practice,"Oakley, S.; Bletsas, A.","Drawing on the perspectives of young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer (LGBTIQ) people who have experienced homelessness across metropolitan Adelaide and Sydney, Australia, the article outlines many of the challenges and barriers that confronted them. We argue that traditional views in policy and practice that treat homelessness as a homogeneous category are detrimental to this young cohort. With more young people identifying as LGBTIQ, a greater number of them are seeking services, support and housing assistance. Yet, as we highlight, this has had the effect of a shortage of suitable and safe accommodation and support to assist young LGBTIQ people.

Substance Use and Social Stability of Homeless Youth: A Comparison of Three Interventions,"Zhang, J.; Slesnick, N.","The current study identified subgroups of homeless youth and young adults that exhibited distinct co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability (e.g., employment, school attendance, and housing), and evaluated the relative effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and case management (CM) in interrupting substance use and improving social stability. The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n 93, MET, n 86, or CM, n 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth. © 2018 American Psychological Association.",2018,,Psychol.

The Effectiveness of Internet- and Field-Based Methods to Recruit Young Adults Who Use Prescription Opioids Nonmedically,"Marshall, B.D.L.; Green, T.C.; Elston, B.; Yedinak, J.L.; Hadland, S.E.; Clark, M.A.","Background: Nonmedical prescription opioid (NMPO) use is a problem among young adults, yet young NMPO users are a diverse population that has been challenging to engage in overdose prevention and harm reduction programs. Objectives: This study compared the effectiveness and characteristics of persons recruited through two different sampling strategies to inform research and intervention efforts with young adult NMPO users. Methods: We analyzed data from the Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription Drug Study (RAPiDS), which enrolled persons aged 18 to 29 who reported past 30-day NMPO use. We compared the characteristics of two samples recruited simultaneously between February 2015 and February 2016. One sample was recruited using field-based strategies (e.g., respondent-driven sampling, transit ads), and a second from internet sources (e.g., online classifieds). Results: Among 198 eligible participants, the median age was 25 (IQR: 22, 27), 130 (65.7%) were male, 123 (63.1%) were white, and 150 (78.1%) resided in urban areas. A total of 79 (39.9%) were recruited using field-based strategies and 119 (60.1%) were recruited from internet sources.

"Sexual and physical abuse and its determinants among street children in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 2016","Chimdessa, A.; Cheire, A.","Background: The life and health of street children is becoming a global concern. Street children are vulnerable to a variety of problems including physical, psychological and sexual exploitations as well as social isolation. Therefore, it was the purpose of this study to point out the experience of sexual and physical exploitation and its determinant factors among street children in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Methodology: A phenomenological qualitative method was conducted from March to June 2016 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data were collected from street children by focus group discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview. Open code was used to analyze data. The transcribed note was translated. Following this coding was done. Based on a coding book, major themes and main categories were developed and analyzed. Result: The study has explored the life experience of street children in the city. Deaths of parents/unhealthy relationship of extended families forced them be on a street. Thus, flee to street to search for work was the main reason for joining to a street. Street children are vulnerable to sexual and physical exploitations on a daily basis. For street children, street is the world characterized by misery deprivation, physical, verbal and sexual abuse and become daily victims of violence. There is no safe place for the children of on-street. Most street children are involved in all types of sex; heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual and group sex are common among themselves and out siders. They are involved highly in transactional sex for survival. Drug use, stress and depression are common experiences. Thus, they were socially isolated. The main challenges of living on a street are lack of basic needs, social isolation, lack of safety and security and being out of school are the common problems these vulnerable groups are facing. Conclusions: Street children are at high risk of sexual and physical exploitation. Interventions targeting integration and reunion with families, reduction of physical and sexual exploitation, access to education, mental health promotion and reduction of drug use behavior should be taken in to considerations. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,,BMC Pediatr.,18,1,,,10.1186/s12887-018-1267-8,,#2543,Chimdessa 2018,,

The association between homelessness and mental health was not moderated by perceived teacher support. However, victimization experiences served as a moderator such that more victimization exacerbated the effect of homelessness on mental health challenges.

The children’s ages were between 13-18 yr, attending grades between 7-12th grade. Methods: The sample group was 54,928 students in Sanliurfa, Turkey. The data were analyzed using Chi-square test (P<0.05). Results: 82.8% of working children were male. 92.5% were elder than 12 yr old and 85.8 % had more than 4 siblings. 52.7% of the families’ income was less than 1,000 TL per month. 79.9% of the children had worked in different places before. The distribution of working places was 66.4% in an establishment, 9.5% in the fields, 7.5% in the bazaar and in the streets, 2.8% in bus terminal, 2.9% in industry, 2.5% in parks. The 46.3% of the children stated that they are working willingly. 50.7% were working 6 to 10 h a day. 64.4% were giving the money they earned to their families. 82.1% of the children stated that they liked to attend the school but 62.8% sometimes did not go to school. 20.6% went to work instead of school in those days. The 62.2% of the children answered the question; “According to you, should the children work?” with;”No”. Conclusion: The children started working at very early ages and they faced unfavorable situations.

"Cost and cost-effectiveness of voluntary medical male circumcision in street-connected youth: Findings from an education-based pilot intervention in Eldoret, Kenya","Galárraga, O.; Shah, P.; Wilson-Barthes, M.; Ayuku, D.; Braitstein, P.","Background: Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a critical component of HIV prevention. VMMC policies have achieved initial targets in adult men yet continue to fall short in reaching younger men and adolescents. Setting: We present the cost and scale-up implications of an education-based, VMMC intervention for adolescent street-connected males, for whom the street has become their home and/or source of livelihood. The intervention was piloted as part of the Engaging Street Youth in HIV Interventions Project in Eldoret, Kenya. Methods: We used a micro-costing approach to estimate the average cost of a VMMC intervention in 116 street-connected youth. Average cost was estimated per individual and per cohort by dividing total cost per intervention by number of clients accessing the intervention over a 30-day period. Total average costs included direct and support procedure costs, educational costs, and direct research costs. Cost-effectiveness was measured in cost per DALYs averted over a 5 and 10-year period. Results: The total cost of the intervention was $12,526 over the 30-day period, with an average cost per individual of $108. The direct VMMC procedure cost was approximately $9 per individual. Personnel costs contributed the greatest percentage to the total intervention cost (38.2%), with mentors and social workers representing the highest wage earners. Retreat-related and education costs contributed 51% and 13% respectively to the total average cost, with surgical equipment costs contributing less than 1%. At a cost of $108 per individual, the intervention averted 60166 DALYs in 5years resulting in a cost per DALY averted of $267. Conclusion: The VMMC intervention was highly cost-effective in Kenya, despite the additional costs incurred to reach SCY.

Funds of identity and humanizing research as a means of combating deficit perspectives of homelessness in the middle grades,"Moulton, M.","Youth experiencing homelessness have seldom had the opportunity to contribute to conversations about policies and practices that impact their day-to-day lives. Brinegar highlighted middle level education research’s contribution to the lack of representation of the voices of youth from marginalized perspectives. Where opportunities lack, dominant narratives persist. The word homeless often conjures deficit-laden images of ineptitude and unintelligence. This qualitative humanizing research study worked with one participant, AJ, who created maps and other identity artifacts as a means of illuminating his funds of identity that were then analyzed using Creswell and Poth’s data analysis spiral. Though results showed AJ to be a young adolescent with multiple funds of identity, the purpose of this article is to present how AJ draws great strength and purpose from his identity as a creator, despite transience between schools, who leverages technology for his personal and academic benefit. These results describe a young adolescent whose resilience and funds of identity transcend dominant narratives surrounding homelessness and point to opportunities for educator support in curriculum development and school-level policy. © 2018 by the authors.

Providing culturally informed mental health services to Aboriginal youth: The YouthLink model in Western Australia,"Sabbioni, D.; Feehan, S.; Nicholls, C.; Soong, W.; Rigoli, D.; Follett, D.; Carastathis, G.; Gomes, A.; Griffiths, J.; Curtis, K.; Smith, W.; Waters, F.","Aim: Aboriginal young people are more likely to experience mental health issues and to access mental health services than other young Australians, yet there are few culturally informed mental health programs and services available. This study describes and documents the effectiveness of the culturally sensitive model within YouthLink, a state-wide mental health service program in Western Australia for young people aged 13 to 24 years of age. Methods: A mixed-method design including a descriptive approach reporting on the YouthLink framework and an empirical research design where 40 Aboriginal clients completed client feedback monitoring measures between 2014 and 2016. Results: The YouthLink culturally informed conceptual framework adheres to best practice principles relevant to work with Indigenous people, family and communities. Aboriginal young people indicated improvement across the treatment period as shown by within-group differences between the first and last session scores on feedback measures. Therapeutic alliance (together with lower baseline acuity and female gender) also contributed significantly to positive treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Through a strong role of Aboriginal practitioners, relationships with Aboriginal communities, and greater service flexibility that embraces cultural meaning and knowledge, YouthLink has sought to enhance its response to the needs of Aboriginal youth. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2018,,Early Intervent.

Assessing risk of commercial sexual exploitation among children involved in the child welfare system,"Panlilio, C.C.; Miyamoto, S.; Font, S.A.; Schreier, H.M.C.","The objective of this study was to assess item characteristics indicative of the severity of risk for commercial sexual exploitation among a high-risk population of child welfare system involved youth to inform the construction of a screening tool. Existing studies have discerned factors that differentiate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) victims from sexual abuse victims, yet no research has been conducted to discriminate which items in a high risk population of youth are most predictive of CSEC. Using the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) cohorts I and II, we examined responses from 1063 males and 1355 females ages 11 and older, over three interview periods. A 2-parameter logistic Item Response Theory (2 PL IRT) model was employed in order to examine item performance as potential indicators for the severity of risk for CSEC. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted in order to examine potential differences in item responses based on gender. Modeling strategies to assess item difficulty and discrimination were outlined and Item Characteristic Curves for the final retained items were presented. Evidence for uniform DIF were present within items that asked about runaway, any drug use, suicidality, and experiencing severe violence. Results from this study can inform the construction of a screening instrument to assess the severity of risk for experiencing CSEC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Child Abuse Negl.,87,,88-99,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.07.021,,#2569,Panlilio 2019,,
"Trends in homeless children and young adults seeking shelter in a boston pediatric emergency department following state housing policy changes, 2011–2016","Kanak, M.; Stewart, A.; Vinci, R.; Liu, S.; Sandel, M.","Objectives. To describe a trend in emergency department (ED) use by homeless children and young adults before and after a state housing policy change in 2012 and to quantify financial and time costs to the health care system. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed de-identified electronic medical records of homeless children and young adults aged 0 to 21 years seeking shelter at an urban tertiary pediatric ED in Boston, Massachusetts, between September 1, 2011, and August 31, 2016. Results. We identified 1078 visits for homelessness by 916 children and young adults. The median number of visits per month increased from 3 before the policy change to 17 after (P < .001). The total hospital charges were $578 351, with a net payment of $214 231, 97% paid by Medicaid. The average length of stay was 8 hours, totaling more than 8500 hours of occupancy. Conclusions. The number of homeless children and young adults who visited a pediatric ED increased significantly following a housing policy change, leading to substantial resource burdens on the ED and Medicaid. Public Health Implications. Policymakers should consider potential health care costs when designing housing policies and consider investing in housing to prevent unnecessary ED visits. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Patterns and Intensity of use of homeless shelters intoronto,"Jadidzadeh, A.; Kneebone, R.","A large administrative data set allows us to examine shelter use by single adults, youth, and families in Toronto. We find important differences in shelter use by single adults, youth, and families. We introduce an approach that allows us to identify a noticeable increase in the percentage of shelter clients whom we define as chronic users of the shelter system—people for whom each episode of shelter use is typically very long. This should be a concern because chronic users of the system, although they make up only a small fraction of all shelter clients, fill more than 40 percent of shelter capacity. A growing number of chronic shelter users will strain the ability of the shelter system to provide shelter to those seeking temporary relief while they re-establish themselves into housing.

Family Care Curriculum: A Parenting Support Program for Families Experiencing Homelessness,"Sheller, S.L.; Hudson, K.M.; Bloch, J.R.; Biddle, B.; Krauthamer Ewing, E.S.; Slaughter-Acey, J.C.","Purpose In the United States, families with children characterize the fastest growing portion of the homeless population. Parenting for families experiencing homelessness presents unique challenges since families facing homelessness are disproportionately more likely to experience a myriad of interpersonal and contextual stressors that heighten the risk of parents engaging in suboptimal parenting approaches. This article describes the development and implementation of the Family Care Curriculum (FCC) train-the-trainer parenting support program specifically designed to support positive parenting in families experiencing homelessness. Description The FCC is a 6-week theory-based parenting intervention aimed to create positive shifts in parental attitudes to enhance sensitive and nurturing parenting and positive parent–child relationships. FCC assists parents in reflecting on how their own experiences contribute to some of their parenting beliefs, patterns, and behaviors. Parents are coached to imagine and understand the emotions, attachment, and developmental needs behind their children’s behaviors so they can maintain empathic and nurturing parenting responses in the context of cumulative and chronic stress. Parents are supported through learning to engage in self-care. A unique and important feature of the FCC is the inclusion of a culturally sensitive approach that takes into consideration the effects of racism, classism, and oppression on parent–child relationships. Conclusion FCC was designed, implemented, and championed by expert providers in the fields of family therapy, social work, and pediatrics to support parents experiencing homelessness. FCC adds to the body of effective attachment-based, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive parenting interventions for improving parent–child relations and family health amongst vulnerable populations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018,,Matern.

Homelessness in the child welfare system: A randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of housing subsidies on foster care placements and costs,"Fowler, P.J.; Brown, D.S.; Schoeny, M.; Chung, S.","Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) – a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy (n = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone (n = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity. © 2018",2018,,Child Abuse Negl.,83,,52-61,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.07.014,,#2574,Fowler 2018,,
“The one thing that actually helps”: Art creation as a self-care and health-promoting practice amongst youth experiencing homelessness,"Schwan, K.J.; Fallon, B.; Milne, B.","Arts-based programming has increasingly been offered to youth experiencing homelessness in various service settings, often grounded in the belief that this type of programming can promote mental wellness and recovery, social inclusion, and life skills. Despite the ubiquity of such programs, there is limited research on the impacts and value of arts creation for youth who are homeless. Drawing on 23 in-depth interviews with youth experiencing homelessness and staff at a large youth homeless shelter, this study explores the importance, meanings, roles, and effects of art creation and art-based programming in the lives of youth who are homeless. Analysis identified five key ways that youth experiencing homelessness use the arts to cope with adversity and create meaning, including to: manage mental health challenges; cope with stress and homelessness; recover from trauma and create ‘safe spaces’; explore, express, and discover themselves; and develop positive self-esteem and hopefulness for the future. Findings revealed the complex and highly personal ways through which youth strategically use art creation as a self-care and health-promoting practice. These findings demonstrate the importance of developing arts-based interventions that employ a positive youth development approach and support youth's own self-care and meaning-making practices. Implications for practice and policy are discussed, including the need for art programs to build upon the positive arts-based practices youth are already employing in their efforts to improve their health, pursue their goals, and empower themselves. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

LGBT Homeless Youth and Policing,"McCandless, S.","LGBT homeless youth are a particularly vulnerable population, accounting for 20–40% of all homeless youth. Literature demonstrates that these youth are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system. Involvement in the justice system frequently begins with a police contact, about which relatively little is understood. Fear of the police among LGBT homeless youth is likely common, and police may be ill-equipped to interact with and assist these youth, even when programs specific to improving police-LGBT relations are present. The present exploratory study examines how LGBT homeless youth and police interact by presenting findings from 18 interviews with formerly homeless LGBT youths (now adults), LGBT advocates, and police officers. Findings reveal that fear of the police and reports of discriminatory actions by police are common, LGBT youth have difficulty accessing services, and police often report being limited in how they can help this population. © 2017, Copyright © American Society for Public Administration.",2018,,Public Integr.,20,6,558-570,,10.1080/10999922.2017.1402738,,#2584,McCandless 2018,,
Conceptualizing the social and cultural organization of street life among young people experiencing homelessness,"Frederick, T.","Research on youth homelessness has documented the unique and complex ways that youth relate to one another on the street and engage with their social environments. This work draws from a varied set of concepts, including concepts from subcultural theory, the youth geographies literature, and Bourdieu’s practice theory. However, little work to date considers how to integrate these different conceptualizations and perspectives on how young people experiencing homelessness engage culture and organize themselves socially in the course of their time on the street. This paper explores this question by using interviews and fieldwork with a group of 39 homeless and street-involved young people in Canada. Through this analysis, I outline a multilayered and practice focused perspective that focuses on the active way that young people engage and navigate the diverse social and cultural landscapes of street life. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,J.

Leaving an Institution in Flanders (Belgium): A Road to Homelessness?,"Verstraete, J.; Pannecoucke, I.; Meeus, B.; De Decker, P.","People living in an institution will leave this residential context one day and have to proceed to a stable independent way of living. This transition is not without difficulties as it turns out this socially vulnerable group runs an increased risk of becoming homeless. Research in Flanders (Belgium) has shown that a considerable share of the homeless population has previously stayed in an institutional setting, mostly in youth care (48.7%), psychiatric (34.4%) and penitentiary (33.1%) institutions. Moreover, the share of homeless people with a history in one of these institutions has increased in the past decades. Institution leavers, face at least three obstacles to a stable housing situation in Flanders: a lack of affordable housing, a lack of access to (non-residential) social assistance and personal difficulties in coping with living independently. Yet, there are several programs that support institution leavers and prepare them for the transition to an independent living situation and legal developments that strengthen their position in society and on the housing market. In this paper, we explore these initiatives and developments in three case studies (Antwerp, Ghent and Leuven). Based on in-depth interviews with “street-level bureaucrats” who work in these institutions (youth care, psychiatric and penitentiary settings), social support services and social housing organizations, we reconstruct the pathways of institution leavers to the housing market, the support they receive and the experienced difficulties. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,J.

Food insufficiency is associated with depression among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting,"Goldman-Hasbun, J.; Nosova, E.; Debeck, K.; Dahlby, L.; Kerr, T.","Objective Food insufficiency, defined by the experience of hunger, is known to be prevalent and a source of health-related harm among-street involved youth, but little is known about its relationship with depression in this population. Therefore, we sought to assess the association between food insufficiency and symptoms of depression among a cohort of street-involved youth.Design Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between food insufficiency, defined as being hungry but not having enough money to buy food, and depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.Setting Data from April 2006 to November 2013 were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada.Subjects There were 1066 street-involved youth enrolled in the study, including 340 (31·9 %) females.Results Of 1066 youth enrolled in the study, 724 (67·9 %) reported some food insufficiency and 565 (53·0 %) met criteria for depression. Compared with youth who did not report food insufficiency, those who reported often experiencing food insufficiency had a higher likelihood of reporting depression (adjusted OR=2·52; 95 % CI 1·74, 3·67), as did those who reported sometimes experiencing food insufficiency (adjusted OR=1·99; 95 % CI 1·47, 2·70).Conclusions Food insufficiency was prevalent and associated in a dose-dependent trend with symptoms of depression among street-involved youth in our setting. Findings highlight the need to address the nutritional and mental health needs of youth and identify pathways by which food insufficiency may contribute to depression among vulnerable populations. © The Authors 2018.",2019,,Public Health Nutr.,22,1,115-121,,10.1017/S1368980018002574,,#2590,Goldman-Hasbun 2019,,
How to stop violence among homeless: Extension of voter model and intervention strategies,"Srivastava, A.; Petering, R.; Kannan, R.; Rice, E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Interventions to reduce violence among homeless youth are difficult to implement due to the complex nature of violence. However, a peer-based intervention approach would likely be a worthy approach as it has been shown that individuals who interact with more violent individuals are more likely to be violent, suggesting a contagious nature of violence. We propose Uncertain Voter Model to represent the complex process of diffusion of violence over a social network, that captures uncertainties in links and time over which the diffusion of violence takes place. Assuming this model, we define Violence Minimization problem where the task is to select a predefined number of individuals for intervention so that the expected number of violent individuals in the network is minimized over a given time-frame. We extend the problem to a probabilistic setting, where the success probability of converting an individual into non-violent is a function of the number of 'units' of intervention performed on them. We provide algorithms for finding the optimal intervention strategies for both scenarios. We demonstrate that our algorithms perform significantly better than interventions based on popular centrality measures in terms of reducing violence. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,"Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2018",,,83-86,,10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508641,,#2592,Srivastava 2018,,
Methodological reflections on research with street youth,"Karabanow, J.; Kidd, S.; Frederick, T.; McLuckie, A.; Quick, J.","Summary: This paper examines both the epistemological and practical limitations and challenges of data collection by reflecting on the experiences of a team of both junior and senior researchers engaged in such a longitudinal study.

Correlates of shelter use among young adults experiencing homelessness,"Yoonsook, H.; Thomas, M.M.C.; Narendorf, S.C.; Maria, D.S.","Rates of shelter use among young adults (ages 18–24) experiencing homelessness are disproportionally low, compared to youth or older adults experiencing homelessness. The high unsheltered rate exposes these young adults to significant short- and long-term risks, while shelter use is associated with positive and improved outcomes, including increased access to other supportive services. Few studies have focused on factors related to low rates of shelter use among young adults or on the relative importance of such factors. The present study examines a series of background and contextual factors that are associated with shelter use among young adults experiencing homelessness. Using survey data (n = 338) collected in Houston, Texas, this study employs multiple logistic regression to examine correlates of shelter use and to assess the relative importance of each factor. Results indicate several significant characteristics were positively associated with shelter use, including being female, being non-white, using other types of services, and Internet use.

Innovative treatment options used to support and affirm an individual's preferred gender identity can help resolve gender dysphoria and avoid many negative sequelae of nontreatment. Yet, despite advances in these relatively novel treatment options, which appear to be highly effective in addressing gender dysphoria and mitigating associated adverse outcomes, ethical challenges abound in ensuring that young patients receive appropriate, safe, affordable treatment and that access to this treatment is fair and equitable. Ethical considerations in gender-affirming care for TGNC youth span concerns about meeting the obligations to maximize treatment benefit to patients (beneficence), minimizing harm (nonmaleficence), supporting autonomy for pediatric patients during a time of rapid development, and addressing justice, including equitable access to care for TGNC youth. Moreover, although available data describing the use of gender-affirming treatment options are encouraging, and the risks of not treating TGNC youth with gender dysphoria are evident, little is known about the long-term effects of both hormonal and surgical interventions in this population. To support ethical decision-making about treatment options, we encourage the development of a comprehensive registry in the United States to track long-term patient outcomes. In the meantime, providers who work with TGNC youth and their families should endeavor to offer ethically sound, patient-centered, gender-affirming care based on the best currently available evidence. © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",2018,,Pediatrics,142,6,,,10.1542/peds.2018-1537,,#2596,Kimberly 2018,,

From 2011 to 2012, we surveyed 274 recent attendees of balls in the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on social networks, social support, and HIV-related behaviours. Participants with a high percentage of alters who were supportive of HIV testing were significantly more likely to have tested in the past six months (p =.02), and less likely to have engaged in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past three months (p =.003). Multivariate regression analyses of social network characteristics, and social support, revealed that testing in the past six months was significantly associated with social support for safer sex, instrumental social support, and age. Similarly, UAI in the past three months was significantly associated with social support for safer sex, homophily based on sexual identity and HIV status.

Please be an influencer? Contingency-aware influence maximization,"Yadav, A.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Noothigattu, R.; Marcolino, L.S.; Rice, E.; Tambe, M.","Most previous work on influence maximization in social networks assumes that the chosen influencers (or seed nodes) can be influenced with certainty (i.e., with no contingencies). In this paper, we focus on using influence maximization in public health domains for assisting low-resource communities, where contingencies are common. It is very difficult in these domains to ensure that the seed nodes are influenced, as influencing them entails contacting/convincing them to attend training sessions, which may not always be possible. Unfortunately, previous state-of-the-art algorithms for influence maximization are unusable in this setting. This paper tackles this challenge via the following four contributions: (i) we propose the Contingency Aware Influence Maximization problem and analyze it theoretically; (ii) we cast this problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and propose CAIMS (a novel POMDP planner) to solve it, which leverages a natural action space factorization associated with real-world social networks; and (iii) we provide extensive simulation results to compare CAIMS with existing state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms.

Current evidence demonstrates that the rate of HCV infection among Indigenous people is at least five times higher than the rest of Canada. This analysis provides a reconciliatory response, which exposes the colonial etiology of the HCV gap in Canada and proposes potential anti-colonial approaches to HCV wellness and health care for Indigenous people. Methods: This analysis applies Two-Eyed Seeing as a reconciliatory methodology to advance the understanding of HCV burden and identify the key elements of responsive HCV care in the context of Indigenous nations in Canada. Results: The analysis underlines the colonial distribution of HCV burden in Canada, highlights Indigenous perspectives on HCV infection, hypothesizes a clinical pathway for the underlying colonial etiology of HCV infection, and identifies Indigenous healing as a promising anti-colonial conceptual approach to HCV wellness and health care among Indigenous people. Conclusions: In the eyes of Indigenous people, HCV infection is a colonial illness that entails healing as an anti-colonial approach to achieving wellness and gaining health. Future empirical research should elaborate on the colonial HCV pathway hypothesis and inform the development of a framework for HCV healing among Indigenous people in Canada. © 2018, University of Toronto Press Inc.

Can Machine Learning Create an Advocate for Foster Youth?,"Brindley, M.; Heyes, J.P.; Booker, D.","Statistics are bleak for youth aging out of the United States foster care system. They are often left with few resources, are likely to experience homelessness, and are at increased risk of incarceration and exploitation. The Think of Us platform is a service for foster youth and their advocates to create personalized goals and access curated content specific to aging out of the foster care system. In this article, we propose the use of a machine learning algorithm within the Think of Us platform to better serve youth transitioning to life outside of foster care. The algorithm collects and collates publicly available figures and data to inform caseworkers and other mentors chosen by the youth on how to best assist foster youth. It can then provide valuable resources for the youth and their advocates targeted directly toward their specific needs. Finally, we examine machine learning as a support system and aid for caseworkers to buttress and protect vulnerable young adults during their transition to adulthood. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,J.

Understanding the Link between Victimization and Alcohol Use among Homeless Youth Using Ecological Momentary Assessment,"Tyler, K.A.; Olson, K.; Ray, C.M.","Most prior research on victimization and alcohol use among homeless youth is retrospective and thus does not allow researchers to determine the sequencing of these events. We address this gap using ecological momentary assessment via short message service surveying with homeless youth during 30 days. Multilevel binary logistic regression results revealed that experiencing physical or sexual victimization on a specific day was positively associated with youth’s drinking alcohol later that day. Because ecological momentary assessment via short message service allows for such specificity, we can link a specific victimization experience with a current drinking episode. Thus, the time ordering of daily events in the current study is a significant improvement over prior research. Understanding the timing between victimization and drinking alcohol is also important for intervention with this underserved population. © The Author(s) 2018.",2018,,Socius,4,,,,10.1177/2378023118779832,,#2613,Tyler 2018,,
Adaptive behavior of sheltered homeless children in the French ENFAMS survey,"Darbeda, S.; Falissard, B.; Orri, M.; Barry, C.; Melchior, M.; Chauvin, P.; Vandentorren, S.","Objectives. To describe the adaptive behaviors in a large sample of homeless children and identify factors associated with developmental delay. Methods. Data were from a cross-sectional survey of 557 children younger than 6 years randomly sampled among homeless sheltered families in the Paris region, France (January–May 2013). An interviewer and a psychologist conducted face-to-face interviews to collect information on sociodemographic and health characteristics. We assessed adaptive behaviors using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II). Results. The mean VABS-II composite score (SD) was 75.4 (12.0), and most participating children (80.9%) were considered developmentally delayed. Characteristics negatively associated with children’s developmental score were age, birth in a country other than France, low birth weight, and past-year hospitalization. Conclusions. There is a high prevalence of developmental delays among children growing up homeless. Public Health Implications. Long-term integrated programs improving parenting and children’s opportunities for stimulation and socialization should be developed in daycare centers, schools, shelters, and medical practices to minimize negative effects of early living conditions on children’s development. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

"Patterns of Non-injection Drug Use Associated with Injection Cessation among Street-Involved Youth in Vancouver, Canada","Lake, S.; Kerr, T.; Nosova, E.; Milloy, M.-J.; Wood, E.; DeBeck, K.","Although abstinence from drug use is often a key goal of youth substance use treatment, transitioning to less harmful routes and types of drug use is desirable from both a clinical and public health perspective. Despite this, little is known about the trajectories of youth who inject drugs including changes in patterns of non-injection drug use. The At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) is a longitudinal cohort of street-involved youth who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. We used linear growth curve modeling to compare changes in non-injection drug use among participants who ceased injecting drugs for at least one 6-month period between September 2005 and May 2015 to matched controls who continued injecting over the same period. Of 387 eligible participants, 173 (44.7%) reported ceasing drug injection at least once. Non-injection drug use occurred during 160 (79.6%) periods of injection cessation. In adjusted linear growth curve analyses, the only non-injection drug use pattern observed to decrease significantly more than controls following injection cessation was daily crack/cocaine use (p = 0.024). With the exception of frequent crack/cocaine use, transitions out of injection drug use did not appear to coincide with increased reductions in patterns of non-injection drug use. Our findings indicate that most (80%) of the observed injection cessation events occurred in the context of ongoing substance use. Given that transitioning out of drug injection represents a significant reduction in risk and harm, efforts supporting vulnerable youth to move away from injecting may benefit from approaches that allow for ongoing non-injection drug use. © 2017, The New York Academy of Medicine.",2018,,Urban Health,95,2,267-277,,10.1007/s11524-017-0225-3,,#2616,Lake 2018,,

Methods: We utilized concept mapping methodology to facilitate engagement with diverse stakeholders-more than 300 community members and service providers-with a focus on hard to reach populations. Key informant interviews with service providers were used to augment findings. Results: Participants identified 48 unique services or service approaches they believed would improve the health of residents in the area, including those addressing health care, mental health and addictions, youth, families, people experiencing homelessness, seniors, general social services, and services targeting specific populations. While service providers consistently identified a critical need for mental health and addiction services, community members placed greater importance on the social determinants of health including access to housing, job placement supports and training and service accessibility. Both groups agreed that services and programs for seniors and people experiencing homelessness would be highly important. Conclusion: Our study provides a unique example of using concept mapping as a tool to aid a rapid service gap analysis and community engagement in a metropolitan area.

Unaccompanied youth and private-public order failures,"Woods, J.B.","Each year, approximately 1.7 million ""unaccompanied youth"" under the age of 18 live on their own in homelessness or in other unstable living conditions. Many of these youth ran away or were kicked out of their families or child welfare placements. Others became homeless upon or soon after being released from juvenile detention. As this Article describes, the government responds to unaccompanied youth through a complex web of family-centered interventions in both the child welfare and the juvenile justice systems. Child welfare responses adopt a view of unaccompanied youth as victims of negative family circumstances and respond by altering their family environments-first through attempting to repair the biological family relationship, and when that is not possible, by providing youth substitute families through foster care and adoption. When those family-centered approaches are not working, juvenile justice laws and law enforcement policies and practices pressure unaccompanied youth to reunite with their families (whether biological, foster, or adoptive) and allow for their arrest and detention. In this regard, the government adopts a very different view of unaccompanied youth as delinquent offenders when they do not fit into family systems. This Article shows that unaccompanied youth whose needs are not served under family-centered child welfare responses are ultimately left vulnerable to entering a destructive cycle of homelessness and involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. It further argues that the experiences of unaccompanied youth, and unaccompanied LGBTQ youth in particular, demonstrate the limits of the family-centered approach as a wholesale or comprehensive solution to the child welfare needs of adolescent youth. The shortcomings of this approach illustrate a need for a paradigm shift in child welfare law and policy (and relatedly, juvenile justice law and policy) that places greater emphasis on non-family-centered approaches to serve vulnerable youth in need of help from the state, especially late-adolescent youth. Under this new framework, child welfare law and policy responses would conceptualize the agency and autonomy of unaccompanied youth in positive and empowering terms, and provide greater space for support systems, skills, and resources outside of family systems to help them achieve self-reliance and self-actualization as adults. © 2018 University of Iowa.

"Incarceration history, social network composition, and substance use among homeless youth in Los Angeles","Zhao, Q.; Kim, B.K.E.; Li, W.; Hsiao, H.-Y.; Rice, E.","Background: Homeless youth in the United States have high rates of substance use. Existing research has identified social network composition and street-associated stressors as contributing factors. Incarceration is a highly prevalent stressor for homeless youth. Its effect on youth’s social network composition and substance use, however, has been neglected. Aims: This study investigated the direct and indirect associations between incarceration history and substance use (through social networks) among homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Methods: A sample of 1047 homeless youths were recruited between 2011 and 2013. Computerized self-administrated surveys and social network interviews were conducted to collect youth’s sociodemographic characteristics, incarceration history, social network composition, and substance use. Bootstrapping was used to identify the direct and indirect associations between youth’s incarceration history and substance use. Results: Incarceration history was positively associated with youth’s cannabis, methamphetamine, and injection drug use. The percentage of cannabis-using peers partially mediated the associations between incarceration history and youth’s cannabis, cocaine, and heroin use. The percentage of methamphetamine-using peers partially mediated the associations between incarceration history and youth's methamphetamine, cocaine, and injection drug use. The percentage of heroin-using peers partially mediated the association between incarceration history and youth’s heroin use. Moreover, the percentage of peers who inject drugs partially mediated the associations between incarceration history and youth’s methamphetamine, heroin, and injection drug use. Discussion: Incarceration history should be taken to a more central place in future research and practice with homeless youth in the United States. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,J.

This study examines the comparative efficacy of 2 interventions—Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS)—provided to homeless youth with mental illness in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Participants were recruited from 1 homeless youth agency in Los Angeles, CA, and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received 4 SEI components, and IPS participants received IPS services based on 8 principles. Data were collected at baseline and follow-up for the primary employment outcome (paid employment) and 5 secondary employment outcomes. Results: Over 20 months, 39% of SEI participants and 32% of IPS participants reported any paid employment. Across both groups, participants who reported working at baseline had nearly 8 times the odds of working at follow-up (OR = 7.91, p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected across the full sample or between groups on the primary or secondary employment outcomes. Conclusions: Future effectiveness research is needed to compare the long-term employment outcomes of the SEI and IPS with a more heterogeneous sample of homeless youth using customized homelessness support services and more nuanced employment outcomes. © 2018 by the Society for Social Work and Research.

Tracking the gendered life courses of care leavers in 19th-Century Britain,"Cox, P.; Shore, H.; Alker, Z.; Godfrey, B.","The adult outcomes of children raised in care are a matter of much concern in Britain today. Care leavers account for a quarter of the adult prison population, a tenth of the young homeless population, and over two thirds of sex workers (Centre for Social Justice, 2015: 4). This article argues that, by contrast, the first generation of boys and girls passing through the early care system were more likely to have experienced a modest improvement in their life chances. It explores three key questions. First, what mechanisms shaped adult outcomes of care in the past? Second, did these vary by gender? Third, what might life course approaches to these issues gain from engaging both with historical- and gender-inflected analysis? The article draws on our wider analysis of the life courses and life chances of 400 adults who passed through the early youth justice and care systems as children in the northwest of England from the 1860s to the 1920s. These systems were closely interlinked. Within that, the article focuses on the experiences of a subgroup sent to a more care-oriented institution. It compares their collective outcomes with those of the wider group and within-group by gender. It offers a selection of case studies of women’s lives before and after care to highlight the value of, and challenges involved in, undertaking gender analysis in life course research of this kind. © 2018, Society for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies.

Employment and Other Income Sources Among Homeless Youth,"Slesnick, N.; Zhang, J.; Yilmazer, T.","Homeless youth report high rates of unemployment. While homeless serving agencies usually offer employment services, most homeless youth are disengaged from homeless service agencies, and a limited number of studies have examined employment and other income sources among service disconnected youth. Our study examined income sources and change in income among service disconnected youth, all of whom received Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA, N = 79). Findings revealed that over time employment and legal income from non-survival behaviors increased (e.g., governmental assistance and receiving income from friends and relatives), while income from survival behaviors decreased (e.g., prostitution, stealing, selling possessions, selling blood or plasma). Although unemployment among these youth remained high (62%), income from survival behaviors reduced most drastically. Findings also suggest that employment is linked to housing stability and mental health, as is substance use and income, which suggests that mental health, housing, and substance use treatment services are important components in income stabilization for homeless youth. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018,,J.

Preventing Homelessness for System-Involved Youth,"Britton, L.; Pilnik, L.","Too many youth and young adults find themselves on the streets, couch-surfing with friends, in emergency shelters or worse, after exiting the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. In some circumstances, youth have had court hearings until their exit from the legal system, but those hearings have not focused on long-range plans of youth and emergencies youth may encounter. In other circumstances, there has been little or no planning prior to discharge, especially for young people who leave the juvenile justice system. Courts can and should prevent, alleviate or end youth homelessness for youth who appear before them through strategies that are enumerated in the recently-passed NCJFCJ resolution. This article expounds on three of these strategies – coordinating transition and re-entry plans, insisting on effective legal representation of youth, and utilizing sound judicial leadership.

Following a brief review of the fundamental aspects of PAR, key developments in the field are examined. These developments include the redefinition of the research enterprise among groups such as Indigenous and consumer/survivor communities, challenges that attend the “project” framing of PAR, academic and practice context challenges, and important domains in which PAR methods need to become more engaged (e.g., social media and disenfranchised youth). Three illustrative case studies of programs of work in the areas of youth homelessness, consumer/survivor engagement, and Indigenous research are provided to illustrate these contemporary challenges and opportunities in the field.

Psychological distress and psychopathological dimensions of adolescents experiencing difficulties in Kinshasa,"Ndjukendi, A.; Okitundu, D.; Mpaka, D.; N'situ, A.; Lukeba, T.; Imbula, B.; Nkiluvuidi, N.; Kupelesa, M.; Ngoma, V.; Moro, M.-R.; Falissard, B.","Context: In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the management of psychosocial problems of adolescents is confronted with phenomena of resistance and poorly-elucidated recurrence. In addition, the distress and the associated psychopathological dimensions are not integrated. Objectives: The first objective was to assess the level of psychological distress of adolescents facing problems of early pregnancy and motherhood, antisocial behavior, drug abuse, maltreatment, witchcraft, street children. The second objective was to determine the psychopathological dimensions such as somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, obsession-compulsion, anxiety, paranoid ideation, hostility, phobic anxiety and psychotic traits associated with psychosocial problems of adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 66 adolescents experiencing difficulties (27 boys and 39 girls) aged 17.53 (± 2.33) years in the health zone of Masina 2, between May and October 2010. The global severity index of psychological distress and psychopathological dimensions were assessed by a mental health tool, the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Kruskal–Wallis, Tukey–Kramer and multiple correspondence analyzes were used to analyze the variables with P < 0.05. Results: The global severity index varied according to psychopathological dimensions (P < 0.0001) and psychosocial problems (P = 0.001). The average score was 0.92. The significant differences in average scores were observed between firstly abuse and addiction, for which the scores were higher, and other antisocial behavior, street children, early pregnancies and motherhood and witchcraft (P < 0.0001). Interpersonal sensitivity was the most common dimension, and each psychosocial problem presented a preponderant psychopathological dimension. Conclusion: This study allowed the characterization of psychic suffering and mental health related to psychosocial problems of adolescents in Kinshasa.

"The Relative Influence of Injunctive and Descriptive Social Norms on Methamphetamine, Heroin, and Injection Drug Use Among Homeless Youths: The Impact of Different Referent Groups","Barman-Adhikari, A.; Craddock, J.; Bowen, E.; Das, R.; Rice, E.","The current study assessed the relative influence of both injunctive and descriptive norms in the context of different referent groups (i.e., family, street peers, home-based peers, and staff members) on past 30-day methamphetamine, heroin, and injection drug use behaviors of homeless youth. Cross-sectional data (N = 911) were collected from three drop-in centers in Los Angeles, California. The study consisted of two parts: a social network interview and a computerized self-administered survey. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the association of objection to drug use from referent groups (injunctive norms; that is, street-based peers, home-based peers, relatives, staff members) and drug use of referent groups (descriptive norms) with youths’ substance use behaviors. Multivariate results indicated that the role of injunctive and descriptive norms varied across the three substance use behaviors and by referent group. Findings indicate the need to carefully consider the diversity of homeless youths’ networks in designing substance use interventions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",2018,,J.

Emotional health among youth experiencing family homelessness,"Barnes, A.J.; Gilbertson, J.; Chatterjee, D.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Youth who are homeless with adult family members comprise 37% of the US homeless population, yet mental health among this group has not yet been well described. We aimed to compare the risk of suicidality, and factors that may protect against it, between family-homeless and nonhomeless youth. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data, representing 62 034 eighth-to 12th-graders, to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of emotional distress, self-injury, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide in the past 12 months for youth who experienced family homelessness in the past 12 months compared with housed youth, controlling for covariates. We then tested whether developmental assets moderated these outcomes. RESULTS: Four percent (n = 4594) of youth (mean age 14.9 years) were homeless with an adult family member. Among these, 29.1% (n = 1317; aOR: 2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.34-2.69) reported self-injury, 21% (n = 940; aOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 2.14-2.48) reported suicidal ideation, and 9.3% (n = 416; aOR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.91-3.60) reported suicide attempts. Developmental assets decreased the odds of these outcomes for all youth but were less protective for homeless youth. CONCLUSIONS: Youth experiencing recent family homelessness are at higher risk of suicidality than their nonhomeless peers, suggesting homelessness itself as a marker of risk. Factors that protect emotional health are less impactful among youth experiencing recent family homelessness. Thus, interventions among homeless youth may need to address social determinants of health such as stable housing and adversity in addition to developmental assets. © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",2018,,Pediatrics,141,4,,,10.1542/peds.2017-1767,,#2657,Barnes 2018,,
The experiences of adolescents and young adults residing with their families in emergency shelters in canada,"Polillo, A.; Sylvestre, J.; Kerman, N.; Lee, C.M.; Aubry, T.; Czechowski, K.","Emergency homeless shelters can be stressful environments for families. They can be associated with emotional distress and feelings of restriction for parents, and with behavioural, social, and developmental challenges for children. However, little is known about the experiences of accompanied youth residing in shelter with their families, as the literature about this age group’s experiences of homelessness has mainly focused on unaccompanied youth. Findings from the current study are drawn from qualitative interviews with 16 adolescents and young adults (aged 16–21) who were homeless and living with their families in family homeless shelters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Youth described family homeless shelters as stressful environments but also found that the shelters provided support to them and their families. Youth discussed the various strategies they used to cope in facing the challenges of shelter life. These findings add to our understanding of youth who are homeless and highlight the ways in which they adapt to the challenges of living in a family homeless shelter with their families. Recommendations are included for ways that shelter staff and policymakers can enact operational and systemic changes that could potentially improve the experiences of such youth and their families. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,J.

When structural violences create a context that facilitates sexual assault and intimate partner violence against street-involved young women,"Flynn, C.; Damant, D.; Lapierre, S.; Lessard, G.; Gagnon, C.; Couturier, V.; Couturier, P.","This article presents findings from a participatory action research project conducted with a group of seven street-involved young women in the urban area of Quebec City (Canada). The objective of this research was to explore their experiences of homelessness through the lens of structural violence. Structural violence is the process through which social inequalities are produced. The data gathered through five focus groups revealed the presence of two gendered patterns of structural violence: social exclusion and social control. These two processes reinforce each other in a cycle. Indeed, the participants' strategies to overcome social exclusion and to fulfill their basic needs made them vulnerable to social control. In turn, social control had increased their financial difficulties and their fear of exclusion. These two processes of structural violence had also created contexts that facilitate sexual victimization and intimate partner violence. © 2018",2018,,Women's Stud. Int.

Safe Cities and Queer Spaces: The Urban Politics of Radical LGBT Activism,"Goh, K.","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) visibility is at a high. Gay marriage is a reality. Gay urban enclaves are threatened by their own success, historic icons of the movement subsumed by urban development. Yet violence and homelessness continue, and socioeconomic disparities are reinforced in LGBT communities, particularly among women, people of color, young and old, and gender-nonconforming. Overlapping identities and systems of oppression exacerbate the marginalization of LGBT-identified people, creating “unjust geographies” that intertwine race, class, gender, and sexuality. These queer struggles play out in gay centers and in urban areas far from those. How might researchers understand the complex and intersectional nature of queer marginalization in urban space today, situated within multiple modes of social and spatial oppression? How might those involved in the envisioning and making of cities contribute to the social movements still fighting for change and justice? Building on theories of critical geography and queer theory, this article explores the organizing work of queer activist organizations in two New York City neighborhoods, including the author's participatory role as a designer and activist: FIERCE's campaign for a queer youth center in the West Village and the Audre Lorde Project's safe neighborhood campaign in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Through an analysis of the strategies, politics, and spatial implications of such work, the article delineates the ways in which queer community organizers on the ground are fighting for social and spatial change, outside and despite dominant economic and sociopolitical structures. © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.",2018,,Ann.

Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were used to assess the impact of age at homelessness onset, current age, age at first sex, and HIV risk perceptions on having condomless sex, new sexual partner(s), and multiple sexual partners (≥4 sexual partners) in the past 12 months. Individuals who first experienced homelessness by age 24 were significantly more likely to report condomless sex and multiple sexual partners in the past year than those who had a later onset of their first episode of homelessness. Individuals who were currently 24 years or younger were more likely to have had condomless sex, new sexual partners, and multiple sexual partners in the past 12 months than those who were 25 years or older. Those who had low perceived HIV risk had lower odds of all three sexual risk behaviors.

A qualitative study of smoking cessation experiences and perceptions among homeless young adults,"Mullins, L.; O’Hanlon, C.E.; Shadel, W.G.; Tucker, J.S.","Up to 70% of homeless youth smoke, but there is little information available on their smoking cessation experiences and perceptions to guide cessation intervention efforts. This study examined reasons for quitting smoking, previous experiences quitting smoking, and preferences for smoking cessation programs among homeless young adults. Four focus groups (N = 27) were conducted in centers serving homeless 18–25 year olds in Los Angeles. Sessions were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by a systematic procedure for qualitative analysis to identify key themes on the topics of interest. The short-term health-related consequences of smoking and high cost of cigarettes were the main reasons participants indicated for quitting or wanting to quit. In terms of barriers to quitting, exposure to peers who smoke and smoking to cope with the daily stressors of homelessness were the two most salient themes. Suggested features of a smoking cessation program for homeless youth included having a group-based component to provide support, offering incentives to attend, and using “scare tactics” as a tool to increase motivation to quit. To increase acceptability and uptake, smoking cessation programs for homeless youth need to focus on the short-term consequences of smoking and harness of the power of peer influences. © 2017 The RAND Corporation.

"Non-participation in education, employment, and training among young people accessing youth mental health services: Demographic and clinical correlates","Holloway, E.M.; Rickwood, D.; Rehm, I.C.; Meyer, D.; Griffiths, S.; Telford, N.","Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate participation in employment, education, or training among a national cohort of young people presenting to youth-specific mental health services across Australia, and identify the key demographic and clinical correlates of non-participation. Method: Clinician and self-reported demographic and clinical characteristics were ascertained for 57,644 young people aged 15–25 years presenting to a national youth-specific mental health service between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2015, including level of participation in education, employment, or training in four categories (not participating, not in the labour force, partial participation, and full participation). Results: The results showed that these young people are very vulnerable to non-participation in employment, education or training. Characteristics most strongly associated with non-participation were being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, male, homeless, diagnosed with a substance use disorder, or having a neurodevelopmental disorder in young adulthood. Discussion: The results extend understanding of the major risk factors associated with non-participation in employment, education, or training for help-seeking young people. Distinct patterns emerged across the three non-participation groups suggesting that support must be tailored to individual needs. Supporting those who experience mental illness to re-engage is essential to buffer against the long-term impacts.

Hair concentration of trace elements and growth in homeless children aged < 6 years: Results from the ENFAMS study,"Fábelová, L.; Vandentorren, S.; Vuillermoz, C.; Garnier, R.; Lioret, S.; Botton, J.","Background: Growth is an important indicator of health in early childhood. This is a critical developmental period, during which a number of factors, including exposure to metals, might play a role in later physical and metabolic functions. Objective: To study the association between exposure to arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se), and physical growth of children from homeless families aged < 6 years. Methods: This study was based on data of the cross-sectional survey (ENFAMS), which was conducted by the Observatoire du Samu Social on a random sample of homeless sheltered families in the Paris region during winter 2013. Families with children under 6 years (N = 324) were interviewed in 17 languages using face-to-face questionnaires. A nurse took anthropometric measures and collected hair samples where As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Se levels were measured. We calculated weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) and BMI-for-age Z-score (BMIZ) of children, using the 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards as a reference. Associations between ln-transformed metal exposures and growth outcomes were tested by multivariable linear regression models with adjustment for potential confounders (including maternal anthropometrical and socio-demographical characteristics, gestational age, child birthweight, breastfeeding, food insecurity of the child). Due to missing data (1.6% to 14.2% depending on the variables), we used multiple imputation by chained equations. Results: A strong positive correlation was found between Pb and Cd levels (r = 0.65; p < 0.001). Positive associations between Se level and HAZ (β = 0.61; p = 0.05) and between Cd and BMIZ (β = 0.21; p = 0.03) and negative associations between As and HAZ (β = − 0.18; p = 0.05) were no more significant after multiple imputation. A weak negative trend was observed between Cd and HAZ (β = − 0.14; p = 0.14), while positive trends were found between Se and both WAZ (β = 0.55; p = 0.10) and HAZ (β = 0.51; p = 0.06) after multiple imputation. Conclusion: Overall, our results found no strong association between exposure to metals and physical growth of homeless children but we observed some trends that were consistent with previous studies. More research is required studying these associations longitudinally, along with higher sample sizes, for better understanding the sources of exposure in homeless population and the potential effects on growth. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Environ.

Serving Former Foster Youth and Homeless Students in College,"Huang, H.; Fernandez, S.; Rhoden, M.-A.; Joseph, R.","Many universities have developed campus support programs for former foster youth and homeless college students; however, there are no studies focusing on long-term programs in the college-setting with a mentoring component that focuses on developing relationships with supportive adults. To address the gap, this study examined both mentors' and program staff's experience with providing services to students in a campus support program. The authors collected qualitative data from one success coach (i.e. program staff) and eight mentors through focus group meetings and interviews. Results indicated that the success coach reported the students in the program improved their overall academic performance, while most mentors did not know their mentees' grades. The success coach coordinated most services of the program, assigned financial and academic support, and made service referrals. Mentors helped their mentees to improve academic and independent living skills. However, mentors reported that they received limited support, especially when working with mentees with mental health problems. Recommendations to improve the program include: using a multidisciplinary team for students with mental health problems and adopting systematic approaches to better support mentors' services. Future studies should go beyond program staff and mentors to include students' perspectives regarding their experiences with receiving mentoring services. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,J.

A pilot test of a motivational interviewing social network intervention to reduce substance use among housing first residents,"Kennedy, D.P.; Osilla, K.C.; Hunter, S.B.; Golinelli, D.; Maksabedian Hernandez, E.; Tucker, J.S.","This article presents findings of a pilot test of a Motivational Interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) to enhance motivation to reduce high risk alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to housing. Delivered in-person by a facilitator trained in MI, this four-session computer-assisted intervention provides personalized social network visualization feedback to help participants understand the people in their network who trigger their alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and those who support abstinence. If ready, participants are encouraged to make changes to their social network to help reduce their own high-risk behavior. Participants were 41 individuals (33 male, 7 female, 1 other; 23 African-American, 5 non-Latino White, 6 Latino, 7 other, mean age 48) who were transitioning from homelessness to permanent supportive housing. They were randomly assigned to either the MI-SNI condition or usual care. Readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use were assessed at baseline and shortly after the final intervention session for the MI-SNI arm and around 3-months after baseline for the control arm. Acceptability of the intervention was also evaluated. MI-SNI participants reported increased readiness to change AOD use compared to control participants. We also conducted a subsample analysis for participants at one housing program and found a significant intervention effect on readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and alcohol use compared to control participants. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable. We conclude that a brief computer-assisted Motivational Interviewing social network intervention has potential to efficaciously impact readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing, and warrants future study in larger clinical trials. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2018,,J.

Fifteen face-to-face interviews were conducted with 10 I-Care employees and 5 former street children. A focus group was set up with I-Care employees. Although existing literature is forthright about a generalist approach for children at risk, it remains unclear how to implement this approach in practice.

Youth Experiences Survey (YES): Exploring the Scope and Complexity of Sex Trafficking in a Sample of Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Middleton, J.S.; Gattis, M.N.; Frey, L.M.; Roe-Sepowitz, D.","In the United States, sex trafficking victims have been identified at ages across the lifespan but young persons (under age 25) have been found to have unique vulnerabilities. At-risk youth, such as those who run away from home or those experiencing homelessness, are also at an increased risk of sexual exploitation. To better understand the scope and complexity of sex trafficking among these at-risk youth, a convenience sample of 131 homeless youth aged 12 to 25 years old experiencing homelessness recruited from Kentuckiana youth service providers completed an enhanced version of the Youth Experiences Survey (YES). Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted. Results indicated that 41.2% of the homeless youth were victims of sex trafficking. The sex trafficked youth were more likely to report previous self-harm behaviors, suicide attempts, and substance use. This study not only provides support for improved service delivery, but also provides essential statistics that should inform internal policy and procedures for youth serving agencies in Kentucky and Indiana. Findings highlight a need for trauma-informed interventions designed to treat not only females but also males and LGBTQ youth. Additionally, service providers should consider partnering with victim providers and clinicians to offer therapeutic groups, individual therapy, and supportive services that increase prevention, education, and wraparound care for clients. In regards to future research, findings point towards a need to better understand the role that trauma and adverse childhood experiences may play in making young people vulnerable to sex trafficking, and encourage the need for testing prevention and early intervention practices among vulnerable youth. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,J.

Internet and social media access among youth experiencing homelessness: Mixed-methods study,"Houdek VonHoltz, L.A.; Frasso, R.; Golinkoff, J.M.; Lozano, A.J.; Hanlon, A.; Dowshen, N.","Background: Youth experiencing homelessness are at a risk for a variety of adverse outcomes. Given the widespread use of the internet and social media, these new technologies may be used to address their needs and for outreach purposes. However, little is known about how this group uses these resources. Objective: This study investigated how homeless adolescents use these technologies for general and health-related purposes, whether the scope of their use changes with housing status, and their interest in a website dedicated to youth experiencing homelessness. Methods: A convenience sample of youth aged 18 to 21 years was recruited from a youth-specific homeless shelter. All participants completed a 47-item survey, with 10 individuals completing a semistructured interview. Descriptive statistics, exact testing, logistic regression, and generalized estimating equation modeling was performed for quantitative data analysis. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and NVivo 10 (QSR International) was employed to facilitate double coding and thematic analysis. Results: A total of 87 participants completed the survey with a mean age of 19.4 (SD 1.1) years. While experiencing homelessness, 56% (49/87) accessed the internet at least once a day, with 86% (75/87) accessing once a week. Access to a smartphone was associated with a 3.03 greater odds of accessing the internet and was the most frequently used device (66% of participants, 57/87). While experiencing homelessness, subjects reported a 68% decreased odds in internet access frequency (odds ratio [OR] 0.32, P<.001), 75% decreased odds in spending greater amounts of time on the internet (OR 0.25, P<.001), and an 87% decreased odds of social media use (OR 0.13, P=.01).

Several themes were identified, including (1) changes in internet behaviors while experiencing homelessness, (2) health status as a major concern and reason for Internet use, and (3) interest in a website dedicated to youth experiencing homelessness. While experiencing homelessness, participants indicated their behaviors were more goal-oriented and less focused on leisure or entertainment activities. Conclusions: While homeless youth experience changes in the frequency, amount of time, and specific uses of the internet and social media, study participants were able to access the internet regularly. The internet was used to search health-related topics. Given the importance of smartphones in accessing the internet, mobile-optimized websites may be an effective method for reaching this group. © Lauren A Houdek VonHoltz, Rosemary Frasso, Jesse M Golinkoff, Alicia J Lozano, Alexandra Hanlon, Nadia Dowshen.",2018,,J.

Daybreak in Dayton: Assessing characteristics and outcomes of previously homeless youth living in transitional housing,"Pierce, S.C.; Grady, B.; Holtzen, H.","Each year, more than 1 million American children and youth experience homelessness (Hammer, Finkelhor, & Sedlak, 2002; Office of Applied Studies, 2004). The transient nature of this population makes it difficult to study, but youth homelessness has been identified with a number of problematic outcomes as well as a pathway to chronic adult homelessness (Baker Collins, 2013; Chamberlain & Johnson, 2011). Yet, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a common intervention for homeless youth—transitional housing. In this paper, we describe the outcomes of homeless youth who participated in a youth-only transitional housing program. We analyze administrative data on 174 youth who entered and exited the Daybreak Transitional Housing program (Daybreak TH) between 2011 and 2014. We find that the majority of Daybreak TH participants were employed at least 20 h a week at program exit. Youth exited Daybreak TH with higher wages on average, while nearly half achieved educational gains from program entry to exit. Youth who resided in Daybreak TH for 12 months or longer were more likely to achieve positive program outcomes than youth who entered and exited the program in fewer than 12 months. Finally, youth who used drugs and alcohol were less likely than their peers to achieve desired program outcomes, as were those who suffered from chronic illnesses or attention deficit, conduct, or disruptive behavior disorders. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and areas for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child. Youth Serv.

End to end influence maximization for HIV prevention,"Wilder, B.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Hudson, J.; Luna, J.; Wilson, N.; Petering, R.; Woo, D.; Tambe, M.; Rice, E.","This work aims to overcome the challenges in deploying influence maximization to support community driven interventions. Influence maximization is a crucial technique used in preventative health interventions, such as HIV prevention amongst homeless youth. Drop-in centers for homeless youth train a subset of youth as peer leaders who will disseminate information about HIV through their social networks. The challenge is to find a small set of peer leaders who will have the greatest possible influence. While many algorithms have been proposed for influence maximization, none can be feasibly deployed by a service provider: existing algorithms require costly surveys of the entire social network of the youth to provide input data, and high performance computing resources to run the algorithm itself. Both requirements are crucial bottlenecks to widespread use of influence maximization in real world interventions. To address the above challenges, this paper introduces the CHANGE agent for influence maximization. CHANGE handles the end-to-end process of influence maximization, from data collection to peer leader selection. Crucially, CHANGE only surveys a fraction of the youth to gather network data and minimizes computational cost while providing comparable performance to previously proposed algorithms. We carried out a pilot study of CHANGE in collaboration with a drop-in center serving homeless youth in a major U.S. city. CHANGE surveyed only 18% of the youth to construct its social network. However, the peer leaders it selected reached just as many youth as previously field-tested algorithms which surveyed the entire network. This is the first real-world study of a network sampling algorithm for influence maximization. © CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.",2018,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2142,,181-192,,,,#2697,Wilder 2018,,
Growing male prostitution in Russia as a social problem,"Smirnov, A.M.","The article actualizes the problem of male prostitution in Russia. The characteristics of males who provide sexual services on a commercial basis are given. It is shown that the provision of these services discredits the gender characteristics of a man, his appearance in the «mirrar» of the generally accepted sodai and moral norms of behavior. The system of factors contributing to the spread of this sodai phenomenon in Russian sodety is described: sodo-ideological flowering the level of morality); socio-economic (the formation of a «consumer society», the finandä disadvantage of a large part of the population, espedally among young people and marginalized groups, the emergence of precaria t, the increase in the socioeconomic status of women, the development of the market for erotic and pornographic content); sodo-cuttural (freedom of sexual behavior, deformation of gender identity of men, tolerance to the practice of same-sex sexual contacts); social-psychological önfantilization of males, the desire to earn «easy money», the absence or reduction of possible ways of self-assertion of the individual in sodety, the spread of the phenomenon of sodai loneliness, the psychological «libération» of a modem Russian woman); sodal-pedagogical (educational) (crisis of the family institution, homelessness, lack of a system of sexual education and education of minors and youth); socio-medi cal (early sexual life of males, free access to contraceptives). In spite of the fact that there are currently quite a large number of supporters for the introduction of commerdal sexual services on a commercial basis, induding male ones, the author is convinced that the phenomenon deserves a negative sodai and ethical evaluation. Prostitution is a «breeding ground» for the antisocial way of life, leading to various kinds of offenses, induding crime (in particular, «drug crime»). In connection with this, it is required to conduct sdentific research on the sodai nature of male prostituting behavior in Russia and to develop effective measures for its prevention. © Ruslania 2018.

‘To make something with nothing’: Le corbusier’s proposal for refugee housing—les constructions ‘murondins’,"McLeod, M.","This paper discusses the complex political trajectory of Le Corbusier’s little-known project for war refugees, Les Constructions ‘Murondins’, and examines how it embodies a significant transformation in both his social orientation and formal ideas during the 1930s and the Vichy period. In 1940, Le Corbusier and his partner Pierre Jeanneret designed the ‘Murondins’ scheme as a means to erect provisional housing and villages rapidly (including a school, club and youth centre). Le Corbusier proposed that these structures would be built by local youths using pisé (‘rammed earth’), tree trunks, branches and other readily available materials. Beyond housing those in need, he hoped that these new settlements would be the foundation of a new grassroots regional culture that would revitalise the French countryside. For the following two years, he actively promoted the ‘Murondins’ project to the Vichy government (unsuccessfully) as a means of mobilising rural youth; after France’s liberation, he campaigned for it again as a solution for housing war victims. Nor did he abandon it in subsequent decades: in 1955, he proposed it to Abbé Pierre’s Faim et Soif as a solution for sheltering the homeless; and in 1963, he offered it as a means of housing Algerian Muslims fleeing to France after the Algerian war. © 2018 RIBA Enterprises.",2018,,J.

Reaching high-need youth populations with evidence-based sexual health education in California,"Campa, M.I.; Leff, S.Z.; Tufts, M.","Objectives. To explore the programmatic reach and experience of high-need adolescents who received sexual health education in 3 distinct implementation settings (targeted-prevention settings, traditional schools, and alternative schools) through a statewide sexual health education program. Methods. Data are from youth surveys collected between September 2013 and December 2014 in the California Personal Responsibility Education Program. A sample of high-need participants (n = 747) provided data to examine the impact of implementation setting on reach and program experience. Results. Implementation in targeted-prevention settings was equal to or more effective at providing a positive program experience for high-need participants. More than 5 times as many high-need participants were served in targeted-prevention settings compared with traditional schools. Reaching the same number of high-need participants served in targeted-prevention settings over 15 months would take nearly 7 years of programming in traditional schools. Conclusions. To maximize the reach and experience of high-need youth populations receiving sexual health education, state and local agencies should consider the importance of implementation setting. Targeted resources and efforts should be directed toward high-need young people by expanding beyond traditional school settings.",2018,,Am. J.

Closer to Guns: the Role of Street Gangs in Facilitating Access to Illegal Firearms,"Roberto, E.; Braga, A.A.; Papachristos, A.V.","Criminal offenders often turn to social networks to gain access to firearms, yet we know little about how networks facilitate access to firearms. This study conducts a network analysis of a co-offending network for the City of Chicago to determine how close any offender may be to a firearm. We use arrest data to recreate the co-offending network of all individuals who were arrested with at least one other person over an eight-year period. We then use data on guns recovered by the police to measure potential network pathways of any individual to known firearms. We test the hypothesis that gangs facilitate access to firearms and the extent to which such access relates to gunshot injury among gang members. Findings reveal that gang membership reduces the potential network distance (how close someone is) to known firearms by 20% or more, and regression results indicate that the closer gang members are to guns, the greater their risk of gunshot victimization. © 2018, The New York Academy of Medicine.",2018,,Urban Health,95,3,372-382,,10.1007/s11524-018-0259-1,,#2704,Roberto 2018,,
The relationship between self-reported executive functioning and risk-taking behavior in urban homeless youth,"Piche, J.; Kaylegian, J.; Smith, D.; Hunter, S.J.","Introduction: Almost 2 million U.S. youth are estimated to live on the streets, in shelters, or in other types of temporary housing at some point each year. Both their age and living situations make them more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, particularly during adolescence, a time of increased risk taking. Much of self-control appears related to the development of the prefrontal cortex, which is at a particularly crucial period of elaboration and refinement during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Executive processes like decision-making, inhibition, planning, and reasoning may be vulnerable to adversity experienced as a result of homelessness and related impoverishment during childhood and adolescence. No study to date, to our knowledge, has directly investigated differences in risk-taking by homeless youth as it relates to their developing executive control. Objective: Examine the relationship between the level of self-reported executive function (EF) and engagement in risk taking behaviors among a sample of shelter-living urban homeless youth. We predicted that homeless youth who have lower levels of self-reported EF would more readily engage in risky behaviors that could lead to negative outcomes. Participants: One hundred and forty-nine youths between 18 and 22 years of age were recruited from homeless agencies in Chicago. Of this study sample, 53% were female and 76% African American. Measures: All participants completed, as part of a broader neuropsychological assessment, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning-Adult Version (BRIEF-A), the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Analyses: Groups were separated based on level of self-reported EF, with two groups identified: High self-reported EF fell >1 SD above the normative average, and low self-reported EF fell >1 SD below the normative average. All analyses utilized Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Results and Conclusions: Analyses revealed a relationship between the level of self-reported EF and risk taking behaviors in this group of sheltered homeless urban youths. Those with lower self-reported executive functioning had higher rates of engagement in multiple substance-related risk taking behaviors. These findings are important because they are a first step towards identifying contributions to risk-taking behavior in urban homeless youths. Identifying potential factors like low self-reported EF better allows us to potentially intervene, thereby providing focused support to youths who are at higher risk for engaging in problematic behaviors. © 2018 by the Authors.",2018,,Behavioral Sciences,8,1,,,10.3390/bs8010006,,#2705,Piche 2018,,
"Designing fair, efficient, and interpretable policies for prioritizing homeless youth for housing resources","Azizi, M.J.; Vayanos, P.; Wilder, B.; Rice, E.; Tambe, M.","We consider the problem of designing fair, efficient, and interpretable policies for prioritizing heterogeneous homeless youth on a waiting list for scarce housing resources of different types. We focus on point-based policies that use features of the housing resources (e.g., permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing) and the youth (e.g., age, history of substance use) to maximize the probability that the youth will have a safe and stable exit from the housing program. The policies can be used to prioritize waitlisted youth each time a housing resource is procured. Our framework provides the policy-maker the flexibility to select both their desired structure for the policy and their desired fairness requirements. Our approach can thus explicitly trade-off interpretability and efficiency while ensuring that fairness constraints are met. We propose a flexible data-driven mixed-integer optimization formulation for designing the policy, along with an approximate formulation which can be solved efficiently for broad classes of interpretable policies using Bender’s decomposition. We evaluate our framework using real-world data from the United States homeless youth housing system. We show that our framework results in policies that are more fair than the current policy in place and than classical interpretable machine learning approaches while achieving a similar (or higher) level of overall efficiency. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10848 LNCS,,35-51,,10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_3,,#2706,Azizi 2018,,
Care Like Kin: Community Based Youth Serving Organizations and the Social Reproduction of Disconnected Youth in Rural America,"Visser, M.A.","Increasing economic insecurity faced by older youth in rural America presents a crisis of social reproduction for disconnected youth in these areas. Increasingly community based youth serving organizations (CBYSOs) are recognizing and responding to the social reproduction needs of this particularly vulnerable youth population. Such responses are often hidden from funders, government agencies, and community residents. Yet these institutions play an important substitution function for disconnected youth and provide critical social support and social leverage for this population. Based on case studies of three CBYSOs in the San Joaquin Valley of California, this article explores how and why CBYSOs play a substitution function for disconnected youth in rural communities. It is the argument of this article that the social reproduction work of CBYSOs is undertaken with a ethic of care that may have the capacity to transform the political, social, and economic contexts that face this marginalized youth population. © Society for Community Research and Action 2018",2018,,Am.

The average number of texts answered per day was 8.49 (of a possible 11). Forty-three percent of days had answers to all 11 texts sent that day, and 69.4% of days had answers to eight or more texts. We found significant differences in response rates by phone type. Seventy-three percent of youth reported that responding to our texts was very easy or somewhat easy and 69% endorsed the response option “just enough,” regarding the number of texts sent per day. The 30-day texting period was deemed “about right” by 74% of youth.

Envisioning Democracy: Participatory Filmmaking with Homeless Youth,"Kennelly, J.","This paper explores the democratic potential for participatory filmmaking with homeless youth, as well as the constraints and dilemmas associated with this visual method. Theorizing democracy through the work of Hannah Arendt and Pierre Bourdieu, the paper approaches democracy not as an end, but rather as a process that seeks to lessen social injustice. Bourdieu's work helps us appreciate, however, that this process is constrained by structures of inequality that shape access to the political dispositions that enable such engagement. Consistent with other research on low-income and marginalized young people, this study found that homeless youth engage with democracy through forms of community participation and mutual support, and are disinclined to orient toward liberal democratic structures such as voting and political parties, which they see as harmful or problematic. With a focus on one particular dilemma faced by the research team—namely, the question of how to make sense of and represent the issue of legalizing marijuana, which had been signaled by the youth participants as of primary political importance to them—the paper uses Arendt and Bourdieu to discuss how participatory filmmaking can help to expand the space of appearances available to homeless youth in Canadian society, and create a space at a shared table of understanding with middle class power brokers. © 2018 Canadian Sociological Association/La Société canadienne de sociologie",2018,,Can.

The elusive goal of social integration: A critical examination of the socio-economic and psychosocial consequences experienced by homeless young people who obtain housing,"Thulien, N.S.; Gastaldo, D.; Hwang, S.W.; McCay, E.","Objectives: The objective of this study was to provide an insider perspective on the experiences of nine formerly homeless young people as they transitioned into independent (market rent) housing and attempted to achieve meaningful social integration. Methods: The study was conducted in Toronto, Canada, and guided by the conceptual framework developed for the World Health Organization by the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. A critical ethnographic methodology was used. Over the course of 10 months, the lead author met every other week with nine formerly homeless young people who had moved into their own homes within 30 days prior to study recruitment. Results: Unaffordable housing, limited education, inadequate employment opportunities, poverty-level income, and limited social capital made it remarkably challenging for the young people to move forward. As the study progressed, the participants’ ability to formulate long-range plans was impeded as they were forced to focus on day-to-day existence. Over time, living in a perpetual state of poverty led to feelings of “outsiderness,” viewing life as a game of chance, and isolation. Conclusion: Rather than a secure, linear path from the streets to the mainstream, study participants were forced to take a precarious path full of structural gaps that left them stuck, spinning, and exhausted by the day-to-day struggle to meet basic needs. Despite their remarkable agency, it was almost impossible for the participants to achieve meaningful social integration given the structural inequities inherent in society.

Youth Homelessness: The Impact of Supportive Relationships on Recovery,"Gasior, S.; Forchuk, C.; Regan, S.","Background: Homeless youth are the fastest growing sub-group within the homeless population. They face impaired access to health services and are often left unsupported. They lack social and family support or relationships with service providers. Unsupported homeless youth often become homeless adults. Purpose: To test a model based on Peplau’s Theory of Interpersonal Relations, examining the influence of a network of service providers, perceptions of social supports, and family relations on a homeless youth’s perceptions of recovery. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis and used a sample (n = 187) of data collected as part of the original Youth Matters in London study. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze the relationship between variables. Participants were interviewed at 6-month intervals over a 2.5-year period. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used. Results: Network of service providers, perceived social supports, and perceived family relations explained 21.8% of the variance in homeless youth perceptions of recovery. Perceived social support and family relations were significantly, positively correlated to perceptions of recovery. Network of service providers was not significantly correlated to perceptions of recovery.

Do Programs for Runaway and Homeless Youth Work? A Qualitative Exploration From the Perspectives of Youth Clients in Diverse Settings,"Gwadz, M.; Freeman, R.M.; Kutnick, A.H.; Silverman, E.; Ritchie, A.S.; Cleland, C.M.; Leonard, N.R.; Srinagesh, A.; Powlovich, J.; Bolas, J.","Runaway and homeless youth (RHY) comprise a large population of young people who reside outside the control and protection of parents and guardians and who experience numerous traumas and risk factors, but few buffering resources. Specialized settings have developed to serve RHY, but little is known about their effects. The present cross-sectional qualitative descriptive study, grounded in the positive youth development approach and the Youth Program Quality Assessment model, addressed this gap in the literature. From a larger sample of 29 RHY-specific settings across New York State, RHY ages 16–21 from 11 settings were purposively sampled for semi-structured in-depth interviews on their transitions into homelessness, experiences with settings, and unmet needs (N = 37 RHY). Data were analyzed with a theory-driven and inductive systematic content analysis approach. Half of participants (54%) were female; almost half (49%) identified as non-heterosexual; and 42% were African American/Black, 31% were Latino/Hispanic, and 28% were White/other. Results indicated that because RHY are a uniquely challenged population, distrustful of service settings and professional adults and skilled at surviving independently, the population-tailored approaches found in RHY-specific settings are vital to settings’ abilities to effectively engage and serve RHY. We found the following four major themes regarding the positive effects of settings: (1) engaging with an RHY setting was emotionally challenging and frightening, and thus the experiences of safety and services tailored to RHY needs were critical; (2) instrumental support from staff was vital and most effective when received in a context of emotional support; (3) RHY were skilled at survival on the streets, but benefited from socialization into more traditional systems to foster future independent living; and (4) follow-through and aftercare were needed as RHY transitioned out of services. With respect to gaps in settings, RHY highlighted the following: (1) a desire for better management of tension between youths’ needs for structure and wishes for autonomy and (2) lack of RHY input into program governance. This study advances our understanding of RHY, their service needs, and the ways settings meet these needs, as well as remaining gaps. It underscores the vital, life-changing, and even life-saving role these settings play for RHY. © Copyright © 2018 Gwadz, Freeman, Kutnick, Silverman, Ritchie, Cleland, Leonard, Srinagesh, Powlovich and Bolas.",2018,,Front.

In addition to difficulties accessing trans-affirming supports and services, transgender and gender expansive YYA must contend with structural constraints and oppressive messages about who they are and who they can become. Despite these challenges, transgender and gender expansive YYA experiencing homelessness are finding innovative ways to resist the multiple and overlapping institutionalized challenges they face. Methods: This qualitative study examined the ways a group of transgender and gender expansive YYA demonstrate resilience and resist dominant narratives about what it means to be young, transgender and experiencing homelessness. Results: Two primary themes were identified through which transgender and gender expansive YYA experiencing homelessness demonstrated resilience in the midst of structural constraints and oppressive narratives about who they are and who they can become: personal agency and future orientation. Participants exercised personal agency through self-definition and making their own choices. They oriented themselves to future possibilities through positive meaning-making and re-visioning the meaning of home. Participants engaged in these acts of resilience and resistance despite receiving negative messages about themselves. Conclusions: Study findings illustrate the capacity of transgender and gender expansive YYA experiencing homelessness to reframe their challenges as positive experiences, integral to the people they have become or will be in the future.

The impact of transitional programmes on post-transition outcomes for youth leaving out-of-home care: a meta-analysis,"Heerde, J.A.; Hemphill, S.A.; Scholes-Balog, K.E.","Youth residing in out-of-home care settings have often been exposed to childhood trauma, and commonly report experiencing adverse outcomes after transitioning from care. This meta-analysis appraised internationally published literature investigating the impact of transitional programme participation (among youth with a baseline age of 15–24 years) on post-transition outcomes of housing, education, employment, mental health and substance use. A comprehensive search of sociology (e.g. ProQuest Sociology), psychology (e.g. PsycInfo) and health (e.g. ProQuest Family Health) electronic abstraction databases was conducted for the period 1990–2014. Search terms included ‘out-of-home care’, ‘transition’, ‘housing’, ‘education’, ‘employment’, ‘mental health’ and ‘substance use’. Nineteen studies, all from the United States, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Living independently and homelessness were the most commonly described housing outcomes. Rates of post-transition employment varied, while rates of post-secondary education were low. Depression and alcohol use were commonly reported among transitioning youth. Findings of the meta-analysis showed that attention should be given to the potential benefit of transitional programme participation on outcomes such as housing, employment and education. Moderator analyses showed that these benefits may differ based on study design, sample size and sampling unit, but not for mean age or gender.

Predicting running away in girls who are victims of commercial sexual exploitation,"Hershberger, A.R.; Sanders, J.; Chick, C.; Jessup, M.; Hanlin, H.; Cyders, M.A.","Youth that are victims of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) have a host of clinical problems and often run away from home, residential care, and treatment, which complicates and limits treatment effectiveness. No research to date has attempted to predict running away in CSEC victims. The present study aimed to 1) characterize a clinically referred sample of girls who were victims of CSEC and compare them to other high-risk girls (i.e., girls who also have a history of trauma and running away, but deny CSEC); and 2) examine the utility of using the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) to predict future running away. Data were collected from de-identified charts of 80 girls (mean age = 15.38, SD = 1.3, 37.9% White, 52.5% CSEC victims) who were referred for psychological assessment by the Department of Child Services. Girls in the CSEC group were more likely to have experienced sexual abuse (χ                             2                              = 6.85, p =.009), an STI (χ                             2                              = 6.45, p =.01), a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis (χ                             2                              = 11.84, p =.001), and a substance use disorder diagnosis (χ                             2                              = 11.32, p =.001) than high-risk girls. Moderated regression results indicated that YLS/CMI scores significantly predicted future running away among the CSEC group (β = 0.23, SE =.06, p =.02), but not the high-risk group (β = −.008, SE =.11, p =.90). The YLS/CMI shows initial promise for predicting future running away in girls who are CSEC victims. Predicting running away can help identify those at risk for and prevent running away and improve treatment outcomes.

Virtuous profits: Pay for success arrangements and the future of recidivism reduction,"Myers, R.R.; Goddard, T.","Pay for success contracting is the latest financial instrument for funding social programs. Governments in Australia, the UK, the US, and elsewhere are piloting their use in reentry programs, youth offender programs, and a host of other initiatives aimed at homelessness, child welfare, workforce development, and preventive health care. Under a pay for success arrangement, private investors put up capital to fund a program, and if successful, a government agency will repay the investors with a yield, that is, with a profit. This article situates pay for success contracting in the context of reentry and decarceration and it theorizes how the arrangement will reverberate through new alternatives to incarceration and fundamentally change the meaning of “what works.” The article concludes by locating pay for success within the broader drift toward securitizing marginal populations under neoliberalism. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",2018,,Punishment Soc.,20,2,155-173,,10.1177/1462474516680209,,#2728,Myers 2018,,

"How Marginalized Young People Access, Engage With, and Navigate Health-Care Systems in the Digital Age: Systematic Review","Robards, F.; Kang, M.; Usherwood, T.; Sanci, L.","Purpose: This systematic review examines how marginalized young people access and engage with health services and navigate health-care systems in high-income countries. Methods: Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo, The University of Sydney Library database, and Google Scholar were searched to identify qualitative and quantitative original research, published from 2006 to 2017, that focused on selected definitions of marginalized young people (12 to 24 years), their parents/carers, and/or health professionals working with these populations. A thematic synthesis was undertaken identifying themes across and between groups on barriers and/or facilitators to access, engagement, and/or navigation of health-care systems. Results: Of 1,796 articles identified, 68 studies in the final selection focused on marginalized young people who were homeless (n = 20), living in rural areas (n = 14), of refugee background (n = 11), gender and/or sexuality diverse (n = 11), indigenous (n = 4), low income (n = 4), young offenders (n = 2), or living with a disability (n = 2). Studies were from the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Portugal, including 44 qualitative, 16 quantitative, and 8 mixed-method study types. Sample sizes ranged from 3 to 1,388. Eight themes were identified relating to ability to recognize and understand health issues; service knowledge and attitudes toward help seeking; structural barriers; professionals’ knowledge, skills, attitudes; service environments and structures; ability to navigate the health system; youth participation; and technology opportunities. Conclusions: Marginalized young people experience barriers in addition to those common to all young people. Future studies should consider the role of technology in access, engagement, and health system navigation, and the impact of intersectionality between marginalized groups. © 2017 The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2018,,J.

Predictors of Retention in an Alcohol and Risky Sex Prevention Program for Homeless Young Adults,"Pedersen, E.R.; Ewing, B.A.; D’Amico, E.J.; Miles, J.N.V.; Haas, A.C.; Tucker, J.S.","Homeless young adults are at risk for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and risky sexual behavior. Interventions are needed to help these young people reduce their risky behavior, but this population is often difficult to engage and retain in services. We offered a four-session AOD and risky sex reduction program to 100 participants and examined if retention in the program was predicted by a number of factors: demographics, homelessness severity, other service use, AOD behaviors, mental health symptoms, sexual risk behaviors, and readiness to change AOD and condom use. Nearly half (48%) of participants completed all sessions. In bivariate analyses, participants were significantly less likely to be retained in the program if they had slept outdoors in the past month, engaged in more alcohol and marijuana use, experienced more alcohol-related consequences, and received the program in an urban drop-in center (as opposed to a drop-in center near the beach). When controlling for all significant bivariate relationships, only sleeping outdoors and receipt of the program in the urban setting predicted fewer sessions completed. The most endorsed reasons for program non-completion were being too busy to attend and inconvenient day/time of the program. Findings can help outreach staff and researchers better prepare methods to engage higher risk homeless youth and retain them in services. Finding unique ways to help youth overcome barriers related to location of services appears especially necessary, perhaps by bringing services to youth where they temporarily reside or offering meaningful incentives for program attendance. © 2018, Society for Prevention Research.",2018,,Prev.

Cannabis use is associated with lower rates of initiation of injection drug use among street-involved youth: A longitudinal analysis,"Reddon, H.; DeBeck, K.; Socias, M.E.; Dong, H.; Wood, E.; Montaner, J.; Kerr, T.; Milloy, M.-J.","Introduction and Aims: Street-involved youth are known to be at elevated risk of initiating injection drug use. However, the impact of so-called ‘gateway’ drugs, such as cannabis, on injection initiation is unknown. The objective of this study was to examine the association between cannabis use and initiation of injection drug use among a prospective cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Design and Methods: Data for this study were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study. From September 2005 to May 2015, participants aged 14–26 who reported illicit drug use were recruited into this open prospective cohort study. An extended Cox regression model with time-updated covariates was used to identify factors independently associated with injection initiation. Results: During the study period, 481 street-involved youth were included in this study. Of these, 228 (47.4%) reported at least daily cannabis use, and 103 (21.4%) initiated injection drug use. In a multivariable analysis, ≥daily cannabis use was associated with slower rates of injection initiation (adjusted relative hazard 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.98; P = 0.038). Sub-analyses revealed that cannabis use was negatively associated with initiation of injection stimulants but not initiation of injection opioids. Discussion and Conclusions: Given the expansion of cannabis legalisation throughout North America, it is encouraging that cannabis use was associated with slower time to initiation of injection drug use in this cohort. This finding challenges the view of cannabis as a gateway substance that precipitates the progression to using harder and more addictive drugs. © 2018 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs",2018,,Drug Alcohol Rev.,37,3,421-428,,10.1111/dar.12667,,#2739,Reddon 2018,,
"Suicidal ideation among youth living in the slums of Kampala, Uganda","Culbreth, R.; Swahn, M.H.; Ndetei, D.; Ametewee, L.; Kasirye, R.","The purpose of this study is to examine the factors associated with suicidal ideation among youth living in the slums of Kampala, Uganda. Analyses are based on cross-sectional survey data, collected in 2014, of a convenience sample (n = 1134) of urban service-seeking youth participating in a Uganda Youth Development Link drop-in center. Logistic regression analyses were computed to determine the psychosocial factors associated with suicidal ideation. Among youth participants, 23.54% (n = 266) reported suicidal ideation in the past year. In the multivariable analysis, suicidal ideation was associated with being female (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.25), reporting one (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.18) or two deceased parents (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.35), ever living on the streets (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.86, 3.79), problem drinking (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.80), sexually transmitted infection (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.21), ever being raped (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.20), and experiencing physical child abuse (OR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.75, 3.27). Our findings underscore many unmet needs in this vulnerable population. However, strategies that specifically seek to address problem drinking—a modifiable risk factor for suicidal ideation—may be particularly warranted in this low-resource setting. © 2018 by the authors.

"Conditional Families and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Youth Homelessness: Gender, Sexuality, Family Instability, and Rejection","Robinson, B.A.","Existing research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth homelessness identifies family rejection as a main pathway into homelessness for the youth. This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the conditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality. This rejection generated strained familial ties within families wherein the ties were already fragile. Likewise, the author shows how being gender expansive marked many youth's experiences of familial abuse and strain. This study proposes the concept of conditional families to capture the social processes of how poverty and family instability shape experiences of gender, sexuality, and rejection for some LGBTQ youth. © 2018 National Council on Family Relations",2018,,J.

"Psychosocial differences between Mexican girls at risk of homelessness and those unsheltered, sheltered or emergency sheltered","Castaños-Cervantes, S.; Turnbull, B.; Aguilar-Villalobos, J.","Homeless girls are one of the world’s most vulnerable sociocultural groups. Homeless girls experience forced labor victimization, sexual exploitation, abuse, discrimination and marginalization at higher rates than the general population. As a result, they often present internalized and externalized psychological disorders and lack functional problem solving, coping and emotion regulation skills, which can negatively affect mental health and well-being. Despite these serious disparities, few research studies have addressed homeless girls’ mental health and well-being. Virtually no known research addressing the psychosocial differences between sub-groups of Mexican homeless girls, including girls that are at risk of homelessness and unhoused girls or girls housed in emergency shelters, exists to date. The aim of this study was to examine differences of psychosocial characteristics in homeless girls by subgroup. Working with nongovernmental organizations that serve homeless youth, a convenience sample of 90 Mexican girls between the ages of 11 and 18, including 45 emergency sheltered or unsheltered girls and a comparison group of 45 girls at risk of homelessness, were individually interviewed using psychometric instruments developed by the authors. Findings revealed that emergency sheltered or unsheltered homeless girls experience higher levels of depression, higher levels of dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies, lower indexes of subjective well-being, and experience negative emotions more intensely and frequently than the comparison at risk for homelessness group. This study is limited in its generalizability due to its purposive sampling method. Study implications highlight the need for specific interventions by sub-group to promote the mental health and well-being of homeless girls and girls at risk for homelessness. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,Vulnerable Child.

Men's experiences of early life trauma and pathways into long-term homelessness,"Woodhall-Melnik, J.; Dunn, J.R.; Svenson, S.; Patterson, C.; Matheson, F.I.","Previous studies that have explored the association between childhood trauma and homelessness indicate that traumatic events can lead to survivor distrust of interpersonal relationships and institutions, prolonged homelessness and poor health and social outcomes. The majority of this literature relies on quantitative data and fails to investigate the personal experiences of childhood trauma that are found to impact housing status later in life. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 men living in an urban area in Ontario who had spent more than 30 consecutive nights in an emergency shelter over the course of their housing histories. During data analysis, it was observed that all of the men had experienced some form of trauma or neglect in childhood which contributed to their entries into homelessness. Using a case study approach, three entry pathways into long term homelessness are described: 1) youth; 2) emerging or early adulthood; and 3) middle adulthood. Participants are classified into the pathways by the developmental period at which they first entered homelessness. These findings have implications for policy makers and service providers, as key intervention points are identified. Establishing effective interventions that address crises experienced at these points could assist with homelessness prevention across the life course. © 2018",2018,,Child Abuse Negl.,80,,216-225,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.03.027,,#2748,Woodhall-Melnik 2018,,
End-to-end influence maximization in the field,"Wilder, B.; Onasch-Vera, L.; Hudson, J.; Luna, J.; Wilson, N.; Petering, R.; Woo, D.; Tambe, M.; Rice, E.","This work is aims to overcome the challenges in deploying influence maximization to support community driven interventions. Influence maximization is a crucial technique used in preventative health interventions, such as HIV prevention amongst homeless youth. Drop-in centers for homeless youth train a subset of youth as peer leaders who will disseminate information about HIV through their social networks. The challenge is to find a small set of peer leaders who will have the greatest possible influence. While many algorithms have been proposed for influence maximization, none can be feasibly deployed by a service provider: Existing algorithms require costly surveys of the entire social network of the youth to provide input data, and high performance computing resources to run the algorithm itself. Both are crucial bottlenecks to widespread use of influence maximization in real world interventions. To address the above challenges, this paper introduces the CHANGE agent for influence maximization. CHANGE handles the end-to- end process of influence maximization, from data collection to peer leader selection. Crucially, CHANGE only surveys a fraction of the youth to gather network data and minimizes computational cost while providing comparable performance to previously proposed algorithms. We carried out a pilot study of CHANGE in collaboration with a drop-in center serving homeless youth in a major U.S. city. CHANGE surveyed only 18% of the youth to construct its social network. However, the peer leaders it selected reached just as many youth as previously field-tested algorithms which surveyed the entire network. This is the first real-world study of a network sampling algorithm for influence maximization. Simulation results on real-world networks also support our claims. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

"'Hello, you're not supposed to be here': Homeless emerging adults' experiences negotiating food access","Bowen, E.A.; Irish, A.","Objective We aimed to examine the food-seeking experiences of homeless emerging adults (age 18-24 years) in a US urban context. Design The study used a qualitative descriptive design, combining semi-structured interviews with a standardized quantitative measure of food insecurity. Interview data were coded using constant comparative methods to identify patterns across and within interviews. Emerging themes were confirmed and refined through member checking. Setting Buffalo, a mid-sized city in the Northeastern USA. Subjects A sample of thirty participants was recruited through community-based methods. Eligibility criteria specified that participants were aged 18-24 years and did not have a stable place to live. The sample was demographically diverse and included participants who were couch-surfing, staying on the streets and/or using shelters. Results Participants' food access strategies varied across their living circumstances. Common strategies included purchasing food with cash or benefits (reported by 77 %), using free meal programmes (70 %) and eating at friends' or relatives' homes (47 %). Although 70 % of participants received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, several reported access barriers, including initial denials of eligibility due to being listed on a parent's application even when the participant no longer resided in the household. Participants described a stigma associated with using food pantries and free meal programmes and expressed preference for less institutionalized programmes such as Food Not Bombs. Conclusions Given endemic levels of food insecurity among homeless youth and young adults, policy modifications and service interventions are needed to improve food access for this population. © 2018 The Authors.",2018,,Public Health Nutr.,21,10,1943-1951,,10.1017/S1368980018000356,,#2754,Bowen 2018,,
"Activating the ""breakfast club"": Modeling influence spread in natural-world social networks","Hu, L.; Wilder, B.; Yadav, A.; Rice, E.; Tambe, M.","While reigning models of diffusion have privileged the structure of a given social network as the key to informational exchange, real human interactions do not appear to take place on a single graph of connections. Using data collected from a pilot study of the spread of HIV awareness in social networks of homeless youth, we show that health information did not diffuse in the field according to the processes outlined by dominant models. Since physical network diffusion scenarios often diverge from their more well-studied counterparts on digital networks, we propose an alternative Activation Jump Model (AJM) that describes information diffusion on physical networks from a multi-agent team perspective. Our model exhibits two main differentiating features from leading cascade and threshold models of influence spread: 1) The structural composition of a seed set team impacts each individual node's influencing behavior, and 2) an influencing node may spread information to non-neighbors. We show that the AJM significantly outperforms existing models in its fit to the observed node-level influence data on the youth networks. We then prove theoretical results, showing that the AJM exhibits many well-behaved properties shared by dominant models. Our results suggest that the AJM presents a flexible and more accurate model of network diffusion that may better inform influence maximization in the field. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Socioeconomic deprivation and the development of neuropsychological functions: A study with “street children” in Ecuador,"Pluck, G.; Banda-Cruz, D.R.; Andrade-Guimaraes, M.V.; Trueba, A.F.","Socioeconomic status (SES) is known to have a considerable influence on the development of neuropsychological functions. In particular there is strong evidence for less efficient development of prefrontal-cortex-related functions in children raised in low-SES households. “Street children” are a common feature of low SES in many low- and middle-income countries, and some researchers have suggested that the unique life experiences of street children may drive their neurocognitive development. This study compares a group of 36 former street children in Quito, Ecuador with a control group of 26 never street-connected schoolchildren. All children were assessed with a range of neuropsychological tests. Although the street children group performed significantly below the level of the control group on all measures, they did not demonstrate a generalized lower ability. By controlling the effects of fluid intelligence it was found that there are relatively independent effects on visuospatial ability and executive planning ability. Furthermore, the executive function test scores in general are significantly less affected than the other cognitive functions and may be temporary effects caused by recent substance abuse within the street child sample. The findings generally support results from other countries suggesting that low SES is associated with negative effects on neuropsychological development. However, they also suggest that the local social and economic context, such as in the case of street children, might mitigate the harmful effects of low SES on the development of some executive functions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,Child Neuropsychol.,24,4,510-523,,10.1080/09297049.2017.1294150,,#2760,Pluck 2018,,
Maximizing influence in an unknown social network,"Wilder, B.; Immorlica, N.; Rice, E.; Tambe, M.","In many real world applications of influence maximization, practitioners intervene in a population whose social structure is initially unknown. This poses a multiagent systems challenge to act under uncertainty about how the agents are connected. We formalize this problem by introducing exploratory influence maximization, in which an algorithm queries individual network nodes (agents) to learn their links. The goal is to locate a seed set nearly as influential as the global optimum using very few queries. We show that this problem is intractable for general graphs. However, real world networks typically have community structure, where nodes are arranged in densely connected subgroups. We present the ARISEN algorithm, which leverages community structure to find an influential seed set. Experiments on real world networks of homeless youth, village populations in India, and others demonstrate ARISEN's strong empirical performance. To formally demonstrate how ARISEN exploits community structure, we prove an approximation guarantee for ARISEN on graphs drawn from the Stochastic Block Model.

"The Complexity of Family Reactions to Identity among Homeless and College Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Young Adults","Schmitz, R.M.; Tyler, K.A.","Familial responses to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people’s identities range on a spectrum from rejection to acceptance and these reactions strongly impact family relationships and young adult well-being. Less is known, however, about how family members’ reactions may differ based on young people’s contexts of socioeconomic status. Through a qualitative, life course analysis of in-depth interview data from 46 LGBTQ college students and LGBTQ homeless young adults, our study highlights the diverse, contextual nuances of young people’s “linked lives” within their families. We find that the context of socioeconomic status influenced how a young person managed family rejection. Conversely, processes of familial acceptance were also connected to life course transitions that worked in some cases to enhance LGBTQ young adults’ family relationships. Finally, the intricacy of familial reactions to a young person’s LGBTQ identity transcended socioeconomic contexts as many respondents shared similar experiences of rejection and acceptance. These findings have implications for understanding how young people manage family relationships across different contexts of socioeconomic status and how these experiences can shape their life course trajectories. Results from this study can inform LGBTQ youth service providers by tailoring intervention programs that account for contextual social diversity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2018,,Arch.

"Causes of death among street-connected children and youth in Eldoret, Kenya","Embleton, L.; Ayuku, D.; Makori, D.; Kamanda, A.; Braitstein, P.","Background: Street-connected young people carry a disproportionate burden of morbidities, and engage in a variety of practices that may heighten their risk of premature mortality, yet there are currently no reports in the literature on the rates or risk factors for mortality among them, nor on their causes of death. In low- and middle-income countries they are frequently in situations that violate their human rights, likely contributing to their increased burden of morbidities and vulnerability to mortality. We thus sought to describe the number of deaths annually, causes of death, and determine the number of deaths attributable to HIV among street-connected young people aged 0 to 30 years in Eldoret, Kenya. Methods: Eldoret, Kenya has approximately 1900 street-connected young people. We collected data on deaths occurring from October 2009 to December 2016 from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital records, Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare HIV program records, and utilized verbal autopsies when no records were available. Descriptive analyses were conducted stratified by sex and age category, and frequencies and proportions were calculated to provide an overview of the decedents. We used logistic regression to assess the association between underlying cause of death and sex, while controlling for age and location of death. Results: In total there were 100-recorded deaths, 66 among males and 34 among females; 37% of were among those aged ≤18 years. HIV/AIDS (37%) was the most common underlying cause of death, followed by assault (36%) and accidents (10%) for all decedents. Among males, the majority of deaths were attributable to assault (49%) and HIV/AIDS (26%), while females primarily died due to HIV/AIDS (59%). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a high number of deaths due to assault among males and HIV/AIDS among males and females. Our findings demonstrate the need for studies of HIV prevalence and incidence among this population to characterize the burden of HIV, particularly among young women given the higher number of deaths attributed to HIV/AIDS among them. Most deaths were preventable and require the urgent attention of service providers and policymakers to implement programs and services to prevent premature mortality and uphold children's rights. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,,BMC Int.

Objective: This qualitative study therefore aimed at determining the behavioural risks for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and health seeking behaviour of street youths in Ibadan. Methods: Sixteen focus group discussion (FGD) sessions were conducted among 160 street youths aged between 15-24 years. Result: The result showed that most of the respondents had low perception of risk of contracting STIs in spite of their risky behaviours which included multiple sexual partnering, sharing of personal effects, malnourishment and sexual harassment. Most of the street youth could not identify the various types however; Gonorrhea and HIV were commonly mentioned by them. The major treatment regimen for STIs was traditional remedies and drugs obtained from patent medicine vendors. Traditional remedies were preferred by most of the participants and considered to be more effective. Conclusion: Majority of the street youths were sexually active, engaged in high risk sexual behaviours and had inappropriately treated sexually transmitted infections.

Yet, HIV prevention in this high-risk population has been only marginally effective. Objective: The aim of this study was to use ecological momentary assessments to examine real-time factors to determine the predictors of sexual activity among homeless youth. Methods: Youth experiencing homelessness aged between 18 and 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center in Houston, Texas, between August 2015 and May 2016.

The mean number of EMAs completed by each participant was 45 out of 105 possible observations. During the study, 70% (46/66) of participants were sexually active and reported condomless sex in 102 of the 137 cases of sexual intercourse (74.5%). In total, 82% (38/46) of the youth who reported having sex during the 3 weeks of data collection also reported engaging in high-risk sexual activities, including having condomless sex (24/46, 53%), having multiple sexual partners on the same day (12/46, 26%), trading sex (7/46, 16%), and sharing needles while injecting drugs (1/46, 3%). Of those, 71% (27/38) were engaged in multiple sexual risk behaviors. The predictive model was based on observations from 66 subjects who reported 137 cases of sexual intercourse over 811 days; sexual orientation, race, mental health, drug use, and sexual urge were included as predictors in the parsimonious generalized linear mixed model selected on the basis of the Akaike information criterion. The estimated odds ratios (ORs) were notable for same-day drug use (OR 8.80, 95% CI 4.48-17.31; P<.001) and sexual urge (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.60-11.28; P=.004). The performance of the risk estimator was satisfactory, as indicated by the value of 0.834 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: Real-time EMA data can be used to predict sexual intercourse among a sample of high-risk, predominately unsheltered homeless youth. Sexual urge and drug use accounts for increased odds of engaging in sexual activity on any given day. Interventions targeting sexual urge and drug use may help predict sexual activity among a population at high risk of HIV. © Diane Santa Maria, Nikhil Padhye, Yijiong Yang, Kathryn Gallardo, Michael Businelle.",2018,,JMIR Publ.

Promoting resilience in youth experiencing homelessness through implementation of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act,"Clemens, E.; Hess, R.S.; Strear, M.M.; Rue, L.; Rizzolo, S.; Henninger, J.","This Consensual Qualitative Research study explored experiences of youth, families, and homeless liaisons to better understand how educational environments can foster resilience among youth experiencing homelessness. The purpose of the study was to provide educational stakeholders with guidance on how to actualize the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act into saturated services that promote strength, hope, and high expectations for youth experiencing homelessness. A bioecological framework was used to conceptualize the interplay of systems. Four domains emerged from participants' collective beliefs on the implementation of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act: critical incidents, philosophy of services, community and school collaboration, and relationships with families.

Multiple traumas and resilience among street children in Haiti: Psychopathology of survival,"Cénat, J.M.; Derivois, D.; Hébert, M.; Amédée, L.M.; Karray, A.","In Haiti, as in several developing countries, the phenomenon of street children has become a major public health issue. These children are often victims of traumas and adverse life events. This article aimed to investigate traumas experienced by street children and their coping and resilience strategies used to deal with adversities in a logic of survival, relying on a mixed method approach. A group of 176 street children, aged 7–18 (n = 21 girls), recruited in Port-au-Prince, completed measures assessing PTSD, social support and resilience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to document traumatic experiences, factors related to resilience and coping strategies. After performing statistical analyses to evaluate prevalence and predictors associated with PTSD, and level of social support satisfaction and resilience, qualitative analysis using a grounded theory approach was conducted. Results showed that street children experienced multiple traumas such as neglect, maltreatment, psychological, physical and sexual abuse. However, they also showed self-efficacy to face their traumatic experiences and few of them (less than 15%) obtained scores reaching clinical rates of PTSD, while a large majority presented a level of resilience between moderate to very high. A socio-ecological model of multiple traumas and a model of coping, survival and resilience strategies are conceptualized. Data provide a better understanding of the traumas experienced by street children, their coping and resilience strategies. Results underscore ways to develop practices to offer psychological support, social and vocational integration based on the real needs of these children, in a perspective of social justice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child Abuse Negl.,79,,85-97,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.01.024,,#2781,Cénat 2018,,
"The body’s civilisation/decivilisation: Emotional, social, and historical tensions","Veiga, C.","In this article, I discuss the paradoxes of the body’s civilising processes in dialogue with Norbert Elias’s sociological theory. As a premise, I contend that modernity’s civilising rationality has taken the body, the senses, and emotions in such a fragmented manner that we sometimes lose sight of the dimension that body and person are indivisible. I will analyse the social consequences of the body and person dual concept. In presenting this discussion, the text is divided into three sections. The first, “Education and civilised bodies”, analyses the historical movement to standardise behaviours; the second, “Education and inferior bodies”, discusses the problem of how to civilise differences; the third, “Education and decivilised rebel bodies”, analyses the impact of social movements and the emergence of collective corporality and the body’s decivilisation process. The tension amid civilised bodies, the body and person dual concept, and the process of decivilised bodies is so strong that we are now seeing the resurgence of conservative political groups in several countries, including Brazil. This movement has been guided by reactionary demands against social achievements, and is focused directly on the corporality of populations, such as advocacy for the exclusion of immigrants from different ethnic backgrounds and colours; changes in labour rights; and the exacerbation of prejudice against the landless, the homeless, black people, women, and at-risk youths. © 2018 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.",2018,,Paedagog.

Homeless youth: Barriers and facilitators for service referrals,"Black, E.B.; Fedyszyn, I.E.; Mildred, H.; Perkin, R.; Lough, R.; Brann, P.; Ritter, C.","Young people who are homeless and experiencing mental health issues are reluctant to use relevant services for numerous reasons. Youth are also at risk of disengaging from services at times of referral to additional or alternative services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for inter-service referrals for homeless youth with mental health issues who have already engaged with a service. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with homeless youth (n = 10), homelessness support workers (n = 10), and mental health clinicians (n = 10). Barriers included: resource shortages; programs or services having inflexible entry criteria; complexity of service systems; homeless youth feeling devalued; and a lack of communication between services, for example, abrupt referrals with no follow up. Referral facilitators included: services providers offering friendly and client-centred support; supported referrals; awareness of other services; and collaboration between services. Relationships with service providers and inter-service collaboration appeared essential for successful referrals for homeless youth. These facilitating factors may be undermined by sector separation and siloing, as well as resource shortages in both the homelessness and mental health sectors. Service transitions may be conceptualised as a genuine service outcome for homeless youth, and as a basis for successful future service provision. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Eval.

The sampling method in this cross-sectional study was Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), innovative in research about hidden populations. Interviews were conducted with 307 subjects, aged 10 to 21 years. In multivariate analysis, Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used. Most of this sample were males, with no contact with school and family. Almost half of the participants had been on the street for five years or more, spending more than 15 hours per day on the streets. The prevalence of pregnancy experience was 29.3%, independently associated with being a girl, having 10 sexual partners or more in the last year, having a fixed sexual partner in the last year, and being older. The prevalence of abortion experience was 10.4%, independently associated with not living with the family, having more than two pregnancies, and being younger. The high prevalence of pregnancy and abortion experience highlights the need for the development of better sexual and reproductive health policies focused on this population. © 2018, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

Algorithmic social intervention,"Wilder, B.","Social and behavioral interventions are a critical tool for governments and communities to tackle deep-rooted societal challenges such as homelessness, disease, and poverty. However, real-world interventions are almost always plagued by limited resources and limited data, which creates a computational challenge: how can we use algorithmic techniques to enhance the targeting and delivery of social and behavioral interventions? The goal of my thesis is to provide a unified study of such questions, collectively considered under the name “algorithmic social intervention”. This proposal introduces algorithmic social intervention as a distinct area with characteristic technical challenges, presents my published research in the context of these challenges, and outlines open problems for future work. A common technical theme is decision making under uncertainty: how can we find actions which will impact a social system in desirable ways under limitations of knowledge and resources? The primary application area for my work thus far is public health, e.g. HIV or tuberculosis prevention. For instance, I have developed a series of algorithms which optimize social network interventions for HIV prevention. Two of these algorithms have been pilot-tested in collaboration with LA-area service providers for homeless youth, with preliminary results showing substantial improvement over the previously used heuristic. My work also spans other topics in infectious disease prevention and underlying algorithmic questions in robust and risk-aware submodular optimization. © 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.All right reserved.",2018,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2018-July,,5793-5794,,10.24963/ijcai.2018/840,,#2788,Wilder 2018,,
Role of Social Environmental Protective Factors on Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Among Midwestern Homeless Youth,"Tyler, K.A.; Schmitz, R.M.; Ray, C.M.","We employ a social stress framework, which examines the influence of multiple stressors (e.g., physical abuse, foster care placement) on an individual's ability to function (e.g., mental well-being), to longitudinally examine the effects of stressful life events on mental health and the role of the social environment in this process among 150 homeless youth. Results revealed that numerous stressors, such as physical abuse and running away from home more frequently, were associated with greater depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety. Having mentors and family and friends from home that youth can rely on resulted in more positive social support, which subsequently lowered the risk for depressive symptoms and anxiety at wave 2. © 2017 The Authors.

Identifying the essential competencies for resource parents to promote permanency and well-being of adolescents in care,"Patterson, D.; Day, A.; Vanderwill, L.; Willis, T.; Resko, S.; Henneman, K.; Cohick, S.","The number of teens entering foster care and those subsequently aging out, has been steadily increasing in recent years. The majority of these teens experience placement instability while in care and do not secure permanency before entering young adulthood. These adolescents often have complex needs due to trauma histories, and as a result, many of these youth struggle with unemployment, homelessness, and incarceration, and they experience chronic physical and mental health challenges as young adults. There has been limited training available to prepare resource parents to care for adolescents who have experienced chronic trauma. The current study is the first phase of a national training and development initiative to maximize placement stability and permanency of traumatized teens placed in out-of-home care. The purpose of the current study is to identify the core competencies that are deemed essential for resource parents to be successful, and then prioritize the competencies that should be included in the training. Utilizing the Delphi method, the current study generated a comprehensive list of competencies through multiple types of data collection procedures (e.g., interviews, surveys) and sources (e.g., parents, older youth, professionals, and literature and curricula reviews). Subsequently, the competencies were prioritized for inclusion in a national training by administering two rounds of a survey to an expert panel who ranked their importance. The inclusion of the competencies in the training was based on two criteria: competencies with a minimum mean score of at least 4, and those which 75% of the panelists rated at 4 or higher. Of the 215 non-duplicative competencies generated in Round One, the panelists reached consensus for inclusion of 61 in training development. Many of them focused on trauma-informed parenting, building a trusting relationship with youth, helping youth maintain a connection with their biological family and other past supportive relationships, emotional regulation skills for the parent and youth, and how to adapt to meet the youths’ unique needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

Prevalence and Correlates of Youth Homelessness in the United States,"Morton, M.H.; Dworsky, A.; Matjasko, J.L.; Curry, S.R.; Schlueter, D.; Chávez, R.; Farrell, A.F.","Purpose Unaccompanied youth homelessness is a serious concern. Response, however, has been constrained by the absence of credible data on the size and characteristics of the population and reliable means to track youth homelessness over time. We sought to address these gaps. Methods Using a nationally representative phone-based survey (N = 26,161), we solicited household and individual reports on different types of youth homelessness. We collected household reports on adolescents aged 13–17 and young adults aged 18–25, as well as self-reports from young adults aged 18–25. Follow-up interviews with a subsample (n = 150) provided additional information on youth experiences and enabled adjustment for inclusion errors. Results Over a 12-month period, approximately 3.0% of households with 13- to 17-year-olds reported explicit youth homelessness (including running away or being asked to leave) and 1.3% reported experiences that solely involved couch surfing, resulting in an overall 4.3% household prevalence of any homelessness, broadly defined. For 18- to 25-year-olds, household prevalence estimates were 5.9% for explicitly reported homelessness, 6.6% for couch surfing only, and 12.5% overall. The 12-month population prevalence estimates, available only for 18- to 25-year-olds, were 5.2%, 4.5%, and 9.7%, respectively. Incidence rates were about half as high as prevalence rates. Prevalence rates were similar across rural and nonrural counties. Higher risk of homelessness was observed among young parents; black, Hispanic, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) youth; and those who did not complete high school. Conclusions The prevalence and incidence of youth homelessness reveal a significant need for prevention and youth-centric systems and services, as well as strategies to address disproportionate risks of certain subpopulations. © 2017 The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2018,,J.

"Hospitalization among street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada: A longitudinal analysis","Chang, D.C.; Rieb, L.; Nosova, E.; Liu, Y.; Kerr, T.; DeBeck, K.","Background: Street-involved youth who use illicit drugs are at high risk for health-related harms; however, the profile of youth at greatest risk of hospitalization has not been well described. We sought to characterize hospitalization among street-involved youth who use illicit drugs and identify the most frequent medical reasons for hospitalization among this population. Methods: From January 2005 to May 2016, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with hospitalization. Results: Among 1216 participants, 373 (30.7%) individuals reported hospitalization in the previous 6 months at some point during the study period. The top three reported medical reasons for hospital admission were the following: mental illness (37.77%), physical trauma (12.77%), and drug-related issues (12.59%). Factors significantly associated with hospitalization were the following: past diagnosis of a mental illness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.85; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.47-2.33), frequent cocaine use (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI 1.37-3.37), non-fatal overdose (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI 1.37-2.25), and homelessness (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.16-1.68) (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Findings suggest that mental illness is a key driver of hospitalization among our sample.

Service and policy considerations when working with highly mobile homeless youth: Perspectives from the frontlines,"Aykanian, A.","This qualitative study explores providers’ experiences working with geographically mobile homeless youth in an area comprising small cities, suburban towns, and rural communities. In-depth interviews were conducted with eight homeless service providers in New York's Capital Region. The analysis centered on how providers understand the mobility of homeless youth and how the homeless service system impacts this mobility. Participants described mobility as an impulsive coping strategy, a process greatly influenced by service system and policy limitations, and a phenomenon that challenges traditional engagement strategies. Findings suggest opportunities for strengthening the service system through trauma-informed programming and policy, increased coordination with government entities, and assessing gaps in key services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child.

The impact of early childbirth on socioeconomic outcomes and risk indicators of females transitioning out of foster care,"Shpiegel, S.; Cascardi, M.","Few studies have documented the relationship between early childbirth and the adjustment of females transitioning out of foster care. In this study, data from the National Youth in Transition Database were used to evaluate the associations between childbirth at three time points (prior to age 17, ages 17–19, and ages 19–21) and females’ socioeconomic outcomes and risk indicators at age 21 (n = 3173). Findings revealed that over 40% of females had given birth at least once by age 21, with a substantial increase in birth rates from adolescence to early adulthood. Multivariate analyses showed that childbirth between ages 17 and 19 and between ages 19 and 21 was associated with decreased likelihood of obtaining a high school diploma/GED or higher. However, only most recent childbirth (between ages 19 and 21) was associated with decreased likelihood of employment and increased likelihood of receiving public assistance. Contrary to the hypothesis, childbirth was unrelated to homelessness, substance abuse referrals and incarceration at age 21, once earlier presence of such risks was taken into account. Overall, while childbirth between ages 19 and 21 was linked to negative socioeconomic outcomes as females entered young adulthood, earlier births did not appear to confer a unique, prospective risk for the majority of the variables studied. These findings underscore the importance of expanding specialized services designed to promote educational and vocational opportunities for young mothers transitioning out of foster care, especially in the first years following childbirth. The importance of targeting foster youth for pregnancy prevention programs will also be discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Child. Youth Serv.

Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Homeless Young Adults: The Importance of Victimization Experiences in Childhood and Once Homeless,"Kim, Y; Bender, K; Ferguson, KM; Begun, S; DiNitto, DM","Homelessness itself is traumatic, and more than half of homeless young adults have also experienced abuse as children and/or victimization while homeless. These experiences increase the likelihood of developing trauma-related symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few studies have, however, examined correlates of trauma and PTSD to identify targets for prevention and intervention. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess whether child abuse, victimization once homeless, features of homelessness (duration and transience), and personal resilience (self-efficacy and social connectedness) were associated with trauma and PTSD among 600 homeless young adults. Compared with those who had not experienced trauma, those who had were more likely to have been physically and/or sexually abused in childhood and physically victimized once homeless. Compared with those who had not experienced trauma, those who had experienced trauma and met criteria for PTSD were more likely to have been physically and/or sexually abused in childhood and physically and/or sexually victimized once homeless, and to have lower self-efficacy and social connectedness.

Development of a Shelter-based Health Empowerment Program for Pregnant and Parenting Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"O'Brien, JRG; Brar, P; Worley, J; Woodlee, CH; Kelly, ED; So, MR; McRee, AL; Mehus, CJ","Background: Pregnancy and parenthood are common among youth experiencing homelessness and are associated with significant health risk for both parent and child. Yet, little is known regarding how to best promote health among this vulnerable population. Objectives: To understand stakeholder perceptions of needs and factors required for successful implementation of a shelter-based health empowerment program for pregnant and parenting youth experiencing homelessness and their children. Methods: Applying frameworks from implementation sci-ence, we conducted interviews and focus groups with three groups of stakeholders (youth experiencing homelessness [n = 17], shelter staff [n = 8], community experts [n = 5]). We used qualitative content analysis to identify program content areas and design elements required for successful implementation. We then used a consensus-building process to engage community stakeholders in selecting and adapting an evidence-informed intervention. Results: Stakeholders described several desired content areas for a group-based curriculum: sexual and reproductive health, mental health and child health. With respect to pro-gram design, stakeholders emphasized adaptability; a strengths-based, culturally responsive, and trauma-informed approach; a skills-oriented focus; staff training; access to health care; and the integration of youth voices. Driven by these findings, our community-based team proposed a health empowerment program with three elements: 1) a weekly health empowerment group, 2) health training and support for shelter staff, and 3) shelter-based health care services.

"Queer/y/ing pathways through youth homelessness: becoming, being and leaving LGBTQI plus youth homelessness","Quilty, A; Norris, M","This article extends Clapham's (2002) concept of 'housing pathways' to explore the nature of specific youth homelessness associated with diverse LGBTQI+ identities. Drawing on in-depth interviews with homeless LGBTQI+youth in Ireland we offer a queer consideration of the structural challenges and agentic potentialities of young people's housing pathways. Building on these young people's experiences of becoming, being and leaving homelessness our queering process focuses on three phenomena: queer temporalities, queer liminalities and queer kinships. We argue that due to their evolving sexualities and gender identities 'housing and home' have distinctive meanings for LGBTQI+youth. These meanings prioritise safe, non-homophobic/transphobic spaces, in which they can be themselves without the pressure to conceal their evolving identities or conform to heteronormative expectations. We suggest these meanings inform pathways into, through and out of homelessness and may contribute to higher rates of homelessness among LGBTQI+youth. Finally, we argue these queerly informed understandings increase knowledge of how proactive interventions might best be framed.",2022,,HOUSING STUDIES,,,,WOS:000898272200001,10.1080/02673037.2022.2141204,,#2811,Quilty 2022,,
Improving services for youth survivors of commercial sexual exploitation: Insights from interventions with other high-risk youth,"O'Brien, J; Finkelhor, D; Jones, L","Background: There have been initiatives to develop innovative services for commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC), but there are currently no intervention strategies that have been rigorously evaluated. However, a range of evidence-based interventions have been identified for other problems that frequently co-occur with CSEC. As intervention programs for victims of CSEC develop, it is important to critically examine the research on interventions for these associated problems to ensure that what is borrowed, adapted, or prioritized is informed by research, and likely to best address the needs of victims.Objective: The current review examines evidence-based interventions from related social problem fields that may have useful content for victims of CSEC. Existing systematic reviews were primarily used for this review; however, rigorous and large-scale randomized controlled trials were also included. In total, 33 articles were included. Articles were identified via search engine (e.g., PsychInfo) and reference mining.Review: Interventions for adolescent substance use, delinquency, trauma, school dropout, and running away are reviewed for their content and evidence base. Opportunities for integration of CSEC content are discussed using current extant literature.Discussion: The most promising practices from related fields include mentorship, multisystemic treatment (MST), family programming/therapy, and kinship foster care. Skill-based interventions (e.g., CBT) have been found to be a particularly effective mental health intervention for youth with similar sequelae to victims of CSEC.

Cognitive coping in relation to self-determination and quality of life in homeless young adults,"Altena, AM; Boersma, SN; Beijersbergen, MD; Wolf, JRLM","The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between cognitive coping strategies and the experience of autonomy, competence, relatedness and quality of life in homeless young adults. The sample consisted of 251 young adults (age 18 to 25) who had just entered a Dutch shelter facility. In addition, moderating effects of cognitive coping in the relationship between life stressors and the outcomes were examined. The analyses were conducted by means of linear regression. Our results indicated that adaptive cognitive coping strategies were related to the constructs of self-determination. Both adaptive and maladaptive cognitive coping strategies were related to quality of life. Positive reappraisal and positive refocusing moderated the relationship between life stressors and the outcomes. The implications of interventions will be discussed.

Transitioning to independent living: Experiences of homeless young adults in rapid rehousing,"Gurdak, K; Bond, L; Padgett, D; Petering, R","Rapid rehousing (RRH) is an intervention that is being adopted nationally to assist adolescents and emerging adults who are homeless. RRH provides short-term rental assistance for independent scattered-site housing, in addition to an array of support services for approximately 12-24 months. The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of young adults (18-23 years old) who had previously been homeless and who were enrolled in RRH programs set in two urban Northeastern cities, and their subsequent preparedness for independent living. Our sample mostly consisted of non-Hispanic Black females, many of whom identified as LGBTQ. Semi-structured interviews (n = 15) were conducted after participants had been in the program for nine months -three months prior to their initial program completion date. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: the importance of tangible support, communication among all parties: staff lead the way, and ""I gotta start learning to do it on my own "". These domains provided essential assistance for young people to attain their goals and through this process they learned skills to live independently and transition into adulthood. These findings suggest that rapid rehousing programs and service providers should focus on these domains to facilitate successful transition to independent living for this population.",2022,,EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING,92,,,WOS:000792707600015,10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2022.102076,,#2815,Gurdak 2022,,

Both samples were from a mid-Atlantic state with youth currently in-care residing in rural jurisdictions and former foster youth residing in the state's largest urban jurisdiction. A cross-sectional design utilizing paper and web-based surveys was used to collect data. Findings indicate youth in-care are consuming substances that are on average with national prevalence statistics. However, former foster youth are consuming substances at alarmingly high rates well above the national prevalence.

Prevalence of mental disorders among people who are homeless: An umbrella review,"Hossain, MM; Sultana, A; Tasnim, S; Fan, QP; Ma, P; McKyer, ELJ; Purohit, N","Background:Homelessness is a major problem that critically impacts the mental health and well-being of the affected individuals. This umbrella review aimed to evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence of mental disorders among homeless people from evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses.Methods:We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews. We searched 12 major databases and additional sources to identify systematically conducted reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of mental disorders among homeless populations.Results:We evaluated 1,277 citations and found 15 reviews meeting our criteria. Most studies were conducted among high-income countries with samples from different age groups. Studies reported high prevalence rates of depressive and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia spectrum and psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behavior, bipolar and mood disorders, neurocognitive disorders and other mental disorders among homeless people. Moreover, studies also reported a high burden of co-occurring mental and physical health problems among the homeless experiencing mental disorders.Conclusion:This umbrella review synthesized the current evidence on the epidemiological burden of mental disorders in homelessness.

'This is the beginning of the new me': process evaluation of a group fitness intervention to promote wellbeing in formerly homeless individuals,"Sofija, E; Plugge, M; Wiseman, N; Harris, N","Background: Homelessness is a persistent social issue with diverse impacts reaching far beyond individuals. Strategies and research concerning homelessness and health have largely focused on the risk factors and weaknesses of individuals. Such preoccupation has meant the potential strengths and resources within individuals, and so-called strength-based approaches have received less attention. Consequently, understanding how to effectively work with and engage this population in such interventions is limited.Methods: The current study presents a process evaluation of an 8-week group fitness intervention in a supportive housing facility. The purpose of the intervention was to increase tenants' physical activity together with opportunities for social interaction and support to, in turn, improve physical and mental wellbeing, and ultimately help individuals re-engage in their community. The evaluation focused on seven key components: context, recruitment, reach/participation, dose delivered, dose received, satisfaction/feedback and fidelity. Data collection methods included observation, attendance records and participant and staff interviews.Results: Findings indicate the intervention was appropriate, well delivered, and enjoyed by participants who highlighted the importance of the sessions for their mental wellbeing and social inclusion. The intervention being conducted on site, the trainers' ability to build good rapport with participants together with the supportive environment they created were central to successful implementation.Conclusion: Group fitness sessions represent a promising intervention to improve wellbeing of this population. However, the need for more personalised care when delivering fitness sessions, due to the complexity of health issues prevalent in this population, was identified. This has implications for already limited resources, including staffing. Strategies to address this are required to ensure the continuity of fitness programs.

Homelessness among youth who identify as LGBTQ plus : A systematic review,"McCann, E; Brown, M","Aims and objectives To explore homelessness among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning plus (LGBTQ+) youth and to identify their support and care requirements. Background LGBTQ+ youth face many health and societal challenges including issues related to homelessness. Design A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies. Methods A search of relevant electronic databases was carried out and included the dates August 2008-August 2018 and limited to academic journals and peer-reviewed empirical studies written in English. Included studies specifically addressed the homeless experiences of youth aged 13-24 years old who identified as LGBTQ+. The PRISMA checklist was used in the review. A quality assessment instrument was used to review all of the selected papers and narrative methods utilised in the synthesis of the research evidence. Results The search resulted in 319 papers, and after applying distinct inclusion criteria, a total of 14 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Following analysis, the four main themes identified were stigma, discrimination and exclusion; mental health issues and substance use; sexual risks and vulnerability; and interventions and supports. Conclusion LGBTQ+ homeless youth is a major public health concern that has significant consequences for a young person's physical and psychosocial well-being. Relevance to clinical practice Practitioners need to be aware of the specific health and support requirements of LGBTQ+ youth in relation to homelessness.

Understanding the relation between school-violence and school-climate might help towards the development of support for homeless students.Objective: Examine the association between school-climate components, homelessness and school discriminatory bullying, behavioral victimization and weapon involvement at the student and school levels.Participants: 389,569 high school students and 811 schools from a representative California statewide sample (2011-2013).Methods: Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine differences between the subgroups of homeless students as compared to nonhomeless students. Hierarchical logistic regressions were conducted to examine the relation between school-climate and discriminatory bullying, behavioral victimization and weapon involvement in school at the individual level, and hierarchical linear regressions were conducted at the school level.Results: At the student level adding school-climate dimensions contributed significantly to each outcome. Positive school-climate was associated with lower rates of all school-violence outcomes. Safety, positive relationship and connectedness were all significantly negatively associated with the outcomes, especially safety. At the school level, the partial linear regression coefficient of school-climate is negative and significantly (p < .001) decreases discriminatory bullying, behavioral discrimination and gun involvement.Conclusion: Positive school-climate serves as a protective factor for homeless students with regards to school violence outcomes.

"Identifying early intervention opportunities for illicit stimulant use: A cross-sectional study of factors associated with illicit stimulant use among young people accessing integrated youth services in British Columbia, Canada","Kreim, S; Marchand, K; Mallia, E; Dubras, R; McMaster, WR; Tee, K; Mathias, S; Barbic, S","Introduction: Illicit stimulant (cocaine and/or amphetamine) use among young people aged 12-24 is a public health priority given that substance use initiation tends to peak in this developmental period and significant associated immediate and long-term harms are associated with its use. Young people using stimulants must be engaged in services as early as possible to reduce these harms. To inform early intervention opportunities, this study aimed to identify the risk/protective factors associated with illicit stimulant use among young people. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on routinely collected self-reported data among young people accessing integrated youth services in British Columbia (Canada) between April 2018 and January 2022. Data were collected on young peoples' socio-demographic characteristics, and social, behavioral, and health profiles. Variable selection was guided by established risk/protective factors for substance use among young people. The study used multivariable logistic regression to identify risk/protective factors that were independently associated with past 30-day illicit stimulant use. Results: The analytic sample included n = 5620 young people aged 12-24 and a total of 163 (2.9 %) reported past 30-day illicit cocaine and/or amphetamine use. Demographic characteristics that were independently associated with illicit stimulant use included older age (aOR = 1.27, 95 % CI = 1.17-1.38) and gender identity as man vs woman (aOR = 1.71, 95 % CI = 1.10-2.70). Social and environmental risk factors included recently witnessing or experiencing violence (aOR = 2.32, 95 % CI = 1.47-3.68) and higher past-year crime/violent behaviors score (aOR = 1.39, 95 % CI = 1.13-1.69). Finally, regular alcohol (aOR = 6.90, 95 % CI = 2.36-25.42), regular (aOR = 3.74, 95 % CI = 1.95-7.54) or social (aOR = 3.06, 95 % CI = 1.44-6.60) tobacco use, and lifetime hallucinogen (aOR = 3.24, 95 % CI = 1.8-5.91) and ecstasy/MDMA (aOR = 2.53, 95 % CI = 1.48-4.39) use were also statistically significant risk factors. Conclusions: These risk/protective factors support identification of young people who may benefit from further screening, assessment, and treatment for illicit stimulant use.

However, there is a dearth of studies on the prevalence and factors associated with problematic substance use among street youth in Ethiopia. ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of problematic substance use and identify its associated factors among street youth. MethodsThis community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between June and July 2020. A total of 252 participants were included in this study. Systematic random sampling was used to recruit participants. Cut down, annoyed, guilty feeling, and eye opening-adapted to include drugs (CAGE-AIDs) were used to assess problematic substance use. The data were entered into epidata and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Logistic regression with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to show the strength of association. A p-value < 0.5 was statistically significant. ResultsThe prevalence of problematic substance use was 55.8%, 95% CI (49-63%).

A text message intervention for quitting cigarette smoking among young adults experiencing homelessness: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,"Tucker, JS; Pedersen, ER; Linnemayr, S; Shadel, WG; DeYoreo, M; Zutshi, R","Background Cigarette smoking is much more prevalent among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population of adolescents and young adults. Although many young homeless smokers are motivated to quit, there are no empirically-evaluated smoking cessation programs for this population. It is important that any such program address the factors known to be associated with quitting-related outcomes among homeless young people, to provide ongoing support in a way that accommodates the mobility of this population, and does not rely on scarce service provider resources for its delivery. The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test a text messaging-based intervention (TMI), as an adjunct to brief cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches, to help homeless young people who want to quit smoking. Methods/design This pilot study will utilize a cluster cross-over randomized controlled design with up to 80 current smokers who desire to quit and are recruited from three drop-in centers serving young people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. All participants will be provided with a minimum standard of care: a 30-min group-based smoking cessation counseling session and free nicotine replacement. Half of these smokers will then also receive the TMI, as an adjunct to this standard care, which will provide 6 weeks of ongoing support for quitting. This support includes continued and more intensive education regarding nicotine dependence, quitting smoking, and relapse; does not require additional agency resources; can be available ""on demand"" to users; and includes features to personalize the quitting experience. This study will investigate whether receiving the TMI adjunct to standard smoking cessation care results in greater reductions in cigarette smoking compared to standard care alone over a 3-month period. Discussion This study has the potential to address an important gap in the clinical research literature on cigarette smoking cessation and provide empirical support for using a TMI to provide ongoing assistance and support for quitting among young smokers experiencing homelessness.

The intersection of housing and mental well-being: Examining the needs of formerly homeless young adults transitioning to stable housing,"Mercado, M; Marroquín, JM; Ferguson, KM; Bender, K; Shelton, J; Prock, KA; Santa Maria, D; Hsu, HT; Narendorf, SC; Petering, R; Barman-Adhikari, A","We examine the challenges formerly homeless young adults (FHYAs) face after they transition out of homelessness. Considering the adversities FHYAs face, it is unclear how transitioning to stable housing may affect their mental well-being or what types of stressors they may experience once housed. This study investigates the social environment young adults encounter in their transition to stable housing and examines trauma and social coping predictors of mental health symptoms in a sample of FHYAs to generate new knowledge for better intervening to meet their needs. Data were obtained from REALYST, a national research collaborative comprised of interdisciplinary researchers investigating young adults' (ages 18-26) experiences with homelessness. Cross-sectional data for 1426 young adults experiencing homelessness were collected from 2016 to 2017 across seven cities in the United States (i.e., Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Houston, San Jose, St. Louis, and New York City). The analytical sub-sample for this study consisted of 173 FHYAs who were housed in their own apartment (via voucher from Housing and Urban Development or another source) or in transitional living programs during their participation in the study. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to examine the influence of trauma and social coping strategies on indicators of mental well-being. Findings indicated that higher adversity scores and higher mental health help-seeking intentions were positively associated with higher levels of stress, psychological distress, and depression severity. Higher level of social coping was associated with lower levels of depression severity. Logistic regression results showed that young adults with higher adversity scores had higher odds of reporting clinical levels of post-traumatic symptoms. The study implications suggest that FHYAs who transition to stable housing continue to need support navigating and coping with stressful life events; and interventions that help FHYAs develop strong networks of social supports are needed to promote positive mental well-being.",2021,,SSM-POPULATION HEALTH,14,,,WOS:000661125200010,10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100775,,#2833,Mercado 2021,,
Subgroups of Dutch homeless young adults based on risk- and protective factors for quality of life: Results of a latent class analysis,"Altena, AM; Beijersbergen, MD; Vermunt, JK; Wolf, JRLM","It is important to gain more insight into specific subgroups of homeless young adults (HYA) to enable the development of tailored interventions that adequately meet their diverse needs and to improve their quality of life. Within a heterogeneous sample of HYA, we investigated whether subgroups are distinguishable based on risk- and protective factors for quality of life. In addition, differences between subgroups were examined regarding the socio-demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. A total of 393 HYA using shelter facilities in the Netherlands were approached to participate, between December 2011 and March 2013. Structured face-to-face interviews were administered approximately 2weeks after shelter admission by trained research assistants. A latent class analysis was conducted to empirically distinguish 251 HYA in subgroups based on common risk factors (former abuse, victimisation, psychological symptoms and substance use) and protective factors (resilience, family and social support and perceived health status). Additional analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used to compare subgroups on socio-demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. The latent class analysis yielded four highly interpretable subgroups: the at-risk subgroup, the high-risk and least protected subgroup, the low-risk subgroup and the higher functioning and protected subgroup. Subgroups of HYA with lower scores in risk factors showed higher scores in protective factors, the adaptive cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. Our findings confirm the need for targeted and tailored interventions for specific subgroups of HYA.

Predicting Movement of Homeless Young Adults: Artificial Neural Networks and Generalized Linear Models,"Helderop, E; Ferguson, KM; Grubesic, TH; Bender, K","Objective: Previous research has indicated high rates of intercity movement among homeless young adults (HYAs) for a variety of prosocial (e.g., avoiding domestic violence and seeking new employment opportunities) and antisocial (e.g., following drug supplies and avoiding law enforcement) reasons. The complicated mixture of individual circumstances associated with transience has made it difficult to predict features of transience, such as distance traveled and move frequency. Method: This study describes a method to build an artificial neural network (ANN) that predicts distance traveled and compares the results of that ANN to a generalized linear regression. Results: The ANN more accurately predicts distance traveled than does the linear statistical model and advances the development of approaches to predict complicated human phenomena.

'Meeting them where they are at': A practice note on implementation of the Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention in an emergency family homeless shelter,"Snyder, SE; Wenocur, K","Families experiencing homelessness report higher rates of traumatic exposure than the general population, and traumatic experiences can often be precipitating factors for entrance into a homeless shelter. Emergency shelter is meant to be a brief, temporary housing intervention to support families toward more stable and permanent living arrangements. Beyond this ecological intervention, there is a frequently unmet need for trauma-specific mental health services. Further still, psychosocial interventions to support sheltered families should be sensitive to both the trauma-specific needs of this population and the constraints of the shelter setting. The Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI) is a brief, secondary prevention protocol that aims to prevent PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event, with research demonstrating its effectiveness in acute care settings such as child advocacy centres and emergency departments.

For those youth involved in public sector systems of care, reports of SU are consistently high compared to general populations. These public sector services systems of care include mental health, juvenile justice, child welfare, homeless intervention services, as well as SU service systems. In addition, minority and marginalized youth tend to report disproportionately high SU. As an example, in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, youth who are Native Hawaiian (NH), Micronesian, or who identify as sexual or gender minorities not only report elevated rates of SU, but are overrepresented in public sectors. In order to reduce youth SU health disparities, access to and quality of the system of care for youth must improve. To inform systems change, this needs assessment study used qualitative methods to engage professionals in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai working within public sectors that may intersect with youth SU service system of care.

A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation.Methods: Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (n = 120), or supportive services alone (n = 120). The ""Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention"" (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W >= 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

Early intervention for children with intellectual and developmental disability using drama therapy techniques,"Wu, JJ; Chen, KQ; Ma, Y; Vomocilová, J","A total of 30 sessions of group drama therapy were carried out regularly for 10 homeless children aged 3-6 years old with mild to severe intellectual and developmental disability to examine the effectiveness of drama therapy techniques in early intervention. Universal drama therapy approaches included sensory play, body games, sounds, stories, role playing, improvisation by embedding techniques within dramatic activities and working with multifarious materials. By conducting questionnaire survey, researchers collected responses of the observers who witnessed the sessions in field. Research findings from progress monitoring indicated child participants concentrated on the process of group drama therapy and spontaneously participated in peer interaction. Child participants increased and maintained their rates of communication and cooperation during intervention and afterwards. Some other dimensions, including creativity, flexibility, imagination and using social skills also increased. Children were perceived as happy in group drama therapy activities accompanied by self-exploration and getting to know others.",2020,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,109,,,WOS:000514253500006,10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104689,,#2843,Wu 2020,,
"Construct, Concurrent, and Real-World Predictive Validity of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation (DERS-18) Among Young Adults with History of Homelessness","Semborski, S; Henwood, B; Rhoades, H; Mason, T; Wenzel, S; Rice, E","Skills in emotional regulation are vitally important for enabling homeless young adults to navigate the complex and chaotic settings associated with homelessness. The current study seeks to test the construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) in a sample of formerly and currently homeless young adults. Data come from a study of HIV risk among young adults who have experienced homelessness, including both those currently experiencing homelessness (n = 99) and in permanent housing (n = 120), collected between 2017 and 2019 in Los Angeles, CA. Structural Equation Modeling was used to complete Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Path Models focused on the relationship between mental health symptomatology and emotional regulation. Linear regression models tested the link between affective intensity and instability and the DERS-18. Model fit indices pointed to the five-factor solution of the DERS-18, excluding the Awareness subscale. Clinical scores of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were found to have a significant, positive correlation with DERS. Both intensity and instability of negative affect were associated with greater difficulty in emotional regulation, while the increased intensity of positive affect was associated with increased skills in emotional regulation. This study addressed several gaps in both homelessness and emotional regulation literature. The DERS-18 was found to have construct, concurrent, and predictive validity in our sample. Future work should consider the use of the DERS-18 to assess skills in emotional regulation, understand outcomes, and better tailor interventions for young adults who have experienced homelessness.",2021,,PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT,33,5,385-394,WOS:000648519700002,10.1037/pas0000991,,#2845,Semborski 2021,,
Oooh She's a Little Runaway: Examining Invariance in Runaway Youth Trajectories by Developmental and Life-Course Risk Factors and Gender,"Jeanis, MN; Fox, BH; Jennings, WG; Perkins, R; Liberto, A","Runaway behavior is incredibly prevalent among youth and has been associated with a host of negative distal outcomes to include repeat running, victimization, and future offending. Notably, girls run away at higher frequencies than boys, and the experiences, motivations, and effects of running away appear to vary by gender. However, relatively little is known regarding the risk factors associated with runaways, or whether these risk factors are invariant by gender or frequency of runaway behavior. Using a group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) on a sample of youth runaways in Florida, this study aims to identify the distinct trajectories of runaway events throughout adolescence, and whether risk factors implicated in developmental and life-course criminology (DLC) theories are applicable to runaways of varying frequency and gender. Results of the GBTM identified two distinct runaway trajectories (chronic and low rate runaway groups) and, as such, establishes the first empirical definition for chronic runaway status. In addition, findings indicate both symmetry and variance in runaway behavior and risk factors by gender and runaway frequency. These findings underscore the applicability of DLC theory to high-risk youth beyond juvenile offenders and the need for more individualized prevention and intervention strategies tailored to the distinct risk factors among runaway youth, particularly for girls and chronic runaways.",2020,,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND LIFE-COURSE CRIMINOLOGY,6,4,398-423,WOS:000581669100001,10.1007/s40865-020-00155-3,,#2846,Jeanis 2020,,
Macro interventions and their influence on individual and community well-being,"Ferguson, KM; Teixeira, S; Wernick, LJ; Burghardt, S","The Summary: Due to the focus of micro-practice interventions on clinical outcomes and macro-practice interventions on structural outcomes, limited research exists on the clinical benefits resulting from clients' involvement in macro therapeutic interventions (i.e. structural interventions that target community, organizational, systems, and/or policy-level change and which also have clinical benefits to clients or consumers). In response to this knowledge gap, the authors present four case studies of macro therapeutic interventions in the areas of social enterprise creation, community-based participatory research, transformative organizing, and community-based partnerships. Findings Collectively, these interventions draw from community, economic, and social development theory, empowerment theory, feminist theory, and critical theory. The authors synthesize the key intervention components across case studies that contribute to clinical and collective empowerment outcomes.

A Traumagenic Social Ecological Framework for Understanding and Intervening with Sex Trafficked Children and Youth,"Finigan-Carr, NM; Johnson, MH; Pullmann, MD; Stewart, CJ; Fromknecht, AE","Sex trafficking of children and youth is receiving significant attention from practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. Recognition that sex trafficking constitutes a form of child abuse has increased; however, there is still a need for a theoretical framework that provides direction on how best to intervene and conduct research into this phenomenon. In this article, we present a traumagenic social ecological framework of child sex trafficking that examines perceived social norms, societal and environmental factors, extended and intimate relationships, and personal characteristics that influence the ecological setting in which the child is embedded. Utilizing a four-tier approach, our framework focuses on how factors at each level interact and contribute to youths' vulnerability for sex trafficking through mechanisms including social norms. This allows us to move beyond individualistic explanations of why sex trafficking occurs and consider more complex relationships. This framework is also useful to identify and group intervention strategies on the basis of social ecological level, as each level can be thought of as both a level of influence and a key point for prevention. In addition, interventions that have an impact on all levels of the social ecological framework are encouraged in order to successfully prevent child sex trafficking.",2019,,CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL WORK JOURNAL,36,1,49-63,WOS:000463780300007,10.1007/s10560-018-0588-7,,#2848,Finigan-Carr 2019,,
Prevention and Intervention Strategies for the Sexual Abuse and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Who Run Away from Foster Care: A Scoping Review,"Garcia, A; Crosland, K; Reyes, C; del Vecchio, M; Pannone, C","Literature on human trafficking suggests the vulnerability to commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) and child sexual abuse (CSA) changes by the prevalence of certain risk factors (e.g., runaway), trafficker-used lures (e.g., isolation), and the environmental conditions present at the time of victimization (e.g., foster care). Often, youth in foster care are at high risk for CSEC and CSA victimization associated with runaway instances. This scoping review aims to identify prevention and intervention strategies for CSEC/CSA of youth who run away from foster care. PRISMA scoping review guidelines were followed to review the literature across two search parameters (CSEC; CSA). An electronic review was conducted between August 2022 and January 2023 across four databases: PubMed, SAGE Journals Online, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. The CSEC and CSA search parameters comprised three domains (sexual exploitation, foster care, and runaway; sexual abuse, foster care, and runaway, respectively). Literature published between 2012 and 2022 was included regardless of the methodological approach. Literature not concerning youth who run from foster care was excluded. Database searches yielded 206 publications for CSEC and 351 for CSA, reduced to 185 and 212, respectively, after removing duplicates. Seventy-one articles were identified, of which, 64 articles (28 CSEC, 36 CSA) were categorized as prevention strategies and seven (five CSEC, two CSA) as interventions. The intersection and dual victimization of CSEC and CSA of youth who run away from foster care are discussed.

Intervention in a Real-Life Context: Therapeutic Space in Poverty-Aware Social Work,"Saar-Heiman, Y; Krumer-Nevo, M; Lavie-Ajayi, M","The spatial aspects of therapeutic intervention receive marginal attention in the practice and discourse of therapeutic professions. Currently, influenced by the classic Freudian tradition, the central therapeutic space of social workers and psychologists is the agency and the office. Despite the fact that models of home therapy have been developed over the years, its practice has remained marginal in the professional discourse. This article introduces the concept of intervention in a real-life context as a theoretical and practical framework for work with people in poverty that takes place outside the agency. The article is based on a qualitative study that examined the ongoing experiences of nine women who participated in an intervention programme based on the poverty-aware social work paradigm. The findings revealed that intervention in a real-life context takes place in four major realms: the home space, in which meetings were held regularly; the utilisation-of-rights space; the emergency space; and the professional-friendly space. The discussion sheds light on intervention in a real-life context as a means to practise the psychodynamic concept of holding in working with people who live in poverty.",2018,,BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK,48,2,321-338,WOS:000428440800004,10.1093/bjsw/bcx054,,#2850,Saar-Heiman 2018,,
Substance Use among Street-Connected Children and Adolescents in Ghana and South Africa: A Cross-Country Comparison Study,"Asante, KO; Nefale, MT","Using two cross-sectional surveys with a purposive sample of 376 homeless children and adolescents in both Ghana and South Africa, this study was conducted to examine the prevalence, sociodemographic and psychosocial correlates of substance use among street children and adolescents. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on substance use, sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that street-connected adolescents in Ghana reported higher prevalence of lifetime alcohol use and past-month alcohol use than those in South Africa. The protective effect of male gender was not observed in South Africa but significantly more pronounced in Ghana for all substances except past-month marijuana use. Sexual assault, indirect sexual victimization, physical beating, robbery, assault with a weapon and survival sex increased the odds of lifetime alcohol use and past-month alcohol use in Ghana. However, in South Africa, only robbery and assault with a weapon increased the odds of lifetime alcohol use while robbery and sexual assault increased the odds of past-month alcohol use. These results have implications for the development of harm reduction interventions, taking into consideration both the psychosocial and cultural context of substance use.",2021,,BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES,11,3,,WOS:000633326500001,10.3390/bs11030028,,#2851,Asante 2021,,
Homeless Men Living in Transitional Housing: The BrainWise Program and Improvements in Executive Functions and Coping Self-Efficacy,"Welsh, M; Barry, PG; Jacobs, AA; Beddes, LA","We describe an innovative approach to teaching homeless men the critical thinking skills underlying adaptive decision making and self-regulation needed to bolster resilience in the face of multiple and complex personal challenges. Single men living in a transitional housing facility for the homeless were taught the BrainWise curriculum (n = 210) along with other educational, career, and life skills programs, and tested 4 months later. This group was compared with a smaller control group (n = 61) of men from the same and similar facilities. Outcomes were measured through self-reports of executive functions (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]), problem solving (Wasik Problem Solving Rating Scale [WPSRS]), coping (Coping Self-Efficacy [CSE]), and knowledge of the thinking skills taught through BrainWise (BrainWise Knowledge Survey [BKS]). All measures showed adequate internal consistency reliability and less strong, but significant, test-retest stability. As expected, self-reported skills in executive function, coping self-efficacy, problem solving, and BrainWise knowledge covaried in predictable ways. The attrition between the pretest and posttest was not predicted by any of the major outcome measures. The sample of 108 men in the Treatment Group who were still in the program 4 months later exhibited significant improvements on all BRIEF composites and subscales, CSE, and the BKS, but not on the WPSRS. In contrast, the remaining 37 Control Group men showed many fewer improvements in the BRIEF scores and a decrease in the WPSRS score. The results suggest the efficacy of BrainWise and measurement of these skills in the vulnerable population of homeless individuals; however, challenges of this type of research and limitations of this study are discussed.",2018,,SAGE OPEN,8,2,,WOS:000430205900001,10.1177/2158244018769138,,#2852,Welsh 2018,,

Emergency Department Utilization by Adolescents Experiencing Homelessness in Massachusetts,"Giannouchos, TV; Gary, JC; Anyatonwu, S; Kum, HC","Background:Adolescents who experience homelessness rely heavily on emergency departments (EDs) for their health care.Objectives:This study estimates the relationship between homelessness and ED use and identifies the sociodemographic, clinical, visit-level, and contextual factors associated with multiple ED visits among adolescents experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts.Research Design:We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Emergency Department Databases on all outpatient ED visits in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2016. We included all adolescents who were 11-21 years old. We estimated the association between homelessness and ED utilization and investigated predictors of multiple ED visits among adolescents who experience homelessness using multivariate logistic and negative binomial regressions.Results:Our study included 1,196,036 adolescents, of whom about 0.8% experienced homelessness and this subset of adolescents accounted for 2.2% of all ED visits. Compared with those with stable housing, adolescents who were homeless were mostly covered through Medicaid (P<0.001), diagnosed with 1 or more comorbidities (P<0.001), and visited the ED at least once for reasons related to mental health; substance and alcohol use; pregnancy; respiratory distress; urinary and sexually transmitted infections; and skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases (P<0.001). Homeless experience was associated with multiple ED visits (incidence rate ratio=1.18; 95% confidence intervals, 1.16-1.19) and frequent ED use (4 or more ED visits) (adjusted odds ratio=2.21; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-2.37). Factors related to clinical complexity and Medicaid compared with lack of coverage were also significant predictors of elevated ED utilization within the cohort experiencing homelessness.Conclusions:Adolescents who experience homelessness exhibit higher ED use compared with those with stable housing, particularly those with aggravated comorbidities and chronic conditions.

Implementation of a screening tool for child sex trafficking among youth presenting to the emergency department-A quality improvement initiative,"Peterson, LJ; Foell, R; Lunos, S; Heisterkamp, B; Greenbaum, VJ; Harper, NS","Background: Identification of sex-trafficked youth in the emergency department (ED) is difficult and routine screening is uncommon. Objectives: Our Quality Improvement (QI) Project aimed to increase ED screening and identification of high-risk youth using the Short Screen for Child Sex Trafficking (SSCST).Participants: Youth (11 through 17 years) seeking care at two metropolitan EDs with a high-risk chief complaint triggering a best practice alert (BPA).Methods: A BPA prompted administration of the SSCST and referral of screen 'positive' youth for comprehensive evaluation for child sex trafficking by the forensic nurse examiner (FNE). Targeted QI interventions defined three study periods (SP). Outcomes measures included screening 50% of high-risk youth with 50% of those youth referred for FNE evaluation.Results: Over three study periods, 5454/13,956 (39.1%) youth triggered a BPA for high-risk chief complaint; 4354 (78.6%) received the SSCST screen; 1336 (76.0%) of screen-positive youth were referred for FNE evaluation. Outcomes measures were exceeded during all three study periods. SSCST modifications to increase specificity led to a significant decrease in the percentage of positive screens (42.8% SP1 vs 29.4% SP3). Financial programmatic support and further staff training led to an increase in FNE evaluations (86.4 SP3 vs 5.7% of referred youth SP1). Identification of trafficked patients increased from 1.3% of screen-positive youth to 11.3% (SP1 vs SP3; p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Routine screening for child sex trafficking can be implemented in the ED setting and increases the identification of at-risk youth.",2022,,CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT,125,,,WOS:000787891100013,10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105506,,#2859,Peterson 2022,,

Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n = 19) or comparison group (n = 19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed >= 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed >= 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (similar to 10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to >= 70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study.

Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 homeless young adults aged 18 to 30 years old, to explore how music modulated their addictive trajectory. A thematic and trajectory analysis were performed. Music most often constituted a tool used to control, reduce, or recover from problematic PS use, and sometimes led to the initiation of novel substances, increased consumption, and relapses. These benefits and harms varied according to specific individual and contextual factors. Almost half of the sample reported no link between music and PS use.

Methods: This study includes 143 sexually active YAEH (ages 18-27) who reported engaging in vaginal sex during the past three months: 67 ""unhoused"" (i.e., street-based, couch-surfers, or staying in emergency shelter), and 76 ""housed"" from SH programs. Multiple logistic regression examined the relationship of housing status and partner type with condom and contraceptive use. Results: Being a parent was associated with higher odds of contraceptive use regardless of housing status, while partner type (i.e., serious or casual partner) was differently associated with condom use by housing status.

Mothers were randomized to one of the three conditions: EBT (n = 80), Housing-only (HOU; n = 80), or Services as Usual (SAU; n = 80). Follow-up assessments were completed at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-baseline. The dual-trajectory latent class growth analyses identified five subgroups of co-occurring patterns: low-greatly improved housing paired with moderate-improved parenting stress, low-greatly improved housing paired with high-improved parenting stress, low-moderately improved housing paired with moderate-static parenting stress, low-worse housing paired with moderate-improved parenting stress, and low-worse housing paired with high-static parenting stress. Findings showed that EBT was more effective in improving housing stability and reducing parenting stress compared to HOU and SAU conditions, and further, HOU was more effective than SAU. Additionally, children whose mothers reported increased housing stability together with improved parenting stress had lower levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The findings provide support to the efficacy of EBT in increasing housing stability and reducing parenting stress. The observed improvements subsequently benefited children's behavioral outcomes.",2023,,FAMILY PROCESS,,,,WOS:001127024100001,10.1111/famp.12954,,#2869,Zhang 2023,,
Lack of efficacy in a randomised trial of a brief intervention to reduce drug use and increase drug treatment services utilisation among adult emergency department patients over a 12-month period,"Merchant, RC; Zhang, ZL; Zhang, ZH; Liu, T; Baird, JR","Objectives Assess the 12-month efficacy of a brief intervention (BI) on reducing drug use and increasing drug treatment services utilisation among adult emergency department (ED) patients.Methods This randomised, controlled trial enrolled 18-64-year-old ED patients needing a drug use intervention. Treatment arm participants received a tailored BI while control arm participants only completed the study questionnaires. Self-reported past 3-month drug use and engagement in drug treatment services were compared by study arm at 3-month intervals over 1 year. Multiple imputations were performed to overcome loss-to-follow-up.Results Of the 1030 participants, follow-up completion ranged 55%-64% over the four follow-ups. At 12 months, the two study arms were similar in regards to mean: (1) proportion reporting any drug use (treatment: 67.1% (61.6 to 72.6), control: 74.4% (69.4 to 79.4)); (2) drug use frequency on a five-point scale (treatment: 3.7 (3.3 to 4.2), control: 4.6 (4.0 to 5.2)); (3) total days of drug use (treatment: 28.3 (23.2 to 33.4), control: 33.4 (28.5 to 38.2)); (4) most number of times drugs used/day (treatment: 4.6 (3.6 to 5.5), control: 6.1 (4.8 to 7.3)) and (5) typical number of times drugs used/day (treatment: 3.3 (2.5 to 4.1), control: 5.1 (3.9 to 6.2)). Utilisation of drug treatment services also was similar by study arm. In multivariable regression analyses, patients who were homeless or had higher drug use at baseline continued to have greater drug use in follow-up.Conclusions Among adult ED patients requiring a drug use intervention, this BI did not decrease drug use or increase drug treatment services utilisation over a 12-month period more than the control condition.",2018,,EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL,35,5,282-+,WOS:000430831200002,10.1136/emermed-2016-206540,,#2870,Merchant 2018,,
Getting to the Root of the Problem: A Decision-Tree Analysis for Suicide Risk Among Young People Experiencing Homelessness,"Fulginiti, A; Segal, A; Wilson, J; Hill, C; Tambe, M; Castro, C; Rice, E","Objective: Although many suicide risk factors have been identified, there is limited guidance about their relative importance and the combinations of factors that heighten risk among young people experiencing homelessness (YEH). We sought to use decision-tree (DT) analyses to better understand and predict suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among YEH. Method: Using survey and social network methods, we gathered information about 940 YEH and their relationships. We then used a machine learning approach to construct classification and regression tree models to predict suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Results: Thirteen variables were important correlates in the DT models; this included prominent individual risk factors (e.g., trauma, depression), but more than half were social network factors (e.g., hard drug use). For suicidal ideation, the model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.79, with accuracy of 68%, sensitivity of 48%, and specificity of 73%. For suicide attempt, the model had an AUC value of 0.86, with accuracy of 71%, sensitivity of 68%, and specificity of 72%. Conclusions: Effective suicide prevention programming should target the syndemic that threatens YEH (i.e., co-occurrence of trauma, depression, substance use, and violence), including social norms in their environments. With refinement, our decision trees may be useful for suicide risk screening and guiding targeted intervention.",2022,,JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SOCIAL WORK AND RESEARCH,13,2,327-352,WOS:000805635000001,10.1086/715211,,#2871,Fulginiti 2022,,
Evaluation of a Tool to Identify Child Sex Trafficking Victims in Multiple Healthcare Settings,"Greenbaum, VJ; Livings, MS; Lai, BS; Edinburgh, L; Baikie, P; Grant, SR; Kondis, J; Petska, HW; Bowman, MJ; Legano, L; Kas-Osoka, O; Self-Brown, S","Purpose: Estimate the prevalence of child sex trafficking (CST) among patients seeking care in multiple healthcare settings; evaluate a short screening tool to identify victims in a healthcare setting.Methods: This cross-sectional observational study involved patients from 16 sites throughout the U.S.: five pediatric emergency departments, six child advocacy centers, and five teen clinics. Participants included English-speaking youth ages 11-17 years. For emergency department sites, inclusion criteria included a chief complaint of sexual violence. Data on several domains were gathered through self report questionnaires and examiner interview. Main outcomes included prevalence of CST among eligible youth; sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and positive/negative likelihood ratios for a CST screening tool.Results: Eight hundred and ten participants included 91 (11.52%) youth from emergency departments, 395 (48.8%) from child advocacy centers, and 324 (40.0%) from teen clinics. Overall prevalence of CST was 11.1%: 13.2% among emergency department patients, 6.3% among child advocacy center patients, and 16.4% among teen clinic patients, respectively. The screen had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio of 84.44% (75.28, 91.23), 57.50% (53.80, 61.11), and 1.99% (1.76, 2.25), respectively.Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significant rate of CST among patients presenting to emergency departments (for sexual violence complaints), child advocacy centers, and teen clinics. A six-item screen showed relatively good sensitivity and moderate specificity. Negative predictive value was high. Intervention for a ""positive"" screen may identify victims and help prevent high-risk youth from becoming victimized.

Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis.ResultsAmong 51 participants (mean age = 26.1, SD = 4.2; 59% male; 20% experiencing housing instability), more than half (59%, n = 30) rarely or never used mainstream video chat (e.g., Facetime). The majority (78%, n = 40) reported obstacles to attending appointments, with several (37%, n = 19) identifying two or more. Almost half (49%, n = 25) were very favorable towards telepsychiatry and a quarter (25%, n = 13) were somewhat favorable. Participants expressed several concerns about telepsychiatry, including loss of human contact and confidentiality.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is a first study on the perspectives of individuals with FEP about telepsychiatry. Despite experiencing obstacles to attending appointments and expressing receptivity towards telepsychiatry, participants did not have access to these services. It is important to provide education to clinicians on the potential of telepsychiatry to improve service access.

Method: We used data collected from 1,046 homeless youth (ages 13-24) in Los Angeles County, CA, between October 2011 and June 2013. We used classification tree analyses to rank predictors of service use in order of importance and to test linear and nonlinear relationships among selected variables. Results: Across service type (i.e., shelter, therapy, employment, or health services), the classification tree analyses highlighted race as a primary predictor of service use.

Experiences of Discrimination Among Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness: Relationship to Mental Health Outcomes,"Narendorf, SC; Palmer, A; Minott, K; Santa Maria, D; Bender, K; Shelton, J; Ferguson, K; Hsu, HT; Barman-Adhikari, A; Petering, R","Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) are at high risk for discrimination. Limited research has documented the extent of discrimination experiences and their relationship to mental health outcomes among this group. This study used data from YAEH who completed self-administered surveys across seven U.S. cities (N = 1,426) to examine the rates and correlates of discrimination experiences and their association with psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the relations between perceived discrimination and race, gender identity, sexual orientation, foster care history, criminal justice history, reasons for homelessness, and length of time homeless. Then, logistic regression was used to examine whether discrimination increased the odds of psychological distress and suicidal ideation, controlling for other factors. Three-fourths (75.8%) of the sample (n = 1,055) reported experiencing at least one of the five forms of everyday discrimination experiences at least a few times a year, with the most common reason attributed to their housing situation (46%). Sexual orientation, juvenile justice involvement, and having been homeless for 2 years or more were associated with increased odds of experiencing discrimination. Discrimination was a strong predictor of psychological distress but was significant only at the bivariate level for suicidal ideation. Study results suggest that experiences of discrimination are common among YAEH and that these experiences increase risk for psychological distress. Providers working with YAEH need to validate and acknowledge the impact of these experiences on mental health. And, communities need to work to reduce discrimination experiences by targeting stigma against YAEH.Public Policy Relevance Statement This study found that over three quarters of young adults experiencing homelessness reported discrimination experiences and that these were related to higher rates of psychological distress. Interventions that acknowledge these experiences and build resilience are needed to support YAEH paired with community interventions to reduce the public stigma of homelessness that contributes to these experiences and eliminate policies that criminalize homelesness.",2022,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY,92,1,58-67,WOS:000733078500001,10.1037/ort0000585,,#2880,Narendorf 2022,,
Barriers and opportunities to supporting youth of color and LGBTQ plus youth experiencing homelessness during COVID: A qualitative assessment,"Damian, AJ; Ponce, D; Gonzalez, M; Azevedo, B; Kokan, Z; Ortiz-Siberon, A","Purpose: Youth homelessness is a major public health issue that impacts millions of youth across the United States, with a disproportionate impact on LGBTQ + youth and youth of color. This study engaged adults who work at youth-serving organizations (YSO) in New Britain, Connecticut to better understand the perspectives and experiences of administrators and frontline workers serving youth experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 19 key informants over the age of 18 years old. Key informant interviews were guided by a semi-structured guide to understand three areas of interests from the perspective of youth-serving personnel: (1) identified needs of youth experiencing homelessness; (2) organizational and com-munity barriers to addressing identified needs, and (3) communal assets and needs to be better positioned to serve youth experiencing homelessness, with a particular emphasis on youth of color and LGBTQ + youth. Constant comparative method was subsequently applied to analyze qualitative findings. Results: Major themes that emerged from the key informant interviews included: homeless youth lacking access to needed mental health services and a trusted support network; youth-serving professionals not being adequately equipped to address the unique needs of LGBTQ + youth and youth of color experiencing homelessness, and; a need for a centralized referral system for connecting YSOs with each other. Conclusion: The key informant interviews were a valuable way to engage YSOs and better understand, from their perspective, the health and health-related social needs of youth, particularly youth of color and LGBTQ + youth, experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as potential policy and programmatic solutions for addressing these challenges.",2023,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,155,,,WOS:001165577100001,10.1016/j.childyouth.2023.107153,,#2881,Damian 2023,,
Cost-effective way to reduce stimulant-abuse among gay/bisexual men and transgender women: a randomized clinical trial with a cost comparison,"Zhang, SX; Shoptaw, S; Reback, CJ; Yadav, K; Nyamathi, AM","Objectives: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 422 homeless, stimulantusing gay/bisexual (G/B) men and 29 transgender women (n = 451) to assess two community-based interventions to reduce substance abuse and improve health: (a) a nurse case-managed program combined with contingency management (NCM thorn CM) versus (b) standard education plus contingency management (SE thorn CM). Study design: Hypotheses tested included: a) completion of hepatitis A/B vaccination series; b) reduction in stimulant use; and c) reduction in number of sexual partners.Methods: A deconstructive cost analysis approach was utilized to capture direct costs associated with the delivery of both interventions. Based on an analysis of activity logs and staff interviews, specific activities and the time required to complete each were analyzed as follows: a) NCM thorn CM only; b) SE thorn CM only; c) time to administer/record vaccines; and d) time to receive and record CM visits. Cost comparison of the interventions included only staffing costs and direct cash expenditures.Results: The study outcomes showed significant over time reductions in all measures of drug use and multiple sex partners, compared to baseline, although no significant between-group differences were detected. Cost analysis favored the simpler SE thorn CM intervention over the more labor-intensive NCM thorn CM approach. Because of the high levels of staffing required for the NCM relative to SE, costs associated with it were significantly higher.Conclusions: Findings suggest that while both intervention strategies were equally effective in achieving desired health outcomes, the brief SE thorn CM appeared less expensive to deliver.

Educational equity: A scoping review of the state of literature exploring educational outcomes and correlates for children experiencing homelessness,"Parrott, KA; Huslage, M; Cronley, C","Families with children account for 30% of the national homeless population. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, passed in 1987 and reauthorized in 2015, mandates educational access to children experiencing homelessness across the United States. Utilizing PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a scoping review of research articles from 1987 to 2020 was conducted to the state of published peer-reviewed literature investigating the relationship between educational outcomes and correlates for children experiencing homelessness. Thirty-five articles were identified, refined from a total of 1,069 articles located across five databases. There was consensus among the articles that homelessness negatively affects children's educational outcomes. Children who are low-income have similar outcomes in achievement tests when compared to those experiencing homelessness, but the groups differ in graduation rates, classroom engagement, repeated grade levels, and truancy levels. Moreover, Black, Indigenous, and Students of Color (BISOC) are over-represented in the studies compared to the general population. Societal racism may result in higher rates of BISOC experiencing homelessness and negative educational outcomes. Thus, educational equity for students experiencing homelessness requires systemic support. Social justice initiatives for families experiencing homelessness should involve multi-disciplinary task forces to provide students with resources to overcome obstacles such as transportation, social stigma, and trauma. Interventions to assist this population academically need to start early in the children's ac-ademic career and should target low-income housed students as well, recognizing the within-group diversity of needs of both groups.",2022,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,143,,,WOS:000933948300007,10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106673,,#2883,Parrott 2022,,

We also investigated potential differences across demographic subgroups. Methods: Young adults (N = 3717, Mage = 20.1, 28% female, 7.3% sexual/gender minority, and 37% non-Hispanic White) receiving substance use treatment in the U.S. completed assessments at intake, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-intake. Latent growth curve models with structured residuals (LGC-SR) were used to examine cross-lagged associations between homeless days and frequency of substance use and associated problems.

Results: Overall, days spent homeless (mu(slope )= -0.19, p = 0.046) and substance use frequency (mu(slope1 )= -6.19, p < 0.001) significantly decreased during treatment, with no significant cross-lagged associations between homeless days and substance use frequency. However, results differed by race and ethnicity. For non-Hispanic White young adults, greater substance use at treatment entry was associated with steeper declines in homeless days between-persons (phi(standardized) = -0.14, p = 0.04).

Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors.MethodsThirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n =19) or comparison group (n=19). The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Qualitative and quantitative post-intervention, in-person interviews were used in addition to process documentation of study methods.ResultsOur results found that the study design and interventions showed promise for being acceptable to economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. The largely positive endorsement suggested that factors contributing to acceptability included perceived economic potential, sexual health education, convenience, incentives, and encouraging, personalized feedback to participants. Barriers to acceptability for some participants included low cell phone connectivity, perceived payment delays, small cohort size, and disappointment with one's randomization assignment to comparison group. Use of peer referral, network, or wait-list designs, in addition to online options may enhance acceptability in a future definitive trial.

Are social supports always protective? A seven-city study on heavy drinking among sexual and gender minority young adults experiencing homelessness,"Armstrong, BN; Barman-Adhikari, A; Shelton, J; Hsu, HT; Petering, R; Bender, K; Ferguson, KM; Maria, DS; Narendorf, SC","Purpose: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults are disproportionately impacted by homelessness and heavy drinking (i.e., having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours). Social support, in general, is protective in reducing individuals' risk of heavy drinking. However, whether and how support from different sources may have different implications on heavy drinking among SGM young adults experiencing homelessness (SGM-YAEH) remains unclear. Informed by the risk amplification and abatement model (RAAM), this study examined the associations between support sources and heavy drinking among SGM-YAEH. Methods: A purposive sample of SGM-YAEH (N=425) recruited in homeless service agencies from seven major cities in the U.S. completed a self-administered computer-assisted anonymous survey. This survey covered heavy drinking behaviors and social network properties. Logistic regression models were conducted to identify social support sources associated with SGM-YAEH's heavy drinking. Results: Over 40 % of SGM-YAEH were involved in heavy drinking in the past 30 days. Receiving support from street-based peers (OR=1.9; 95% CI=1.1, 3.2) and home-based peers (OR=1.7; 95% CI=1.0, 2.8) were each positively associated with SGMYAEH heavy drinking risks. Conclusion: This study was not able to identify the protective role social supports may play in reducing SGMYAEH's heavy drinking. Furthermore, receiving support from network members was correlated with elevated heavy drinking risks among this population. As heavy drinking prevention programs develop interventions: they should use affirming and trauma approaches to promote protective social ties, as research points to its association in reducing alcohol use disparities among SGM-YAEH.",2024,,DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE,262,,,WOS:001286338100001,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2024.111404,,#2889,Armstrong 2024,,
Predicting Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration Among Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness in Seven US Cities Using Interpretable Machine Learning,"Um, MY; Manikonda, L; Eapen, DJ; Ferguson, KM; Maria, DMS; Narendorf, SC; Petering, R; Barman-Adhikari, A; Hsu, HT","Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) are at higher risk for intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization than their housed peers. This is often due to their increased vulnerability to abuse and victimization before and during homelessness, which can result in a cycle of violence in which YAEH also perpetrates IPV. Identifying and addressing factors contributing to IPV perpetration at an early stage can reduce the risk of IPV. Yet to date, research examining YAEH's IPV perpetration is scarce and has largely employed conventional statistical approaches that are limited in modeling this complex phenomenon. To address these gaps, this study used an interpretable machine learning approach to answer the research question: What are the most salient predictors of IPV perpetration among a large sample of YAEH in seven U.S. cities? Participants (N = 1,426) on average were 21 years old (SD = 2.09) and were largely cisgender males (59%) and racially/ethnically diverse (81% were from historically excluded racial/ethnic groups; i.e., African American, Latino/a, American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander, and mixed race/ethnicity). Over one-quarter (26%) reported IPV victimization, and 20% reported IPV perpetration while homeless. Experiencing IPV victimization while homeless was the most important factor in predicting IPV perpetration. An additional 11 predictors (e.g., faced frequent discrimination) were positively associated with IPV perpetration, whereas 8 predictors (e.g., reported higher scores of mindfulness) were negatively associated. These findings underscore the importance of developing and implementing effective interventions with YAEH that can prevent IPV, particularly those that recognize the positive association between victimization and perpetration experiences.",2024,,JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE,,,,WOS:001276801000001,10.1177/08862605241263588,,#2893,Um 2024,,

Our contribution seeks to update and complete the survey efforts of Patrick (2014), which was an exhaustive review of mainly English Canadian scientific literature on the subject, produced between 1988 and 2012. Our work brings together recent contributions in French and English concerning Aboriginal homelessness and seeks to improve our knowledge of family factors that influence homelessness. This review of the literature shows that certain realities of Aboriginal homelessness are better documented than others; research in some areas has looked further into the question. While there are numerous contributions in the field of public health, they are much more limited in the areas of psychology and social work, where intervention practices are little document, if at all. This situation says a great deal about the systematic exclusion of Aboriginal people, who participate very little in the production of knowledge that directly concerns them.",2018,,CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE,59,1,100-106,WOS:000423875900010,10.1037/cap0000106,,#2894,Grenier 2018,,
Adverse childhood experiences and related outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Liu, M; Luong, L; Lachaud, J; Edafati, H; Reeves, A; Hwang, SW","Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are strong risk factors for homelessness and poor health and functioning. We aimed to evaluate the lifetime prevalence of ACEs and their associations with health-related and functioning-related outcomes among homeless adults.Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched from database inception to Nov 11, 2020, for original and peer-reviewed studies in English that documented lifetime prevalence of ACEs or associations between ACEs and health-related or functioning-related outcomes. We selected studies if they included a definable group of homeless adults and measured at least four ACE categories. We calculated pooled estimates of lifetime prevalence of one or more ACEs and four or more ACEs with random-effects models. We used the leave-one-out method in sensitivity analyses and studied meta-regressions to explore potential moderators of ACE prevalence. We also did a narrative summary of associations between ACEs and health-related and functioning-related outcomes, as there were too few studies on each outcome for quantitative meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020218741.Findings We identified 2129 studies through systematic search, of which 29 studies (16 942 individuals) were included in the systematic review, 20 studies (10 034 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis for one or more ACEs, and 15 studies (5693 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis for four or more ACEs. Studies included samples of adults experiencing homelessness in the USA, Canada, and the UK; participants in the included studies were predominantly male (65.2%) and mean ages ranged between 18.3 and 58.1 years, but many studies did not report race, ethnicity, and sexual and gender minority data. Lifetime prevalence of one or more ACEs among homeless adults was 89.8% (95% CI 83.7-93.7) and the lifetime prevalence of four or more ACEs was 53.9% (45.9-61.7). Considerable heterogeneity was identified in both meta-analyses (I-2>95%). Of the potential moderators analysed, the ACE measurement tool significantly moderated the estimated lifetime prevalence of one or more ACEs and four or more ACEs, and age also significantly moderated the estimated lifetime prevalence of four or more ACEs. In the narrative synthesis, ACEs were consistently positively associated with high suicidality (two studies), suicide attempt (three studies), major depressive disorder (two studies), substance misuse (two studies), and adult victimisation (two studies).Interpretation The lifetime prevalence of ACEs is substantially higher among homeless adults than among the general population, and ACE exposure might be associated with prevalence of mental illness, substance misuse, and victimisation. Policy efforts and evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to prevent ACEs and address associated poor outcomes among this population. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral psychodrama group therapy (CBPGT) on inadequate guardian male adolescents? creativity and critical thinking,"Fallahi, N; Tashk, A; Towhidi, A","Adolescents specifically those who have inadequate guardians need to be taught to be creative and be critical thinkers in order to solve their problems or at least adapt themselves with their guardians or the miserable circumstances. In this respect, the present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral psychodrama group therapy (CBPGT) on the creativity and critical thinking of male adolescents with inadequate guardians. The participants were 30 male adolescents who were referred by a nursery home. Using convenient sampling method, the adolescents were recruited and using simple random method they were divided into the inter-vention and control groups (each 15 members). The participants in the intervention attended 10 two-hour CBPGT sessions held by a psychotherapist while the control group members did not receive any intervention. The participants in both groups completed Schaefer...s creativity atti-tude survey (CAS) and Ricketts... critical thinking disposition assessment (CTDA) before the intervention as the pretest and after the intervention as the posttests. The results of the analysis of multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) show that CBPGT has a significant effect on improving both creativity and critical thinking of male adolescents with inadequate guardians. It is concluded that the CBPGT is a useful means to enhance creativity and critical thinking. The insights from this study can be used for implementing interventions for students, vulnerable groups such as children and adolescents living in welfare centers, and even those in correctional and rehabilitation centers.",2023,,THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY,47,,,WOS:000975633700001,10.1016/j.tsc.2022.101171,,#2896,Fallahi 2023,,
Recovery Education for Adults Transitioning From Homelessness: A Longitudinal Outcome Evaluation,"Durbin, A; Nisenbaum, R; Wang, R; Hwang, SW; Kozloff, N; Stergiopoulos, V","Objective: Grounded in principles of adult education, Recovery Education Centres (RECs) hold promise in promoting recovery for adults with mental health challenges, but research on recovery outcomes for hard-to-reach populations participating in RECs is scant. This quasi-experimental study compares 12-month recovery outcomes of adults with histories of homelessness and mental health challenges enrolled in a REC, to those of participants of other community services for this population.Methods: This pre-post quasi-experimental study compared participants enrolled in a REC for people with histories of homelessness and mental health challenges (n = 92) to an age-and-gender frequency matched control group participating in usual services (n = 92) for this population in Toronto, Ontario. Changes from program enrollment to 12 months in personal empowerment (primary outcome), disease specific quality of life, recovery, health status, health related quality of life, and mastery were assessed. Post-hoc analyses compared subgroups with 1-13 h (n = 37) and 14+ h (n = 37) of REC participation during the study period to the control group. Linear mixed models estimated mean changes and differences in mean changes and 95% confidence intervals.Results: Mean change in perceived empowerment from program enrollment to 12 months in the intervention group [0.10 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.15)] was not significantly different from the control group [0.05 (-0.01, 0.11)], mean difference, 0.05 [(-0.03, 0.13), P = 0.25]. In the post-hoc analysis, the mean change in perceived empowerment for the intervention subgroup with 14+ h of REC participation [0.18 (0.10, 0.26)] was significantly different than in the control group [0.05 (-0.01, 0.11)] mean difference, 0.13 [(0.03, 0.23), P < 0.01]. Mean change in mastery was also significantly different for the intervention subgroup with 14+ h of REC participation [2.03 (1.04, 3.02)] vs. controls [0.60 (-0.15, 1.35)], mean difference, 1.43 [(0.19, 2.66), P = 0.02].

The objective of this study is to comprehensively describe the mental, physical, and social health profile of young adults living in SROs.Methods This study reports baseline data from young adults aged 18-29 years, as part of a prospective cohort study of adults living in SROs in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Baseline and follow-up data were collected from 101 young adults (median follow-up period 1.9 years [IQR 1.0-3.1]). The comprehensive assessment included laboratory tests, neuroimaging, and clinician-and patient-reported measures of mental, physical, and social health and functioning.Results Three youth died during the preliminary follow-up period, translating into a higher than average mortality rate (18.6, 95% CI 6.0, 57.2) compared to age-and sex-matched Canadians. High prevalence of interactions with the health, social, and justice systems was reported. Participants were living with median two co-occurring illnesses, including mental, neurological, and infectious diseases. Greater number of multimorbid illnesses was associated with poorer real-world functioning (rho = -0.373, p < 0.001). All participants reported lifetime alcohol and cannabis use, with pervasive use of stimulants and opioids.Conclusion This study reports high mortality rates, multimorbid illnesses, poor functioning, poverty, and ongoing unmet mental health needs among young adults living in SROs.

Suicidal behaviors among intravenous drug users: a meta-analysis,"Armoon, B; Fleury, MJ; Bayani, A; Mohammadi, R; Ahounbar, E; Griffiths, MD","Background Suicidal behaviors including ideations and attempts may ultimately lead to suicide especially among intravenous drug users (IVDUs). The present study assessed the prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, risky behaviors, mental health conditions, and type of drug use associated with suicidal behaviors among IVDUs. Methods Studies in English published from January 1, 1995 to February 1, 2022 were searched on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science to identify papers on variables associated with suicidal behaviors (ideation and attempts) among IVDUs. Results Out of 10,795 papers, 21 studies met the eligibility criteria. Among IVDUs, the findings indicated a past-year pooled prevalence rate of 35% for suicide ideations (95% CI, 22%-48%) and 25% for suicide attempts (95% CI, 13%-36%). Generally, suicide ideations were associated with being homeless, having a previous history of physical and sexual abuse, and depression. Suicide attempts were associated with being female, having a previous history of physical and sexual abuse, having depression or other mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety, stress, and serious mental health disorders), and having cocaine, methamphetamine, sedative-hypnotic, and polysubstance use disorders. Conclusions Integrated treatment and assertive community treatment approaches may be promoted to prevent suicidal behaviors.

There is limited research on suburban and rural homelessness. This study reports on a mixed-methods study guided by the Social Ecological Model to understand the mental health and service needs among 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness across York Region, a suburban and semi-rural region in Ontario, Canada. In-depth one-on-one interviews and surveys were utilized to explore mental health and experiences of homelessness. This study found that youth participants reported an array of mental health difficulties and challenges including depression, suicidality, and substance use. Additionally, the study found that participants experienced family rejection, stigma, discrimination, inadequate services and hidden homelessness, which contributed to their poor mental health.

'It's Not Just About a Rainbow Lanyard': How Structural Cisnormativity Undermines the Enactment of Anti-Discrimination Legislation in the Welsh Homelessness Service,"England, E","Trans people(1) - those whose gender identity does not match that assigned to them at birth - are at considerably elevated risk of homelessness, reflecting their marginalized legal, bureaucratic and socio-economic status(2). Recent substantial international expansion to the medico-legal rights afforded them operates in tension with cisnormative welfare structures. Based upon a Critical Discourse Analysis of interviews with 35 trans people with experience of homeless in Wales, UK, alongside 12 workers in the system, I argue that anti-discrimination legislation is insufficient in its current form to prevent discrimination against trans people. I suggest that, without addressing deeper structural cisnormativity, service provision for trans people experiencing homelessness and other forms of social marginalisation will remain inadequate. This argument rests upon the following findings. (1) Failing to consider exclusion at a structural level leads to system-gaps and misunderstandings, producing poor service experiences. (2) The specific needs of trans applicants are under considered in system planning, reducing scope for meaningful homelessness interventions. (3) An equalities approach can produce a reductive and potentially pathologizing focus upon trans identity, diverting from specific individual needs. I conclude that provision of inclusive services necessitates consideration of the impact of deep cisnormative assumptions in service design and delivery, and their resultant exclusion of trans people.",2024,,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY,53,2,366-385,WOS:000774562000001,10.1017/S0047279422000289,,#2901,England 2024,,

Using a qualitative approach, this study aimed to identify homelessness agency use profiles among LGBTQ + youth. Individual interviews were conducted with seventeen LGBTQ + youths aged 17 to 25 years experiencing homelessness. Three profiles were identified: 1) resigning oneself to using homelessness agencies to meet basic needs and assure one's survival despite potential heteronormative and cisnormative victimization; 2) resisting homelessness agencies to protect oneself from heteronormative and cisnormative victimization; and 3) having a positive experience marked by feelings of acceptance and recognition within homelessness agencies.

Participants included 163 runaway and 581 nonrunaway adolescents who completed a self-report survey. Several dimensions of time perspective were measured including positive and negatives attitudes, orientations, and perceived relationships regarding the past, the present, and the future. Psychological outcomes included optimism, self-esteem, and hope; risky behavior was assessed with a composite scale. Results indicated that runaway adolescents reported less positive and more negative attitudes toward time and perceived time periods as less related than nonrunaways, even after controlling for differences in maternal education and academic achievement.

A Scoping Review of the Experiences and Outcomes of Stigma and Discrimination towards Persons Experiencing Homelessness,"Canham, SL; Weldrick, R; Erisman, M; McNamara, A; Rose, JN; Siantz, E; Casucci, T; McFarland, MM","A pervasive barrier to preventing, reducing, and ending homelessness is the stigmatization of and discrimination towards persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), termed ""homeism."" To date, there has been no systematic review of the experiences and outcomes of stigmatization and discrimination among PEH or interventions to reduce this discrimination. To fill this gap in the literature, we conducted a scoping review to identify the ways in which PEH have been stigmatized and discriminated against, the results of these experiences, and interventions that have been used to reduce stigma and discrimination. We reviewed results from 12 databases with no date restrictions; 205 studies met our inclusion criteria. Thematic data analyses resulted in the identification of 12 categories. Using community consultation, the scoping review themes were reviewed and validated with 25 PEH or service providers in the homelessness sector and their feedback integrated into our results. Thematic categories included discrimination and stigmatization in healthcare, social services, workplaces and employment, and public spaces by the general public; discrimination and stigmatization from landlords, police and security guards, informal social networks, and by PEH toward PEH; discrimination and stigmatization linked to intersectional domains; PEH feelings about discrimination and stigmatization; outcomes of discrimination and stigmatization for PEH; and interventions to reduce stigma, discrimination, and prejudice towards PEH.

More specifically, the aim of this study was to investigate reports from adolescents with mental illness regarding: (1) factors they perceive influence their trust, (2) factors statistically associated with trust, and (3) interventions that support trust. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Articles were identified through database and hand searches, with 89 of the 2010 identified articles included. Frequency counts and content analysis revealed several factors which fostered trust e.g., worker reliability. Trust was associated with protective factors such as quality of communication, and negatively with mental illness. Thirteen articles reported on trust outcomes of interventions, with most reporting positive outcomes.

Characteristics of Emergency Department Visits by Homeless Young Adults in the US,"Nam, E; Palmer, AN; Patel, M","Purpose: Homeless young adults often seek health care at emergency departments (EDs) after they are no longer able to ignore a pressing health problem. However, a dearth of literature ex-amines homeless young adults' ED visits. This study aimed to increase understanding of ED visits among homeless young adults within the U.S.Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the 2011-2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The sample for this study included all ED visits made by homeless and housed young adults aged 18-29 years (unweighted N = 25,068).Results: ED visits by homeless young adults were distinguished in terms of gender, region, payment sources, and triage level. Furthermore, ED visits made by homeless young adults were more likely related to mental health and suicide. Homeless young adults' ED visits were characterized by a longer average length of stay and were less likely to be referred to a physician or clinic for follow-up, given medication, or have a procedure performed in the ED.Conclusions: This study highlighted differences in ED utilization for homeless young adults. The findings of this study suggest a need to further examine the characteristics of ED services received by homeless young adults to better understand differences in ED service receipt related to housing status. This knowledge can inform efforts to reduce costs through improving access to housing and outpatient mental health care and reducing stigma among health care professionals to ensure continuity of care.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with homeless LGBTQI+ youth in Dublin and other Irish cities and with policy makers, homeless service providers and advocacy group representatives, this article reflects on the causes and implications of this invisibility. As its title suggests, the article identifies four interrelated causes of the invisibility - the unreal, unsheltered, unseen and unrecorded nature of LGBTQI+ youth homelessness. The article examines how these factors individually and collectively perpetuate the invisibility of LGBTQI+ homeless youth, impede their access to services for homeless people and reduce the likelihood that homeless services will be tailored to meet their needs and enable them to successfully exit homelessness.",2021,,CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY,41,3,468-490,WOS:000578773700001,10.1177/0261018320953328,,#2907,Norris 2021,,
"""I've seen my friend get chopped"": The Influence of Peer Networks on Exposure to Violence Among Homeless Young Adults","Heerde, JA; Pallotta-Chiarolli, M","Homeless young adults report being exposed to substantial violence and victimization. This often arises through street culture and norms associated with subcultures of violent behavior. In this exploratory study, we applied a decolonizing lens to conduct semi-structured interviews with 18 young adults experiencing homelessness in Victoria, Australia. In this study, we provide a contemporary description of peer relationships among homeless young adults. We examine how these relationships influence exposure to violence, and how young adults perceive and respond to injuries sustained by their peers because of exposure to violence. Findings showed bonds and relationships between homeless young adults appear to imitate the rapport and functions of sibling-kinship that typically exist in supportive family environments. Despite the care and protection provided within close peer relationships, these relationships may also contribute to exposure to violence by way of young adults witnessing violence perpetration and incidences of peers being physically victimized. There is an important duality between the perceived normalization of witnessing peers' experiences of violence and young adults' self-reflexive disclosure of vulnerability and helplessness in witnessing these incidents. Study findings have important research and practice implications for recognizing the influence and importance of peer relationships in the delivery of homelessness support programs.",2021,,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH,36,3,247-273,WOS:000527977700001,10.1177/0743558420913479,,#2908,Heerde 2021,,

We sought to establish the prevalence of non-dating sexual violence, sexual dating violence, and physical dating violence victimization among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate whether experiences of disruption and adversity placed adolescents at greater risk for these forms of interpersonal violence. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Adolescent Behavior and Experiences Survey, collected January to June 2021 from a nationally representative sample of U.S. high school students (N = 7,705). Exposures included abuse by a parent; economic, housing, and food and nutrition insecurity; interpersonal connectedness; and personal well-being. Among female students, 8.0% experienced non-dating sexual violence; 12.5% experienced sexual dating violence; and 7.7% experienced physical dating violence. Among male students, 2.2% experienced non-dating sexual violence; 2.4% experienced sexual dating violence; and 4.9% experienced physical dating violence. Among female students, both emotional and physical abuse by a parent was related to non-dating sexual violence, emotional abuse was related to sexual dating violence, and physical abuse was related to physical dating violence. Among males, emotional abuse by a parent was related to physical dating violence and physical abuse by a parent was related to sexual dating violence. Hunger was associated with sexual and physical dating violence among female students and homeless was associated with physical dating violence among male students. Although there were differences by sex, abuse by a parent, hunger, and homelessness created precarity that may have increased the likelihood that adolescents would be exposed to risky peer or dating relationships.

Behavioral Health and Adult Milestones in Young Adults With Perinatal HIV Infection or Exposure,"Abrams, EJ; Mellins, CA; Bucek, A; Dolezal, C; Raymond, J; Wiznia, A; Jurgrau, A; Bamji, M; Leu, CS; Ng, YKW","BACKGROUND: Young adults living with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIVYAs) are at risk for poor biomedical and behavioral health outcomes. Few studies offer a comprehensive overview of the functioning of this population in young adulthood and the role of HIV.METHODS: Data come from the Child and Adolescent Self-Awareness and Health Study, a longitudinal behavioral health cohort study of PHIVYAs and perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected young adults (PHEUYAs) who are compared on psychiatric and neurocognitive functioning, sexual and substance use behaviors, health and reproductive outcomes, and young adult milestones.RESULTS: Overall, 27% of participants met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, including mood (11%), anxiety (22%), and substance use (28%), with no HIV status differences. PHIVYAs performed worse on 2 neurocognitive tests. There were no HIV status differences in condomless sex (41%) or pregnancies (41% women; 38% men). Both groups exhibited similar adult milestones: 67% graduated high school or an equivalent, 19% were in college, and 42% were employed. However, 38% were neither in school or working, 12% reported incarceration, and 16% were ever homeless. Among PHIVYAs, 36% were viremic (> 200 copies per mL), and 15% were severely immunocompromised (CD4(+) cell count < 100 cells per mm(3)).CONCLUSIONS: Many PHIVYAs achieve adult milestones related to school, employment, sexual relationships, and starting families.

Schizophrenia: A Review of Social Risk Factors That Affect Women,"González-Rodríguez, A; Natividad, M; Seeman, MV; Paolini, JP; Balagué, A; Román, E; Izquierdo, E; Pérez, A; Vallet, A; Salvador, M; Monreal, JA","Social risk factors are long-term or repeated environmental exposures in childhood and youth that change the brain and may, via epigenetic effects, change gene expression. They thus have the power to initiate or aggravate mental disorders. Because these effects can be mediated via hormonal or immune/inflammatory pathways that differ between men and women, their influence is often sex-specific. The goal of this narrative review is to explore the literature on social risk factors as they affect women with schizophrenia. We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases from 2000 to May 2023 using terms referring to the various social determinants of health in conjunction with ""women"" and with ""schizophrenia"".

Substance Use Treatment Completion Among Unhoused Young Adults: A Predictive Modeling Approach,"Dell, NA; Long, CRN; Salas-Wright, CP; Vaughn, MG; Szlyk, HS; Cavazos-Rehg, P","Background: Unhoused young adults aged 18-24 years are at increased risk of substance misuse relative to the general population and experience unique barriers to engaging in treatment. This study evaluates predictors of treatment completion for unhoused young adults receiving substance use treatment. Methods: Predictive models were generated on data from the 2020 Treatment Episode Data Set-Discharges. The sample included treatment discharges involving unhoused adults aged 18-24 years (N = 12,273). Model performance was assessed by inspecting several evaluative metrics. Results: Overall, each model performed relatively well (AUC: 0.7234-0.7753). Classification models trained on balanced data predicted a higher proportion of treatment completers. Models trained on balanced data also achieved higher balanced accuracy and F1 scores relative to models trained on imbalanced data.

The Cost of Early Independence: Unmet Material Needs Among College Students With Homelessness or Foster Care Histories,"Skobba, K; Moorman, D; Meyers, D","Qualitative interview data were used to explore the experiences of college students with foster care or homelessness experiences. Participants, with an average age of 21 years, included 18 female and nine male students with a history of homelessness or foster care enrolled in several independent 4-year colleges in one Southeastern state. Participants were recruited through a flyer that was distributed via an email message to individuals and organizations who worked with prospective participants. The qualitative data were collected over the course of an academic year from several in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interviews were analyzed using a directed content analysis approach to identify key themes: getting by on their own, meeting material needs requires agency, and the Catch-22 of managing academic and material needs. Findings suggest that many of the students in the study experienced a fragile and seemingly unsustainable balance between meeting material needs and academic demands. The current financial aid model, which relies on significant contributions from parents, was insufficient for most students in the study. Results support the need for interventions that improve the ability of students with foster care and homelessness histories to manage their material and academic needs as college students.",2022,,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH,37,5,691-713,WOS:000652888300001,10.1177/07435584211014831,,#2920,Skobba 2022,,
Knowledge of Alternative Tobacco Products in Unaccompanied Homeless Youth,"Shadel, WG; Tucker, JS; Abbott, MM","Objectives: In this study, we examined perceptions of factors that influence use and non-use of alternative tobacco products (ATPs) among unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness. Methods: We conducted focus groups with 30 homeless 18-24 year-olds (80% men, 50% Hispanic, 30% black, 17% white, 20% multi-racial/other) recruited from drop-in centers in Los Angeles. Discussion focused on several ATPs (hookah, electronic cigarettes/vaping devices, cigarillos/little cigars, smokeless tobacco, snus, natural cigarettes, clove cigarettes), soliciting participants' experiences using each ATP and motivations for using or not using each ATP. Results: Focus group transcripts were subjected to a rigorous coding procedure and 8 themes relating to the reasons that participants may or may not use ATPs emerged. Each ATP was associated with distinctive characteristics that motivated use and non-use. For example, hookah use was viewed positively with positive sensory and social features dominating the discussion, whereas electronic cigarettes were viewed largely negatively (ie, that they were expensive and harmful to health). Homelessness characterized participants' responses to the extent that cost was a factor in their choice of ATP. Conclusions: These data provide important, first-look insights into factors that may influence the use and non-use of ATPs among unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness.",2019,,TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE,5,1,65-75,WOS:000453903900006,10.18001/TRS.5.1.6,,#2921,Shadel 2019,,
Predictors for runaway behavior in adolescents in South Korea: national data from a comprehensive survey of adolescents,"Kim, HR; Moon, SH","Background: Runaway behavior is reported to impede the growth, mental health development, and social adjustment of adolescents. Exposure to harmful media causes problematic behaviors in adolescents, sometimes inducing them to run away from home.Methods: This study examined the factors influencing adolescents' runaway behavior. Utilizing the data of 11,354 adolescents from the Survey of Media Usage and Harmful Environment among Adolescents, a hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted using the SPSS 24.0 program.Results: The significant predictors of runaway behavior were the grade of the adolescent, deviant behaviors (drinking, smoking), autonomous control ability, relationship with family, and harmful media (p < 0.001). This regression model explained 13.1% of the variance in runaway behavior. A significant outcome of this study is that harmful media was identified as one of the factors affecting adolescents' runaway behavior. Adjusted OR and 95% CI of harmful media was 1.23 (1.10-1.38).Conclusion: This study showed that individual, family, social factors, and harmful media influence adolescents' runaway behavior.

Sexual Health Communication Among Young Black Women and Their Social Network Members,"Craddock, JB","Objective: Young Black women (YBW) are at high risk of HIV infection. Although sexual health communication in social networks has been shown to help prevent HIV among high-risk populations, sexual health communication between YBW and their social network members (SNMs) has been insufficiently studied. Method: Egocentric social-network-level and individual-level data were collected from 78 YBW ages 18-25 to examine their sexual health communication. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models assessed the association among individual sexual risk behaviors, SNM characteristics, and sexual health communication. Results: Participants nominated an average of 14 SNMs (N = 1,068). Friends were most frequently nominated (55%). YBW communicated to 55% of their SNMs about sex, to 32% regarding condom use, and to 21% regarding HIV testing. If SNMs provided emotional support, YBW were 4 times more likely to talk with them about sex and HIV testing and 2 times more likely to talk about condom use. Conclusions: These results indicate that before developing or adopting HIV interventions geared toward YBW, we need to assess how and with whom YBW are communicating about sexual health to better inform those interventions.",2020,,JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SOCIAL WORK AND RESEARCH,11,4,569-589,WOS:000598395900003,10.1086/711701,,#2923,Craddock 2020,,
Prevalence and correlates of HIV infection among people who use drugs in Cambodia: a cross-sectional survey using respondent driven sampling method,"Tuot, S; Mburu, G; Mun, P; Chhoun, P; Chann, N; Prem, K; Yi, SY","BackgroundMost of studies on the relationship between drug use and HIV have focused largely on people who inject drugs. Non-injecting drug use is much more common than injecting drug use, and although it can also predispose people to HIV infection, it is not widely explored. We therefore conducted this study to explore the prevalence of HIV and identify risk factors for HIV infection among people who use non-injecting drugs (PWUD) in Cambodia.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017. The Respondent Driven Sampling method was used to recruit the study participants who were interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for HIV and syphilis testing. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors associated with HIV infection.ResultsIn total, 1367 PWUD were included in this study, whose mean age was 28.0 (SD=7.7) years. The majority (95.1%) of the participants used methamphetamine. The prevalence of HIV was 5.7, and 35.2% of the identified HIV-positive PWUD were not aware of their status prior to the survey. After adjustment for other covariates, HIV infection remained significantly associated with being in the age group of 35 (AOR=2.34, 95% CI=1.04-6.11), having lower level of formal education of 6 years (AOR=2.26, 95% CI=1.04-5.15), living on the streets (AOR=2.82, 95% CI=1.10-7.23), perception that their HIV risk was higher as compared to that of the general population (AOR=3.18, 95% CI=1.27-8.62), having used injecting drugs in lifetime (AOR=3.8, 95% CI=1.36-4.56), and having cuts or sores around the genital area in the past 12months (AOR=3.42, 95% CI=1.09-6.33).ConclusionsThe prevalence of HIV among PWUD in this study was more than 10 times higher than the prevalence in the general adult population. The findings reveal a higher vulnerability to HIV infection among specific sub-populations of PWUD, such as those who are homeless, who may benefit from tailored interventions that respond to their specific needs. To enhance HIV case finding, stratification of PWUD to facilitate HIV risk profiling based on socio-economic profiles and drug injection history is recommended.",2019,,BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES,19,,,WOS:000471327300004,10.1186/s12879-019-4154-5,,#2924,Tuot 2019,,
LGBTQ plus Young Adults on the Street and on Campus: Identity as a Product of Social Context,"Schmitz, RM; Tyler, KA","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) young adults face unique identity-related experiences based on their immersion in distinctive social contexts. The predominant framework of performing separate analyses on samples of LGBTQ+ young people by their primary social status obfuscates more holistic understandings of the role of social context. Using 46 in-depth interviews with LGBTQ+ college students and LGBTQ+ homeless young adults, we ask: How are LGBTQ+ young adults' capacities for doing their gender and sexual identities shaped by their distinctive social contexts? In developing their identities, both groups of LGBTQ+ young adults navigated their social environments to seek out resources and support. Most college students described their educational contexts as conducive to helping them develop their identities, or undo rigid norms of gender and sexuality. Homeless young adults' social environments, meanwhile, imposed complex barriers to self-expression that reinforced more normative expectations of doing gender and sexual identities.",2018,,JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY,65,2,197-223,WOS:000419331200005,10.1080/00918369.2017.1314162,,#2928,Schmitz 2018,,

Where substance use may create health risks, understanding the contribution of social networks to substance use may be valuable for the design and implementation of harm reduction or other interventions. We examined the social support network of people living in precarious housing in a socially marginalized neighborhood of Vancouver, and analysed associations between social network structure, personal substance use, and supporters' substance use.MethodsAn ongoing, longitudinal study recruited 246 participants from four single room occupancy hotels, with 201 providing social network information aligned with a 6-month observation period. Use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine (crack and powder), methamphetamine, and heroin was recorded at monthly visits. Ego- and graph-level measures were calculated; the dispersion and prevalence of substances in the network was described. Logistic mixed effects models were used to estimate the association between ego substance use and peer substance use. Permutation analysis was done to test for randomness of substance use dispersion on the social network.ResultsThe network topology corresponded to residence (Hotel) with two clusters differing in demographic characteristics (Cluster 1 -Hotel A: 94% of members, Cluster 2 -Hotel B: 95% of members). Dispersion of substance use across the network demonstrated differences according to network topology and specific substance. Methamphetamine use (overall 12%) was almost entirely limited to Cluster 1, and absent from Cluster 2. Different patterns were observed for other substances. Overall, ego substance use did not differ over the six-month period of observation. Ego heroin, cannabis, or crack cocaine use was associated with alter use of the same substances. Ego methamphetamine, powder cocaine, or alcohol use was not associated with alter use, with the exception for methamphetamine in a densely using part of the network. For alters using multiple substances, cannabis use was associated with lower ego heroin use, and lower ego crack cocaine use. Permutation analysis also provided evidence that dispersion of substance use, and the association between ego and alter use was not random for all substances.ConclusionsIn a socially marginalized neighborhood, social network topology was strongly influenced by residence, and in turn was associated with type(s) of substance use. Associations between personal use and supporter's use of a substance differed across substances. These complex associations may merit consideration in the design of interventions to reduce risk and harms associated with substance use in people living in precarious housing.",2019,,PLOS ONE,14,9,,WOS:000532303200023,10.1371/journal.pone.0222611,,#2929,Knerich 2019,,
Using financial incentives to support service engagement of adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness: A qualitative analysis of key stakeholder perspectives,"Reid, N; Brown, R; Pedersen, C; Kozloff, N; Sosnowski, A; Stergiopoulos, V","Introduction Homelessness and mental illness are associated with poor service engagement, health and health service use outcomes. Existing literature suggests that financial incentives may effectively support service engagement of this population, but studies investigating key stakeholder perspectives are lacking. This study aimed to elicit, using qualitative methods, nuanced service user and provider experiences by using financial incentives to support service engagement among adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness. Methods This qualitative study is part of a larger mixed-methods pragmatic trial of financial incentives (Coordinated Access to Care for the Homeless-Financial Incentives [CATCH-FI]) within a community-based brief case management programme (CATCH) in Toronto, Ontario. Twenty-two CATCH-FI participants were purposefully recruited to participate in in-depth, semi-structured interviews; five CATCH service providers participated in a focus group and seven key informants in individual interviews. Data collection occurred between April 2019 and December 2020. All interviews and the focus group were audio-recorded and transcribed. Topic guides prompted participant perspectives on and experiences of using financial incentives to support engagement, health and well-being. Grounded theory and inductive thematic analysis guided coding and interpretation of transcripts. Triangulation and member-checking enhanced the analytical rigour and validity of findings. Results CATCH service providers, key informants and subgroup of CATCH-FI participants perceived financial incentives to directly facilitate service engagement. The majority of CATCH-FI participants however highlighted that intrinsic motivation and service quality may be relatively more important facilitators of engagement. Most study participants across stakeholder groups perceived that financial incentives have direct positive influences on health and well-being in enabling access to basic needs and simple pleasures. Conclusions Our data suggest that for some adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness, financial incentives can directly support service engagement. In addition, financial incentives may positively impact health and well-being by easing financial stress and enabling deeper attention to individual health needs. Further research on the effectiveness and acceptability of financial incentives is needed to improve understanding and uptake of a promising intervention to support health and health service use outcomes in an underserved population.

Park characteristics preferred for adolescent park visitation and physical activity: A choice-based conjoint analysis using manipulated photographs,"Van Hecke, L; Ghekiere, A; Van Cauwenberg, J; Veitch, J; De Bourdeaudhuij, I; Van Dyck, D; Clarys, P; Van De Weghe, N; Deforche, B","Adolescents should engage in 60 min of physical activity daily in order to obtain health benefits. Creating environments supportive for physical activity, could be a valuable strategy to increase physical activity at the population level. The purpose of this study was to understand the relative importance of park characteristics for park visitation and park-based physical activity among adolescents, using manipulated photographs of parks. Participants (n = 1197) were asked to perform two sets of ten choice tasks. For each choice task, a choice had to be made between two photographs of a park where ten characteristics were manipulated: naturalness, upkeep, walking paths, outdoor fitness equipment/playground, sport field, benches, drinking fountain, peers, mother with children and homeless person. In the first set of choice tasks participants had to select the park most inviting for visitation, in the second, they had to select the park most inviting for physical activity. Hierarchical Bayes Estimations were used to calculate (1) average utilities that represent the desirability of each level within a characteristic and (2) importance scores which reflect the effect each park characteristic had on the choice. The results indicate that park upkeep was the most important characteristic for park visitation and physical activity followed by the presence of playground/outdoor fitness equipment and sport fields. Policymakers could ensure that parks are well maintained, have sport fields and outdoor fitness equipment in order to meet adolescents' needs. Evaluation of such initiatives can confirm whether these park characteristics will influence actual adolescent park visitation and park-based physical activity.",2018,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,178,,144-155,WOS:000442710400015,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.05.017,,#2932,VanHecke 2018,,

This study aims to guide scholarly and activist understandings of homelessness, communication, and employment by exploring homeless young adults' struggles and tactics regarding work. Specifically, we argue that homeless young adults experience a 'scaffolded city' phenomenon, where regulated employment is all but out of reach due to the mutually reinforcing structures undergirding work and home. These built, imagined, and discursive structures manifest as domestic, bureaucratic, social support, and health barriers. We also highlight various tactics used by homeless young adults to navigate life and work despite these barriers, including communicating intentionally, coordinating nonprofit organizational resources, connecting to a higher purpose, maintaining motivation, and seeking entrepreneurial opportunities.

"Experiences, perceptions and expectations of health services amongst marginalized populations in urban Australia: A meta-ethnographic review of the literature","Baker, K; Adams, J; Steel, A","Background Poor health outcomes amongst marginalized groups result in part from health inequities related to social and structural determinants of health. Marginalized people report higher incidences of comorbidities, chronic disease and adverse health behaviours than their nondisadvantaged peers. The objective of this review is to examine marginalized Australians' experiences of and access to community-based primary health services in urban locations. Methods A systematic search incorporating related MeSH terms and synonyms pertaining to marginalized Australian populations and their health-seeking was conducted across seven databases. We included qualitative studies that reported experiences of health-seeking within community-based primary health care in metropolitan Australia. Participant populations experiencing marginalization due to social stigma and isolation, early-life disadvantage, poor health and/or financial hardship were included. A meta-ethnographic framework was used to synthesize themes across selected studies and researcher triangulation was employed to develop higher-order themes. Results Search results revealed 26 studies included for critical appraisal and synthesis. Seven higher-order themes were developed describing experiences of health service engagement amongst marginalized groups: (1) Understanding the patient within the context of family and community, (2) Health and cultural beliefs influence health-seeking, (3) Lack of information and poor cultural competence limit utilization of services, (4) Motivation for treatment influences health service engagement, (5) Accessing services, a spectrum of experience-from discrimination to validation, (6) Navigating a complex system in a complex society, (7) Preferences for health care and expectations for systemic change. Conclusion Marginalized Australians experience health disadvantage across micro, meso and macro levels of health system navigation and commonalities in health-seeking were identified across each of the distinct marginalized groups in our analysis.

"Exploring the conceptualization, operationalization, implementation, and measurement of outreach in community settings with hard-to-reach and hidden populations: A scoping review","Jiao, S; Slemon, A; Guta, A; Bungay, V","Outreach is as a strategy employed by those in health and social services, which generally involves establishing relationships and providing support to people situated in hard-to-reach and hidden populations. However, there is a lack of clarity across the literature on how outreach is conceptualized, the central elements of outreach as a program and practice, and how the `success' of outreach is empirically measured. Such gaps limit understandings of how outreach can be most effectively implemented and evaluated. The purpose of this scoping review responds to these challenges by systematically examining how outreach has been conceptualized, operationalized, and evaluated in community settings with hard-to-reach and hidden populations. This scoping review approach was undertaken in accordance with the 6-step framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and advanced by Levac and colleagues. The search was conducted across four databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsycINFO) and included research, review, and non-empirical articles published in English between January 1, 2008 and April 20, 2020.16,238 records were screened by title and abstract, followed by a review of 654 full-text articles and critical appraisal of 67 articles. Forty-two articles were included in the review, including 28 research articles (90%), two review, and two non-empirical. Findings illustrate that there is considerable variation in how outreach is conceptualized, implemented, and evaluated across the literature. Further, outreach is often inadequately defined, and predominantly overlooks the underlying and systemic reasons for clients' ""disengagement"" from health and social care.

Bridging institutional logics: Implementing naloxone distribution for people exiting jail in three California counties,"Showalter, D; Wenger, LD; Lambdin, BH; Wheeler, E; Binswanger, I; Kral, AH","Drug overdose is the leading cause of death among formerly incarcerated people. Distribution of the opioid overdose medication naloxone to people who use drugs reduces overdose mortality, and officials in many jurisdictions are now considering or implementing programs to offer naloxone to people exiting jails and prisons. The principles and practices of harm reduction programs such as naloxone distribution conflict with those of penal institutions, raising the question of how organizations based on opposing institutional logics can collaborate on lifesaving programs. Using in-depth interviews and observations conducted over four years with 34 penal, medical, public health, and harm reduction practitioners, we introduce and conceptualize two organizational features to explain why this therapeutic intervention was implemented in local jails in two of three California counties.

"The relation of basic self-disturbance to self-harm, eating disorder symptomatology and other clinical features: Exploration in an early psychosis sample","Rasmussen, AR; Reich, D; Lavoie, S; Li, E; Hartmann, JA; McHugh, M; Whitford, TJ; Nelson, B","Background and Aims The notion of basic self-disturbance has been proposed as a core feature of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and as an indicator of future transition to psychosis in high-risk populations. However, the relation of this notion to many clinical characteristics has not been explored. The aim of this study was: (a) to investigate the distribution of self-disturbance and other symptoms dimensions in ultra-high risk (UHR), first-episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy control groups; and (b) to explore the association of self-disturbance with a history of self-harm, suicidal attempt, eating disorder symptomatology, school bullying victimization and sexual or physical abuse. Methods Patients with UHR status (n = 38) or FEP (n = 26) and healthy controls (n = 33) were assessed with the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE) and the Comprehensive Assessment of at Risk Mental States (CAARMS). The clinical-historical variables were assessed through medical records. Results The FEP group scored significantly higher on the EASE than the UHR group, which scored significantly higher than the healthy control group, which had a very low score. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that higher EASE score was significantly associated with a history of self-harm, disordered eating and bullying victimization (but not with suicide attempts or sexual/physical abuse) after controlling for positive, negative and depressive symptoms. Conclusion These novel findings suggest that self-disturbance may be related to a history of school bullying victimization, self-harm and eating disorder symptomatology in patients with or at-risk of psychosis. If further confirmed, these findings are potentially relevant to clinical risk assessment and therapy.",2020,,EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY,14,3,275-282,WOS:000473912700001,10.1111/eip.12850,,#2943,Rasmussen 2020,,

Exploring Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs and Associated Barriers of Homeless Young Adults in Urban Ghana: A Qualitative Study,"Adedze, M; Osei-Yeboah, R; Morhe, ESK; Ngambouk, VP","Background Homelessness has become a major global and public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This phenomenon predisposes young adults to severe psychosocial and health challenges. Aim To explore the sexual and reproductive health needs and behaviours of homeless young adults and challenges in accessing these services. Methods A semi-structured interview guide was used for data collection from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Data were collected between 01 June and 31 July 2020 from 30 participants using in-depth interviews, two focus group discussions involving 12 participants, and one key informant interview. Thematic analysis was used to analyse transcripts from the interviews. Results The findings show that certain behavioural patterns associated with homelessness impact the lives of homeless young adults in their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) choices, beliefs, and perspectives. This group faces several challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS) such as modern contraceptives and abortion care. The high cost, and undesirable and unfriendly attitude of service providers in health facilities pose as barriers to accessing SRHS by homeless young adults. Conclusion Sustainable and proactive measures must be put in place to address the identified barriers. Timely delivery of accurate information and educative materials, ensuring affordability, and setting up of accessible and friendly facilities could improve SRHS for this group.

Access to Contraceptives in School-Based Health Centers: Progress and Opportunities,"Sullivan, EE; Love, HL; Fisher, RL; Schlitt, JJ; Cook, EL; Soleimanpour, S","Introduction: The U.S. has a higher adolescent pregnancy rate than other industrialized countries. School-based health centers can improve access to contraceptives among youth, which can prevent unplanned pregnancies. This cross-sectional study examines the characteristics and predictors of contraceptive provision at school-based health centers in 2016-2017 and changes in and barriers to provision between 2001 and 2017.Methods: In 2020-2021, the authors conducted analyses of the National School-Based Health Care Census data collected from 2001 to 2017. The primary outcome of interest was whether adolescent-serving school-based health centers dispense contraceptives, and a secondary outcome of interest was the policies that prohibit school-based health centers from dispensing contraceptives. A multivariate regression analysis examined the associations between contraceptive provision and various covariates, including geographic region, years of operation, and provider team composition.Results: Less than half of adolescent-serving school-based health centers reported providing contraceptives on site. Those that provided contraceptives were more likely located in the Western and Northeastern regions of the U.S., older in terms of years of operation, and staffed by a wide variety of health provider types. Among school-based health centers that experienced policy barriers to providing access to contraceptive methods, most attributed the source to the school or school district where the school-based health center was located.Conclusions: School-based health centers are an evidence-based model for providing contraceptives to adolescents but not enough are providing direct access. Understanding the predictors, characteristics, and barriers influencing the provision of contraceptives at school-based health centers may help to expand the number doing so.

Out of the System and onto the Streets: LGBTQ-Identified Youth Experiencing Homelessness with Past Child Welfare System Involvement,"Forge, N; Hartinger-Saunders, R; Wright, E; Ruel, E","Youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ), are over-represented in the child welfare system and also among people experiencing homelessness. This article reports on the experiences of youth who identify as LGBTQ and also have previous child welfare system involvement-as compared to youth identifying as heterosexual, cisgender-as a subsample of youth experiencing homelessness in a southeastern metropolitan area. The study sample was comprised of primarily black males who reported an average age of 21. Approximately one third of youth identified as LGBTQ. Over half of the youth in the sample had been in foster care, while 43% indicated some other form of child welfare system involvement. Of those who had been in the foster care system, 11% were eligible to return to care based on their age. When compared to their heterosexual, cis-gender counterparts, a greater percentage of youth who are LGBTQ had been kicked out of their homes, had been homeless for more than one year, reported being abused as a child, were victimized while they were homeless, indicated a mental health problem, and identified adult friends or a professional contact (rather than family members) as a source of support. Fully 95% of both groups in the sample reported some form of trauma. Findings support the need for child welfare system workers to adopt identity affirming, trauma-informed practices with youth who are in care and highlight the challenges in preparing youth for successful, independent living.

Validation of interaction-based egocentric elicitation using ecological momentary assessment with young adults currently or formerly homeless,"Semborski, S; Rhoades, H; Rice, E; Henwood, BF","Introduction: Social network changes are common as individuals transition from homeless to Supportive Housing. Egocentric approaches to elicit network members have been utilized with young adults experiencing homelessness to better understand such socio-environmental contexts; however, such approaches are subject to recall bias. Momentary measurements of one's social network via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) can support in understanding the accuracy of egocentric elicitation methods.Objective: To examine who is elicited using an interaction-based approach in egocentric social network analysis among currently homeless and formerly homeless young adults residing in Supportive Housing and explore which alters are reported in interactions and how often are they reported when egocentric network analysis is embedded in EMA.Methods: The present study utilizes interaction-based elicitation embedded within Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) in two sub-samples: currently homeless young adults (n = 72) and formerly homeless young adults residing in Supportive Housing (n = 118). Results: Most egos interacted with three of their top five alters, while only 8.9% interacted with all five. Conversely, only 2% of egos reported that they did not interact with any of their top five. Several differences in alter characteristics were identified by housing status. Alters indicated as being more supportive are elicited first and alters elicited first are interacted with the most.Conclusions: EMA findings suggest that a cross-sectional social network survey of top five alters will results in an ordered list, with the most important/frequent alter being named first and trend downward. Results have implications for future study design involving egocentric network analyses. Present findings indicate qualities of alters present and thus, offer plausible ""best practices"" when utilizing network elicitation methods, particularly interaction-based methods.",2023,,SOCIAL NETWORKS,73,,72-79,WOS:000919072500001,10.1016/j.socnet.2023.01.002,,#2952,Semborski 2023,,

Navigating Complex Implementation Contexts: Overcoming Barriers and Achieving Outcomes in a National Initiative to Scale Out Housing First in Canada,"Macnaughton, E; Nelson, G; Worton, SK; Tsemberis, S; Stergiopoulos, V; Aubry, T; Hasford, J; Distasio, J; Goering, P","HighlightsHousing First can be implemented beyond demonstration sites without new resources. Using an intentional implementation strategy communities implemented high-fidelity programs. One key implementation challenge was accessing affordable housing and housing subsidies. By helping develop housing specialists and reflective practice, the TTA facilitated effective implementation.Abstract The scaling out of Housing First (HF) programs was examined in six Canadian communities, in which a multi-component HF training and technical assistance (TTA) was provided. Three research questions were addressed: (a) What were the outcomes of the TTA in terms of the development of new, sustained, or enhanced programs, and fidelity to the HF model? (b) How did the TTA contribute to implementation and fidelity? and (c) What contextual factors facilitated or challenged implementation and fidelity? A total of 14 new HF programs were created, and nine HF programs were sustained or enhanced. Fidelity assessments for 10 HF programs revealed an average score of 3.3/4, which compares favorably with other HF programs during early implementation. The TTA influenced fidelity by addressing misconceptions about the model, encouraging team-based practice, and facilitating case-based dialogue on site specific implementation challenges. The findings were discussed in terms of the importance of TTA for enhancing the capacities of the HF service delivery systempractitioners, teams, and communitieswhile respecting complex community contexts, including differences in policy climate across sites. Policy climate surrounding accessibility of housing subsidies, and use of Assertive Community Treatment teams (vs. Intensive Case Management) were two key implementation issues.",2018,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,62,2-Jan,135-149,WOS:000444940800012,10.1002/ajcp.12268,,#2955,Macnaughton 2018,,
Enabling evidence-led collaborative systems-change efforts: an adaptation of the collective impact approach,"Nichols, N; Schwan, K; Gaetz, S; Redman, M","This article conveys the results of a three-year ethnographic study of a pan-Canadian community-university collaboration to prevent and end youth homelessness. The collaboration adapted aspects of a collective impact (CI) approach to pursue a large-scale shift in how youth homelessness is addressed in Canada. The objective of this article is to codify and share the model developed and implemented by the community-university collaboration as an opportunity for ongoing adaptation and learning among others undertaking similarly complex and collaborative systems-change efforts. Findings suggest a CI approach is unlikely to be suitable for large-scale innovation-oriented initiatives, and that context-specific adaptations of the model should be encouraged.

Objective: Our objective was to examine the effects of food insecurity and momentary hunger on momentary stress and stress variability in a sample of currently and formerly homeless young adults. Method: We used a 7-day ecological momentary assessment study querying affect, hunger, and risky behaviors. A mixed-effects location scale model was used to examine the effects of hunger on mean levels and within- and between-subjects variability of stress with 100 currently homeless and 69 formerly homeless young adults ages 18-29 in Los Angeles County, California. Results: When individuals experienced greater-than-average hunger, they then experienced greater stress variability at the next prompt, showing the impact of hunger on stress at the momentary level. Those with higher average levels of stress, regardless of hunger, became substantially more stressed when becoming hungry compared to their generally less stressed counterparts. Conclusions: The study shows the extent to which food insecurity results in erratic stress among vulnerable populations and how high levels of hunger may lead to a more inconsistent stress response.

American panhandlers,"Leeson, PT; Hardy, RA","Urban panhandling and its regulation are global phenomena. Panhandling regulation, like other regulation, is likely to be effective only if it is informed about that which it regulates. We investigate whether American panhandling regulation is informed by examining what information about American panhandlers is available to inform it. Information is available about panhandlers' demographics, housing, income, and psychological health. Information is not available about the determinants of panhandling activities. Since those activities are the target of panhandling regulation, this suggests that American panhandling regulation is uninformed. And since American panhandlers are among the most studied in the world, it further suggests that panhandling regulation in most other countries may also be uninformed. Economic analysis of the potential (in)effectiveness of uninformed panhandling regulation suggests that existing panhandling regulation in US cities may not reduce public nuisance associated with panhandlers and may even increase it.",2022,,CITIES,124,,,WOS:000753653900003,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103601,,#2961,Leeson 2022,,

The importance of discourse in homelessness policy for young people: an Australian perspective,"Kuskoff, E","Homelessness among young people remains an ongoing critical issue across the globe, despite numerous targeted policies attempting to address the issue. Research demonstrates that the way policies represent social problems influences policy solutions. Drawing on Australian policy, this research investigates how policy discourses construct homeless young people, and how these constructions influence the support services developed. The study involves a critical discourse analysis of Australia's most recent national inquiry report on homelessness among young people. The analysis suggests that the values and assumptions present throughout this policy largely reflect neoliberal political contexts, emphasising the importance of individual and community responsibility.

A Failed Attempt at Participatory Video With Takatapui/LGBTIQ plus People Who Had Experienced Homelessness,"Fraser, B; Chisholm, E; Pierse, N","This paper provides insights into a failed attempt at participatory video (PV). PV has long been favoured by researchers working with marginalised communities. However, there is limited discourse about when the method is and is not appropriate, and few published examples of when it has failed. It is important to critique research methods, and for researchers to be transparent about when research is not carried out as originally intended. Such reflection allows us to refine the methods we use and improve our research. This paper explores what a failed PV project with Takatapui/LGBTIQ+ people who had experienced homelessness taught us about the stigmatised nature of both homelessness and LGBTQ+ identities. Furthermore, it shows how methods that do not allow for participants to maintain their anonymity are sometimes not the right choice when researching stigmatised issues.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS,21,,,WOS:000802816000001,10.1177/16094069221103663,,#2972,Fraser 2022,,
Nudging Subjects at Risk: Social Impact Bonds between Financialization and Compassion,"Wirth, M","This paper explores the consequences of a recent Social Impact Bond (SIB) implementation in the UK at the level of everyday practices in three youth homelessness charities. By focusing on the effects of measuring and valuation devices, it is argued that the SIB transforms the way social welfare is delivered: it redefines practices, relationships, and interactions within service provision along the ambiguous dynamics of marketization processes. On the one hand, this is characterized by moments of creative articulation whereby service interventions connect a multitude of logics and narratives and exhibit both an emotionalized and behaviorist content. On the other hand, as this paper shows, economic principles underpinning the SIB are performatively actualized in the scheme, shaping interactions and relationships. The paper concludes that these two processes should be conceived not as mutually exclusive but as concomitant, yet conflictive forces that shape the marketization process of SIBs.",2020,,HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG,45,3,184-205,WOS:000555083800009,10.12759/hsr.45.2020.3.184-205,,#2973,Wirth 2020,,

From 2015 to 2016, this coalition created QSA surveys focusing on both provider- and youth-reported quality, each providing its own unique angle for the assessment. Factor analysis was used to identify two underlying dimensions of youth perceptions of quality, encompassing both interpersonal interactions and benefits of the services received.

Crisis temporalities and ongoing capabilities in the lives of young people growing up on the streets of African cities: An ethnographic longitudinal perspective,"van Blerk, L; Hunter, J; Shand, W","Understanding young people's lives through a focus on their micro-geographies has been central for exercising young people's voices through research. However, such a focus has also neglected the multiple and complex realities of growing up that ripple throughout their lives, resulting in calls for more research to go beyond capturing daily snapshots of experience. This paper acknowledges that decades of research with and for young people living on city streets has underpinned activism and challenged western child rights discourse, helping to ensure that abuses and violations of street young people's rights are confronted. Yet, much of this research draws attention to lives lived in present moments - the difficulties encountered and capabilities displayed. It does not account for the temporal fluidity of how young people's realities are future impacted by slow crises and challenging daily life experiences as they grow towards adulthood. This paper explores the crisis temporalities of young people's street lives through a youth-led ethnographic longitudinal approach. The paper focuses on 18 youth researchers and over 200 of their peers' experiences of research over three years while living on the streets of three African cities. The paper discusses the challenges of undertaking longitudinal research alongside the temporal affordances of surviving urban informality and the compounding effects of slow crises on present and future-oriented survival. These affordances emerge as street youth respond to daily trials, experience setbacks, crises, triumphs, and failures, yet show resilience and employ capabilities. The paper concludes by demonstrating the crucial importance of ethnographic longitudinal research for policy and practice to ensure that youth who age on the streets, and their families, are supported in accordance with social justice concerns.",2024,,AREA,56,1,,WOS:001031146600001,10.1111/area.12892,,#2978,vanBlerk 2024,,

'Homelessness is a queer experience.': utopianism and mutual aid as survival strategies for homeless trans people,"England, E","Trans people are at considerably elevated risk of homelessness, yet services poorly meet their needs. I explore how community support, anchored in queer praxis and concrete utopian thinking enables trans people to survive homelessness. Drawing upon interviews with 35 trans people who have recently experienced homelessness in Wales, I explore how queer practices of mutual aid, contextualized by utopian possibility, engender community support for trans people experiencing homelessness. I argue that trans and queer communities provide extensive, often exhausting, practical, material and emotional support which counters well-established queer exclusion within statutory services. I show that community support is critical to the survival of homeless trans people within a complex and unwelcoming system, and that informal crisis alternatives are enabled by idealism, hope and pragmatism. These findings are important in visibilising how shared precarity produces practices of care, in offering strategies to address inequitable service failures, and in demonstrating the relevance of queer theoretical approaches to housing justice.",2022,,HOUSING STUDIES,,,,WOS:000838598400001,10.1080/02673037.2022.2108381,,#2981,England 2022,,

Moreover, black students were over three times more likely to experience literal homelessness than white students.

Second, the paper considers the performative work of such practices in negotiating existing, and affirming new, homeless subject-positions. In doing so, it highlights the potential of spirituality in bringing homeless people's inner worlds to the surface, challenging their agency, performativity and self-perceptions.

Limited prior research has captured what, specifically, promotes PSOC among young people. METHODS: This scoping review systematically surveys literature (N = 13 articles) to understand what practices and settings foster PSOC among young people who experience social marginalization. RESULTS: Six broad practices are found to foster PSOC: adult/mentor support, peer/social support, youth power and influence, community participation/involvement, connecting by shared identity, and specific program features. Community settings are the predominant settings in which PSOC appears to be fostered. CONCLUSION: Practitioners who work with young people in community settings may consider foregrounding these practices within their work when seeking to foster a psychological sense of community.

Building on previous research, this study developed a statistical typology of runaway youth offenders using a sample of 29,204 runaway youth referred to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. Based upon key predictors and features of adolescent runaways including abuse, trauma, antisocial peers, delinquency, mental illness, school problems, and more, a series of latent class analysis models indicate that five sub-types of runaways exist within three larger behavioral/feature domains. These results suggest that runaways are a heterogeneous group with highly unique experiences and risk factors that occur before and after the runaway experience.

Does Sexual Violence Victimization Contribute to Deviant Behavior?

In this paper, we examine the relationship between a unique type of strain - sexual violence victimization - and several deviant outcomes. Drawing on GST, we hypothesize that sexual violence victimization will increase the odds of substance abuse, alcohol use, and violent/aggressive behavior and that feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression will mediate the relationship between these factors. To test these relationships, we use data from the Kaplan Longitudinal and Multigenerational Study. Results indicate that sexual violence victimization increases all three types of deviant behavior. Negative affect, however, does not mediate the relationship.

Affects have not previously been examined in depth in a street context, despite their impact on the experiences and behaviour of street children. Street affects emerge in and through encounters between the human and non-human elements of the urban environment. When a set of affects arise and endure through time, street dwellers may experience them as affective atmospheres and respond in particular ways. They may also try to manipulate affects and to thereby change affective atmospheres, and yet the success of such efforts can never be guaranteed. This article shows that manipulating affect on the streets of Pelotas is a way to obtain and wield power, and that power hierarchies on the streets are partly based on successful affect manipulation.

A logistic regression model included unwanted sexual touching, partner abuse, identifying as bisexual, African American, higher age, gender (women more likely), homelessness, a higher number of sexual partners, having anal sex, injection drug use, HIV seropositivity, crack use, and the likelihood of injecting drugs. The model was retested on independently collected Risk Behavior Assessment (RBA) data and showed significant relationships between survival sex and crack use, gender (women more likely), HIV positivity, identifying as bisexual, having anal sex, African American, and a higher number of sex partners.

Using Vignettes to Assess Gendered Responses to Strain: The Role of Negative State Emotion in Predicting Male vs. Female Intentions to Offend,"Manasse, M; Antunes, MJL; Ganem, N","This study examines Broidy and Agnew's propositions that gender disparity in crime may be due to (1) male and females' experience of distinct emotional reactions to strain and (2) male and females' response to these emotional reactions with distinct levels of offending. Using a vignette study design with measures spanning a broad range of state emotions and conditioning variables, this study adds to the range of emotion and conditioning variables currently considered in the GST literature, providing a particularly robust test of GST. As expected, results indicate females experience more complex emotional responses to strain, and males are more likely to respond to equivalent types of state negative emotion with intentions to offend. Differences in criminal propensities are largely explained by variables outlined as important GST moderators. Variations by vignette and emotion reveal a more complex relationship between gender, emotion and offending than previously demonstrated.",2021,,WOMEN & CRIMINAL JUSTICE,31,4,242-260,WOS:000506623100001,10.1080/08974454.2019.1706697,,#2999,Manasse 2021,,
"Police Contact, Procedural Injustice, and Drug Use","Baron, SW; Macdonald, S","Drawing on general strain theory, this article explores whether young people's perceptions of procedural injustice in their interactions with police, as well as their economic dissatisfaction, are associated with drug use. We examine whether levels of police contact increase the likelihood of perceptions of procedural injustice, and if the relationships between procedural injustice and drug use as well as economic dissatisfaction and drug use are influenced by associations with drug-using peers, legal cynicism, and levels of social support. Using a sample of 449 individuals aged 16-30 years in three Canadian cities, the findings suggest that police contact has a direct relationship with drug use, but it also has an indirect relationship mediated by procedural injustice. Further, economic dissatisfaction, homelessness, legal cynicism, and drug-using peers are also associated with greater drug use. The relationships between procedural injustice and drug use and economic dissatisfaction and drug use are stronger at lower levels of social support. Findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are offered.",2020,,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE,62,1,25-Jan,WOS:000537117400001,10.3138/cjccj.2019-0028,,#3000,Baron 2020,,
Assessing the Relationship Between Physical Health and Inmate Misconduct,"Grosholz, JM; Semenza, DC","Research reveals inmate misconduct results from various factors including age, gang membership, program participation, and mental illness. However, no research has examined the influence of physical illness on misconduct. Per general strain theory, we argue that poor physical health is a significant strain that may negatively affect behavior. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics' 2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF), we investigate how acute illnesses, chronic conditions, and physical disabilities influence misconduct. Results suggest acute conditions increase the likelihood of general, serious, and nonserious misconduct in prison. Conversely, chronic ailments decrease the likelihood of all types of misconduct. We find moderate effects for physical disability. Experiencing acute health conditions while incarcerated significantly increases the likelihood of misconduct, suggesting that by appropriately addressing inmates' acute ailments, it may be possible to concurrently improve inmate health and decrease misconduct to enhance the lives of those in prison.",2018,,CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR,45,10,1527-1546,WOS:000444580500004,10.1177/0093854818775467,,#3001,Grosholz 2018,,
"Assessing general strain theory and measures of victimization, 2002-2018","Barbieri, N; Clipper, SJ; Narvey, C; Rude, A; Craig, JM; Piquero, NL","General Strain Theory (GST) is one of the leading theories of crime and delinquency in the field of criminology, with victimization identified as a leading source of strain due to the frequency and prevalence of its experience. However, measures of victimization widely range from direct experiences of physical violence to vicarious or even anticipated victimization, making it difficult to isolate the explanatory contribution of GST on crime and delinquency. A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles to provide a concise understanding of the relationship between victimization and crime and delinquency. Particular attention was given to definitions and operationalization of victimization, as well as whether the studies used longitudinal or cross-sectional samples. Findings suggest a discernible correlation between physical victimization measures and engagement in substance use, bullying behaviors, and general delinquency.

Marketized mentality and instrumental offending: the overlooked roles of noneconomic institutions and relative deprivation in individual level institutional anomie theory,"Baron, SW","This research examines the individual level extension to institutional anomie theory and explores the link between a marketized mentality and instrumental offending. Further, it investigates the direct roles that family, school and relative deprivation play in offending and probes their possible moderating impact on the relationship between a marketized mentality and illegal activities. Utilizing a street youth sample, the findings reveal that a marketized mentality in and of itself does not have a direct link to instrumental offending. Instead, the association between marketized mentality and offending emerges under conditions where individuals experience low family social control and high levels of relative deprivation. Relative deprivation, criminal peers, moral filters, prior offending, and low self-control also contribute directly to an increased probability of instrumental offending, while under certain conditions school social control decreases these probabilities.

Using photovoice, we reconstruct former street children's definitions of and feelings about their spaces in the city, bringing into view a complex set of social problems, attitudes and strategies that moves beyond the traditional binary notion of street children as either deviants or victims. This work points to the importance of finding ways to ensure the voices of marginalized and disadvantaged children are heard and presents the narratives that are important to our understanding of their worlds.

Isolating the effect of eviction on criminal convictions: Results from a Swedish study,"Alm, S","On an individual level, criminal offending is linked to resource deficiencies. Since evictions tend to affect society's weakest groups, we would expect evicted individuals to be convicted of crime to a higher degree than others even before eviction. But is there also a direct effect of eviction on criminal convictions? The aim of this study was to isolate the effect of eviction on criminal convictions. Propensity score matching was used and the analyses included all individuals evicted in Sweden from 2009 to 2010 (n = 5050), and a 10% sample of the adult population (n = 770,000). After matching based on relevant background factors, the analyses showed a significant increase in criminal convictions from the year of eviction until the end of the period studied, two to three years later.

"Low Self-Control, Victimization, and Financial Hardship: Does Low Self-Control Moderate the Relationship Between Strain and Criminal Involvement?","Boccio, CM; Beaver, KM","General strain theory has been widely supported by empirical research. Research concerning possible individual-level moderators of the effects of strain, however, has yielded considerably mixed results. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining whether levels of self-control moderate the relationship between strain and criminal involvement in a large nationally representative sample. Our findings reveal that strain and levels of self-control have both additive and interactive effects on criminal involvement. To illustrate, respondents who were exposed to higher levels of strain reported more criminal involvement than respondents exposed to lower levels of strain. Similarly, lower levels of self-control were associated with higher levels of criminal involvement. In addition, levels of self-control were found to moderate the association between experiencing strain and two of the criminal involvement measures. Furthermore, the results suggest that the relationships among strain, self-control, and criminal involvement may vary across gender and forms of strain.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY,65,1,23-Mar,WOS:000525896800001,10.1177/0306624X20909211,,#3006,Boccio 2021,,
Longitudinal Risks for Domestic Violence,"Iratzoqui, A; Watts, SJ","Much research has examined the connections between victimization experiences in the family during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. However, research that frames these different victimization experiences across the life course as part of a broader, longitudinal risk for experiencing domestic violence on the part of the individual, particularly within a theoretically driven model, is lacking. The current study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of American adolescents, to examine how child abuse connects to victimization by dating partners during adolescence and victimization by romantic and marital partners during adulthood, and whether dating victimization mediates the relationship between child abuse and intimate partner victimization in adulthood. Results suggest that this is indeed the case, with child abuse having a direct effect on adolescent dating victimization and a direct and indirect effect on adult intimate partner victimization.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depressive symptoms. We used propensity score matching to balance the two groups (i.e., public assistance recipients and nonrecipients) and account for selection bias, then we conducted multivariate ordinary least squares regression analysis to examine the relationship between public assistance and depressive symptoms. Results: YAEH who had used public assistance had a significantly higher depression score (b=1.13, p=.004) than nonrecipients. Conclusions: Findings suggest many possible connections between public assistance use and depression, yet public assistance does not appear to improve mental health for a population facing multiple challenges and barriers.

Background Extant research indicates family rejection is a driving factor in the overrepresentation of LGBTQ young adults among young adults experiencing homelessness. Method This study analyzed two waves of interviews with 15 LGBTQ young adults. It addressed two research questions: (a) What kinds of heterosexist and cisgenderist rejection do LGBTQ young adults experience from their parents or guardians? and (b) How do LGBTQ young adults react to and experience that rejection? Results Participants reported multiple forms of heterosexist and cisgenderist rejection from their families, including increased heterosexism and cisgenderism in the home after coming out, increased arguments and conflict after coming out, abuse and neglect, silence and avoidance, control and isolation, and revoking young people's access to housing. Participants' responses to these forms of rejection included pain, disconnection from their families, feeling stifled in the home, and the desire to resist. Conclusion These findings illuminate specific forms and manifestations of heterosexist and cisgenderist family rejection and their impact on LGBTQ young adults.

Making a Bad Situation Worse: Current and Potential Unintended Consequences of Juvenile Registration for Sexual Offences,"Bosetti, RL; Fix, RL","Within the US, children and adolescents who engage in sexually abusive behavior are often subjected to sex offender registration and notification requirements, which contribute to stigmatization and forfeiture of their civil rights without empirical basis (Lancaster, 2011; Pickett et al., 2023; Zilney & Zilney, 2009). To date, 39 states subject children with adjudicated sexual offenses to sex offender registration requirements, with most recent estimates revealing that approximately 200,000 youth have been placed on sex offender registries within the US and many are now on the registry as adults (Pickett et al., 2020).

Part 2 presents the results of a systematic scoping review of research at the intersections of race and homelessness from 2016 to 2021. The 90 articles included demonstrate a growing, multidisciplinary body of literature that documents how needs and trajectories of people experiencing homelessness differ by race, examines how the racialized structuring of society contributes to homelessness risk, and explores how programs, policies, and grassroots action can address inequities. In addition to charting findings and implications, included studies are appraised against research principles developed by Critical Race Theory scholars, mapping the potential of existing research on race and homelessness to challenge racism.Research has begun to pay more attention to the role of racism in driving homelessness.I conducted a scoping review to map the methods and findings of recent US-based research.Recent studies include more qualitative methods; participants describe how race impacts experiences.Research is beginning to examine how homeless services and policies can reduce disparities.Applying critical theoretical frameworks may improve future research.",2023,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,72,4-Mar,464-485,WOS:001062028400001,10.1002/ajcp.12700,,#3015,Richard 2023,,
Understanding the link between alcohol dependence and victimisation risk: Is risk explained by peers or alcohol behaviours?,"Wojciechowski, T","BackgroundAlcohol dependence is a risk factor for experiencing victimisation, but little is known about how peer and behavioural mechanisms may explain this relationship. AimsTo test deviant peer association and/or heavy-episodic drinking frequency as mediators between alcohol dependence and risk for being victimised. MethodsThe Pathways to Desistance data were analysed. Generalised structural equation modelling was used to determine whether either or both of the hypothesised pathways significantly mediated the relationship between alcohol dependence and victimisation. ResultsAlcohol dependence at recruitment (age 14-17) was associated with higher odds of being a victim of some form of violence in Wave 3 (age x-y). This relationship was significantly mediated by deviant peer association but not heavy-episodic drinking frequency between Waves 2 and 3. ConclusionsThese findings add knowledge about the mechanism of a link between early alcohol dependence and later violent victimisation among young offenders. They suggest that more focus on reducing delinquent peer association, or reducing its impact, is crucial to reducing further harms to these young people, in turn possibly affecting continuing substance use and reoffending risks. Peer mentoring programmes help to provide prosocial modelling and reduce deviant peer ties in some circumstances, and these findings suggest that the next step should be their evaluation specifically among justice-involved young people with alcohol dependence.

Health and Care Utilization Among Youth With a History of Parental Incarceration and Homelessness,"So, MR; Davis, L; Barnes, AJ; Freese, R; Atella, J; Shlafer, RJ","Introduction: Despite widespread recognition of the health and social risks posed by parental incarceration (PI) and homelessness, these challenges are rarely considered in unison. We sought to (a) assess the experiences of homelessness among youth with and without a history of PI and (b) compare the health and healthcare utilization among youth with a combined history of PI and homelessness.Method: Examining data from eighth-, ninth-, and 11th-grade public school participants in the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 110,904), we calculated univariate and multivariate analyses to characterize the health status and care utilization of youth who have experienced PI, past-year homelessness, or both.Results: We observed higher prevalence of homelessness among youth with a history of PI compared to those without. The group with dual PI-homelessness experience had a higher proportion of youth that were younger, male, and non-White; and living in poverty or urban areas compared to youth with PI history only. Even after accounting for demographic factors, the dual PI-homelessness group evidenced higher expected odds for several physical health conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes), and differences in care utilization indicators relative to individual PI and homelessness groups.Discussion: Findings suggest that PI may be overrepresented among recently homeless youth and that youth with such dual experience possess distinct, and often elevated, health service needs. Health, education, housing, and other systems may need intersectoral strategies to better identify and support this at-risk subset of youth through clinical and policy approaches.",2023,,FAMILIES SYSTEMS & HEALTH,,,,WOS:001037229800001,10.1037/fsh0000830,,#3017,So 2023,,
Sense of community among young adults before and after moving into Permanent Supportive Housing: A mixed-methods longitudinal analysis,"Littman, DM; Resing, K; Milligan, T; Williams, O; Bender, K","Amidst chronic stressors and ongoing instability, many young people who have experienced homelessness and housing instability find communities and settings which offer support and care. Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) is one setting which aims to provide stability and community to those who have experienced homelessness, but it has not been widely studied with young adults (ages 18-25 upon moving into PSH). This paper employs a longitudinal convergent mixed methods approach - with quantitative and qualitative survey data over 1.5 years - to explore how young adult residents (N = 27 at T1; N = 20 at T2, N = 13 at T3) experience sense of community before and after moving into PSH. Using McMillan and Chavis' (1986) four-part Psychological Sense of Community (PSOC) framework to frame data collection and analysis, we find that residents' sense of community is shaped by an ongoing negotiation of personal and collective needs. Building community takes time and requires opportunities for voices to be heard (and shape change), along with ongoing personal growth - especially related to substance use recovery. Our findings offer insights for future PSH settings for young people - as well as other residential and community settings which aim to support young people. We suggest the need for future research which explores the tension of policy decision making, about substance use for example, in low-barrier support services like PSH.",2024,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,157,,,WOS:001146592300001,10.1016/j.childyouth.2023.107413,,#3018,Littman 2024,,
"How LGBTQ Adults Maintain Ties With Rejecting Parents: Theorizing ""Conflict Work"" as Family Work","Reczek, R; Bosley-Smith, E","Objective The present study examines how LGBTQ-identified adults maintain relationships with parents who reject their LGBTQ identity.Background Parents often reject their children's LGBTQ identity, sometimes leading to relationship dissolution. But how LGBTQ adults maintain parent-child relationships despite parents' rejection is less known. We answer this question with an empirical study of how LGBTQ adults maintain relationships with parents who reject their child's LGBTQ identity, drawing on conflict management theories and the concept ""family work,"" or the work done to promote family functioning.Method Qualitative in-depth interviews with 76 LGBTQ young adults are analyzed, supplemented with data from 44 of their parents.Results LGBTQ adults do extensive work to maintain their intergenerational bonds through what we theorize as ""conflict work."" We define conflict work as the effort done to manage severe conflict in a way that ensures family functioning, often at the expense of personal needs. Conflict work includes conflict education work (e.g., educating parents about LGBTQ identities), conflict avoidance work (e.g., don't ask, don't tell about LGBTQ identities), conflict acceptance work (e.g., ongoing but accepted conflict about LGBTQ identities), and conflict boundary work (e.g., asserting boundaries from parents over LGBTQ-related conflict).Conclusion LGBTQ adults maintain the parent-child bond by managing parents' rejection of their gender or sexuality identity through ""conflict work.""

Criminalized Masculinities: How Policing Shapes the Construction of Gender and Sexuality in Poor Black Communities,"Stuart, F; Benezra, A","With the intensification of policing and criminalization over the last three decades, residents of impoverished black communities are increasingly subject to street-level criminalization. This article examines how policing shapes the construction of gender and sexuality among its (potential) targets. Drawing on 12 months of fieldwork and interviews with 60 black youth living on Chicago's South Side, we find that in order to reduce the probability of a stop-and-frisk, young black men engage in reflexive and embodied masculinity performances. Aware that officers are most likely to detain and interrogate individuals who outwardly display toughness, emotional restrictiveness, and a proclivity for violence associated with the ""cool pose"" and the ""code of the street,"" youth attempt to communicate their innocence by exaggerating displays of emotional sensitivity, caring, vulnerability, and passivity. They concretely do so by overemphasizing (and even feigning) romantic involvement in heterosexual relationships-a strategy they refer to as ""getting cover."" Although ""doing masculinity"" in this manner may assist black youth in avoiding criminalization, it privileges dominant, mainstream (and often-unattainable) expressions of gender and sexuality while reinforcing hegemonic masculinity and heteronormativity. We offer a grounded, interactional framework for analyzing residents' situational and contingent responses to criminalization, which are characterized by a far greater degree of agency and innovation than previously assumed.",2018,,SOCIAL PROBLEMS,65,2,174-190,WOS:000441241000003,10.1093/socpro/spx017,,#3020,Stuart 2018,,
Experiences of Dating Violence and Protective Factors Among Adolescents in Vulnerable Contexts,"Rutman, SP; Loey, J; Decker, MJ; de Guzman, NS; Spitzer, J; Brindis, CD","Adolescents in vulnerable living contexts (e.g., foster care, juvenile justice facilities, and experiencing homelessness) may be at increased risk of adolescent dating violence victimization (ADV) due to unstable environments and trauma exposure. They may also experience different protective factors. Yet, research is limited on ADV in these contexts. This study assessed differences in ADV experiences among adolescents (10-21 years) in vulnerable contexts compared to adolescents at home utilizing data from a sexual health education program serving communities facing health inequities in California. Descriptive analyses compared adolescents in vulnerable contexts (n = 1,951) with those living at home (n = 10,682). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of experiencing past year physical and/or sexual ADV by context, controlling for sociodemographic variables. We also examined two potential protective factors: meaningful communication with a parent/guardian and pro-social friendships. Significantly more adolescents in vulnerable contexts than at home identified as male (65.6% vs. 51.6%), 18 years or older (16.5% vs. 8.7%), non-Hispanic Black or African American (14.4% vs. 5%), and LGBTQ+ (15.3% vs. 10.8%). Among adolescents who dated in the past year, 21% in vulnerable contexts reported experiencing physical and/or sexual ADV, compared to 15% of those at home, and reported lower levels of protective factors. Adolescents experiencing homelessness/unstable housing and those in juvenile justice facilities had greater adjusted odds of ADV compared to adolescents at home (56% and 54% higher odds, respectively). It is critical to address systemic factors, which disproportionately impact the most marginalized and disadvantaged adolescents, in approaches for ADV prevention.",2024,,JOURNAL OF AGGRESSION MALTREATMENT & TRAUMA,,,,WOS:001340800000001,10.1080/10926771.2024.2418546,,#3021,Rutman 2024,,
An Exploration of Sex Trading for Compensation and LGBTQ plus Inclusive Screening Practices: Perspectives of Young People who have Experienced Sex Trading and/or Homelessness,"Gerassi, LB; Cruys, C; Hendry, N; Rosales, MD","Young people's perspectives on social and healthcare providers' assessments of sex trading for financial compensation are lacking. This is particularly important for LGBTQ+ youth who experience substantial barriers in navigating health and social services. Further, increased internet access (because of COVID-19 and other factors) has changed the landscape of the sex trades in ways that are not fully understood. Our study aimed to understand (1) how young people trade sex, and (2) provider strategies that increase youths' comfort in disclosing sex trading and related risks. This community-based participatory research study surveyed currently or formerly homeless youth (ages 16-29). We co-created a cross sectional survey that explored youths' perceptions of: (1) sex trading type, compensation, and meaning; and (2) practices to increase youths' comfort in disclosing sex trading. Participants (N = 103; Mage = 22.9 [SD = 3.5]; 34% white, 55% ciswomen/21% trans; 51% queer) reported that ""sex trading"" signified multiple meanings, ranging from sex work/occupation to exploitation/ trafficking, and included diverse in-person and virtual forms for varied compensation types. Youth reported being more comfortable disclosing when the provider indicated they would advocate for them if they are victims of discrimination. Compared to cisgender youth, trans youth reported feeling significantly more comfortable disclosing sexual activity when a service provider used gender/sexuality inclusive practices (e.g., pronoun pins). Findings suggest important implications for gender-inclusive practice strategies to ultimately reduce potential harms of sex trading and multi-item measures to assess the complexity of sex trading.",2024,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,156,,,WOS:001111838800001,10.1016/j.childyouth.2023.107314,,#3022,Gerassi 2024,,
"Familial Sex Trafficking of Minors: Trafficking Conditions, Clinical Presentation, and System Involvement","Sprang, G; Cole, J","It is well documented in the literature that child sex trafficking can be perpetrated by family members, though limited research has focused on describing this type of sexual exploitation. This pilot study addresses this gap by providing an analysis of familial sex trafficking considering trafficking dynamics, and rurality. Using a sample of 31 child welfare-involved children referred for behavioral health assessment and treatment, this mixed methods study explores: (1) victim and trafficker characteristics, the trafficking situation, law enforcement classifications of trafficking, clinical profiles of victims, and system involvement of children and youth involved in familial sex trafficking; (2) gender differences in clinical outcomes in sex-trafficked children; and (3) geographical differences in severity of the victimization experience. Major findings document high rates of family members trafficking children for illicit drugs; high severity of abuse as measured with the Sexual Abuse Severity Score, with higher severity of abuse for children living in rural communities; clinical threshold level scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A). Boys and girls had similar clinical profiles except boys had higher CBCL externalizing scores, and females had higher TSCC depression scores. Additionally, more than half of the children in this sample had attempted suicide in their lifetime. This formative study sheds light on the phenomenon of familial sex trafficking, thereby creating the context for further investigations.

"Barriers to Accessing Detox Facilities, Substance Use Treatment, and Residential Services among Women Impacted by Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking","Gerassi, LB","More than 50% of women entering substance use treatment in the United States reported having traded sex for money or drugs. Women's participation in addiction treatment and related services is essential to their recovery and increased safety, stabilization, and quality of life. This article's aim is to explore the barriers related to accessing detox facilities and essential services including substance use treatment and residential services for women impacted by commercial sexual exploitation (CSE). Data are drawn from a larger, community-based, grounded theory study. In-depth interview data were collected from 30 adult women who traded sex as adults (through maximum variation and snowball sampling), as well as 20 service providers who come into contact with adult women who trade sex (through nominations and purposive sampling). Finding suggest that women often encountered sobriety requirements, which created barriers to accessing addiction treatment or residential services. Some organizations' policies required evicting women if they were caught using, which created additional challenges for women who relapsed. Women wanted to avoid becoming dopesick on the streets or at home, which partially contributed to them needing to maintain their addiction. Consequently, some returned to sex trading, thus increasing their risk of trafficking. Some women engaged in creative strategies, such as claiming they were suicidal, in order to access the detox facilities in hospitals. Some women indicated they were only able to detox when they were forced to do so in jail or prison, often without medical assistance. Implications to improve health care delivery for this population are discussed.",2018,,BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,44,3,199-208,WOS:000439714300004,10.1080/08964289.2017.1384360,,#3024,Gerassi 2018,,
Improvements in self-acceptance for LGBTQ plus and straight allied youth and young adults enrolled in an affirming system of care program,"Stevens, S; Haverly, K; Powell, C","Research indicates that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and young adults are at greater risk for mental health issues, including low levels of self-acceptance, when compared to heterosexual and cis-gendered peers. Many LGBTQ+ youth and young adults experience stress related to being a sexual minority and have difficulty accepting their sexual identity given non-affirming familial and social lived experiences. One promising approach for working with this population is providing affirmative care within a systems of care framework. This study examines outcomes of LGBTQ+ and cisgender straight allied youth and young adults following participation in iTEAM - an affirming system of care program. Data from 170 iTEAM participants who had both a pre- (intake) and 6-month post follow-up assessment were included in the analyses. Outcomes of interest include self-acceptance, employment, housing stability, and mental health of participants A factor analysis of the Self-Acceptance Scale resulted in four subscales: Self-Confidence, Social Confidence, Interpersonal Confidence, and Locus of Control. Changes from pre- to post-assessment indicate significant increases in overall self-acceptance and the four subscales along with employment and housing stability. Mental health scores improved, but not significantly. For the most part, these positive changes were evidenced for both LGBTQ+ and cisgender straight allied youth. The findings support the value of providing an affirming system of care program for both LGBTQ+ and straight allied youth in the same program setting. Additionally, programs should consider adding a measure of self-acceptance to inform clinical practice.",2020,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,118,,,WOS:000580051200065,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105382,,#3025,Stevens 2020,,
Identifying psychological resilience in Chinese migrant youth through multidisciplinary language pattern decoding,"Li, SJ; Lu, S; Ni, SG; Peng, KP","China's four decades of rural-to-urban labor migration has created 36 million migrant youth, who encounter more adversity than their urban peers due to educational and socioeconomic exclusion. This study focuses on the psychological resilience of these migrant youth since it indicates the ability or success to cope with adversity. We examine psychological resilience indicators based on migrant youth language patterns extracted in a multidisciplinary way. Our research questions are: whether Chinese migrant youths' language patterns indicate their resilience-related characteristics, and how effectively can three language analysis approaches (user-defined dictionary, feature extraction, and word co-occurrence) identify these indicators, which may be further applied as machine learning features for psychological resilience level estimation. Students in a middle school for migrant youth in Shenzhen, China were recruited as initial participants, and their resilience levels were rated by the Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. These youth then wrote one week of diary entries. The high- (n = 37) and low-resilience (n = 45) participants' writings were analyzed through the three language analysis approaches. The results suggest that Chinese migrant youth in this study present distinctive language patterns that closely relate to resilience indicators (positive emotion, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and positive affect), which can be further employed in differentiating resilience level (high vs. low) as machine learning features with satisfactory prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest a new interdisciplinary approach for effective psychological resilience identification among migrant youth in China and other high-risk youth populations.",2019,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,107,,,WOS:000501612900001,10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104506,,#3026,Li 2019,,
The Relationship Between Parent and Teacher Perceptions and the Academic Success of Homeless Youth,"Lafavor, T","Background Homeless and highly mobile (HHM) students experience early, persistent, and widening academic gaps across years of schooling. Behavioral regulation, critical in academic functioning, is related to parent and teacher perceptions of competence and engagement. Research demonstrates teachers report low-income children and children of color to have less self-regulation and report lower achievement expectations. Objective The current study examined the relationship between parent and teacher perceived behavioral regulation and academic engagement and competence in understanding the achievement of 9-11-year-old HHM youth living in emergency housing. Method The current study used objective measures of child cognitive and academic ability, and subjective parent and teacher report of child behavior and academic competence and engagement (N = 86 parent-child dyads and 48 teachers; Child: M-age = 10.5 years, 46% female, 86% racial/ethnic minority). Parents and children participated in concurrent sessions in the shelter; teachers completed measures and returned them by mail. Results Parents reported fewer behavioral problems on the BRIEF and higher perceived academic competence and engagement compared to teacher report. Parent perceived competence was related to both reading and math ability, while teacher perceptions were unrelated to objective testing. Teacher perceived engagement was associated with reading and math ability. Conclusions This study identifies important disparities between parents' and teachers' perceptions of competence and engagement compared to objective measurement of academic ability. Results suggest teachers in the current sample perceive HHM students as less competent and engaged regardless of objective testing. These findings are consistent with existing research among vulnerable students.",2020,,CHILD & YOUTH CARE FORUM,49,3,449-468,WOS:000533675300006,10.1007/s10566-019-09538-0,,#3027,Lafavor 2020,,
"Realising Capabilities for Street Young People in Harare, Zimbabwe: A New Approach to Social Protection","Chikoko, W; van Blerk, L; Hunter, J; Shand, W","Living in social contexts characterised by poverty and inequality, street young people have limited access to healthcare, water sanitation and hygiene services; exacerbating effects of ill health, infections, lack of nutrition and substance abuse that undermine their wellbeing. In Harare, Zimbabwe, they are also excluded from Social Protection Programmes (SPPs) which potentially assist other impoverished Zimbabweans, two-thirds of whom live below the poverty line (WFP 2019. Zimbabwe Annual Country Report 2019. World Food Programme). In this paper, we propose a reassessment of SPPs, in particular the Assisted Medical Treatment Order (AMTO), identifying barriers to access, and benefits for extending access to street young people. Drawing on secondary analysis of data from Growing up on the Streets, this paper re-conceptualises Ingrid Robeyns' (2005. ""The Capability Approach: A Theoretical Survey.""

Greater lifetime stressor exposure is associated with poorer mental health among sexual minority people of color,"Parra, LA; Spahr, CM; Goldbach, JT; Bray, BC; Kipke, MD; Slavich, GM","BackgroundResearch has shown that sexual minority people of color experience pervasive and sometimes severe life stressors that increase their risk of experiencing mental health problems, and that can contribute to lifelong health disparities. However, no studies in this population have investigated stressor exposure occurring over the entire lifespan. Moreover, it remains unknown whether these stressor-health effects differ based on the timing or types of stressors experienced. PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine how cumulative lifetime stressor exposure is associated with mental health among Black, Latinx, and biracial Black-Latinx sexual minority persons. MethodParticipants were 285 ethnic/racial minority young adults (M-age = 25.18 years old, SD = 1.94, age range = 19-29 years), who completed the Stress and Adversity Inventory for Adults to assess for retrospective reports of lifetime stressor count and severity. The Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess participants' symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, which were the main outcomes. Most participants identified as cisgender male (94.7%) and gay (74.2%), with the remaining participants identifying as transgender or genderqueer/nonbinary for gender and bisexual/pansexual, queer, or another sexual orientation. ResultsMultiple regression analyses indicated that experiencing more-and more severe-stressors across the lifespan was related to greater anxiety, depressive, and somatization symptoms. These effects were robust while controlling for race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, and employment status, and they differed based on stressor exposure timing, type, primary life domain, and core social-psychological characteristic. ConclusionGreater cumulative lifetime stressor exposure is related to poorer mental health among sexual minority people of color. Screening for lifetime stressors may thus help identify at-risk persons and provide an opportunity to intervene to help mitigate or prevent mental health disparities in multiply stigmatized adults.",2023,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY,79,4,1130-1155,WOS:000922234600001,10.1002/jclp.23463,,#3029,Parra 2023,,
The prevalence and correlates of running away among adolescents in the United States,"Castillo, B; Schulenberg, J; Grogan-Kaylor, A; Toro, PA","Runaway youth may experience a myriad of challenges associated with significant risks to health and well-being. To examine the prevalence and correlates of running away from home among US youth. Annual US nationally representative samples of 8th and 10th graders between 2005 and 2017 from the Monitoring the Future study. Self-reports of nationally representative samples of 8th and 10th graders in the US Annual survey data from 8th and 10th graders spanning 2005-2017, n = 116,520. The primary outcome of this study, running away from home in the past 12 months, was examined using multivariable weighted logistic regression. Predictor measures included: parent and peer relationships, school factors (e.g., grade point average [GPA]), internalizing symptoms, externalizing behavior, and substance use (alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes). Demographic measures in the model were grade level (8th or 10th), gender (boys or girls), parent education, and race/ethnicity. The annual prevalence of running away decreased significantly from 8.3% in 2005 to 6.1% in 2017. Demographically, running away from home was significantly lower among boys compared with girls. Multivariable logistic regression model results revealed that higher levels of parental involvement, GPA, and self-esteem are all significantly related to lower odds of running away from home. Having peers who drop out of school, going on more date nights, self-derogation, interpersonal aggression, sensation seeking, theft, and property damage, as well as past 12-month alcohol use, past 12-month marijuana use, and past 30-day cigarette use were all associated with higher odds of running away from home. Annual prevalence of running away from home has been decreasing, but still affects a large number of teens.

The influence of sexual violence on suicide risk among runaway youth in South Korea: The multiple additive moderating effect of peer attachment and parental attachment,"Kim, DH; Yop, KJ; Han, KJ","Background: Runaway youth without an adequate and safe place are vulnerable to sexual violence. Sexual violence is strongly associated with suicide risk, but peers and family are important factors in attenuating the negative outcomes of sexual violence; however, research on this relationship is insufficient because previous studies have focused only on runaway youth's problematic behavior. Objective: This study's specific aims were as follows: 1) to verify the association between sexual violence and suicide risk among runaway youth, and 2) to assess whether peer and parental attachment moderated the association between sexual violence and suicide risk among runaway youth. Participants and setting: The participants comprised 232 runaway youth (51.3 % girls); more than half were aged 17-19 years and approximately two-thirds of them had experienced child abuse. Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were provided to the participating runaway youth in youth shelters in South Korea. The data were analyzed using a multiple additive moderating model that simultaneously included moderating and control variables. Results: In total, 18.5 % of runaway youth were exposed to sexual violence (10.6 % boys, 26.1 % girls). Sexual violence victimization affected suicide risk among runaway youth. Peer attachment alleviated the negative relationship between sexual violence and suicide risk, and acted as a protective factor. Although the moderating effect of parental attachment was not significant, it significantly influenced suicide risk. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that runaway youth are vulnerable to sexual violence victimization, especially severe types of sexual violence. Our study verified the role of peer and parental attachment in the association between sexual violence and suicide risk among runaway youth. These findings suggest the need to improve positive peer and parent relationships to mitigate suicide risk among runaway youth.",2024,,CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT,149,,,WOS:001179451900001,10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.106665,,#3031,Kim 2024,,
"A qualitative exploration of substance misuse among homeless women in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Haile, K; Umer, H; Ayano, G; Fejo, E; Fanta, T","BackgroundSubstance use among homeless people is higher compared to the general population. In some studies, reported rates of problematic drug use among the homeless vary, with estimates ranging from 25 to 70%. There is a common perception that substance abuse and homelessness are linked, but there is considerable debate about the direction of the relationship. Despite observations of high levels of substance use among the homeless population in Addis Ababa, there are limited studies to date conducted on the topic. This study aims to explore the factors associated with onset of substance use and its continued use, patterns of substance use and its social and health consequences among female residents of a shelter in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted in 2019. In-depth interviews were conducted on 14 study participants who were selected purposively.

"Overdose Risk and Acquiring Opioids for Nonmedical Use Exclusively from Physicians in Vancouver, Canada","Cheng, T; Small, W; Nosova, E; Hogg, R; Hayashi, K; Kerr, T; DeBeck, K","Background:A primary response to the alarming rise in overdose and mortality due to nonmedical prescription opioid (PO) use has been to restrict opioid prescribing; however, little is known about the relationship between obtaining opioids from a physician and overdose risk among people who use POs nonmedically and illicit street drugs.Objectives:Investigate the relationship between non-fatal overdose and acquiring POs exclusively from physicians for the purposes of engaging in nonmedical PO use.Methods:Data were collected between 2013 and 2016 among participants in two harmonized prospective cohort studies of people who use drugs in Vancouver: the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) and the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS). Analyses were restricted to participants who engaged in nonmedical PO use and used generalized estimating equations.Results:Among 599 participants who used POs nonmedically, 82 (14%) individuals reported acquiring POs exclusively from a physician and 197 (33%) experienced a non-fatal overdose at some point over the study period. Acquiring POs exclusively from physicians was significantly and negatively associated with non-fatal overdose in the bivariate analysis (Odds Ratio = 0.60, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.39-0.94) but not the final multivariate analysis (Adjusted Odds Ratio =0.87, 95% CI: 0.53-1.44).Conclusions:Compared to individuals who acquired POs from friends or the streets, participants who acquired POs exclusively from a physician were not at an increased risk of non-fatal overdose.

"Associations between housing stability and injecting frequency fluctuations: findings from a cohort of people who inject drugs in Montreal, Canada","Fortier, E; Sylvestre, MP; Artenie, AA; Minoyan, N; Jutras-Aswad, D; Roy, E; Grebely, J; Bruneau, J","Background: The relationship between housing stability and drug injecting is complex, as both outcomes fluctuate over time. The objectives were to identify short-term trajectories of housing stability and injecting frequency among people who inject drugs (PWID) and examine how patterns of injecting frequency relate to those of housing stability.Methods: At three-month intervals, PWID enrolled between 2011 and 2016 in the Hepatitis Cohort completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire and were tested for hepatitis C and HIV infections. At each visit, participants reported, for each of the past three months, the accommodation they lived in the longest (stable/ unstable) and the number of injecting days (0-30). Group-based dual trajectory modeling was conducted to identify housing stability and injecting frequency trajectories evolving concomitantly over 12 months and estimate the probabilities of following injecting trajectories conditional upon housing trajectories.Results: 386 participants were included (mean age 40.0, 82 % male). Three housing stability trajectories were identified: sustained (53 %), declining (20 %), and improving (27 %). Five injecting frequency trajectories were identified: sporadic (26 %), infrequent (34 %), increasing (15 %), decreasing (11 %), and frequent (13 %). PWID with improving housing were less likely to increase injecting (8 %) compared to those with sustained (17 %) or declining housing (17 %).Conclusions: Improving housing was associated with a lower probability of increasing injecting compared to declining housing, while sustained housing stability was associated with a higher probability of increasing injecting compared to improving housing. Therefore, policies to improve PWID's access to stable housing are warranted and may reduce, to some extent, drug injecting and related harms.",2020,,DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE,206,,,WOS:000510804600018,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107744,,#3034,Fortier 2020,,
Prevalence and Correlates of Sexual Violence Experienced by Young Adult Black Men Who Have Sex with Men,"Siconolfi, D; Storholm, ED; Vincent, W; Pollack, L; Rebchook, GM; Huebner, DM; Peterson, JL; Kegeles, SM","Men who have sex with men (MSM) experience high prevalence of sexual violence (SV), and SV has well-documented effects on health. Research gaps are especially evident for young Black MSM (YBMSM), who experience significant HIV disparities and syndemics, including multiple forms of violence victimization. We examined lifetime prevalence of SV (having been forced or frightened into sexual activity) in a cross-sectional sample of YBMSM (N = 1732), and tested associations of demographic, psychosocial, and structural factors using multivariable regression. YBMSM were recruited between 2013 and 2015 using modified venue-based time-location sampling (e.g., at bars and clubs) in Dallas and Houston, Texas. Approximately 17% of YBMSM experienced any SV in their lifetimes. SV was associated with high school non-completion (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.15-2.77), lower psychological resilience (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71-0.98), lifetime history of homelessness (OR 5.52; 95% CI 3.80-8.02), recent financial hardship (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.48-3.14), and recent transactional sex (OR 3.87; 95% CI 2.43-6.15). We also examined differences by age of SV onset (childhood versus adulthood). YBMSM with adolescent/emerging adult-onset SV may have been more ambivalent in reporting lifetime SV experience, compared to men with childhood-onset SV, and correlates differed by age of onset. Childhood-onset SV was associated with high school non-completion, lower levels of psychological resilience, history of homelessness, recent financial hardship, and recent transactional sex. Adolescent/emerging adult-onset SV was associated with greater depressive symptoms, history of homelessness, and recent financial hardship.

"Initiating Persons into Injection Drug Use in Rural West Virginia, USA","White, RH; O'Rourke, A; Bluthenthal, RN; Kral, AH; Kilkenny, ME; Hazelett, TD; Sherman, SG; Allen, ST","Background: While prior research has explored factors associated with people who inject drugs (PWID) initiating others into drug injection in urban settings, very little work has been done to understand this behavior among rural PWID in Appalachia. Objectives: We aim to identify factors associated with PWID initiating injection-na?ve individuals into drug injection in a rural community in West Virginia (WV). Methods: Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey of 420 rural PWID (163 women) in Cabell County, WV in June-July 2018 who indicated recent (past 6?months) injection drug use. Individuals completed a survey that included measures on socio-demographics and injection socialization behaviors. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with PWID recently initiating someone for their first injection. Results: A minority (17%) reported recently initiating someone for their first injection. In multivariable regression, recent injection initiation was independently associated with number of injections per day (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.07,1.25), recent injection in front of an injection-na?ve person (aOR 2.75; 95% CI: 1.25,6.04), recent describing how to inject drugs to an injection-na?ve person (aOR 5.83; 95% CI: 2.71,12.57), and recent encouragement of an injection-na?ve person to inject (aOR 7.13; 95% CI: 2.31,21.87). Conclusion: Injection initiation was independently associated with several injection socialization behaviors involving injection-na?ve individuals. PWID who recently initiated injection-na?ve individuals had higher odds of frequent injection. Educating rural PWID about how their behaviors can influence others and the importance of engaging in safe injection practices could carry significant public health utility.",2020,,SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE,55,2,337-344,WOS:000489986500001,10.1080/10826084.2019.1669660,,#3036,White 2020,,
Interventions to improve children's access to mental health care: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Werlen, L; Gjukaj, D; Mohler-Kuo, M; Puhan, MA","Aims. Mental disorders in children are a significant and growing cause of morbidity worldwide. Although interventions to help overcome barriers along the pathway to accessing health care for children with mental disorders exist, there is no overview of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on these interventions as yet. This study aimed to systematically identify RCTs of interventions to improve access to mental health care for children and synthesise them using a conceptual framework of access to health care.Methods. This systematic review was performed following a predefined protocol registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018081714). We searched the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL for RCTs up to 15 May 2019 using terms related to the concepts 'young people,' 'mental disorders' and 'help-seeking interventions' and scanned reference lists from relevant studies. Two reviewers independently screened all identified articles in a two-stage process, extracted results on outcomes of interest (knowledge, attitudes, intentions, help-seeking, accessing care, mental health outcomes and satisfaction), assessed the risk of bias and conducted meta-analyses where deemed appropriate.Results. After screening 5641 identified articles, 34 RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Eighty per cent of universal school-based interventions measuring knowledge (n = 5) and 67% measuring attitudes (n = 6) reported significantly better results compared with controls on those outcomes, whereas 20% measuring access to care (n = 5) and none measuring mental health outcomes (n = 7) did. In contrast, 71% of interventions targeting at-risk individuals (n = 21) reported better access to care compared with controls, while just 33% (n = 6) did for mental health outcomes. For satisfaction with care, this proportion was 80% (n = 5). Meta-analyses of interventions measuring initial appointment attendance yielded combined odds ratios of 3.11 (2.07-4.67) for appointment reminder interventions and 3.51 (2.02-6.11) for treatment engagement interventions. The outcomes for universal school-based interventions were heterogeneous and could not be summarised quantitatively through meta-analysis.Conclusions. To have a population-level effect on improving children's access to mental health care, two-stage interventions that identify those in need and then engage them in the health-care system may be necessary. We need more evidence on interventions to target contextual factors such as affordability and infrastructural barriers.",2020,,EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES,29,,,WOS:000585066900033,10.1017/S2045796019000544,,#3037,Werlen 2020,,
Co-production of health and social science research with vulnerable children and young people: A rapid review,"Erwin, J; Burns, L; Devalia, U; Witton, R; Shawe, J; Wheat, H; Axford, N; Doughty, J; Kaddour, S; Nelder, A; Brocklehurst, P; Boswell, S; Paisi, M","BackgroundThe term 'care-experienced' refers to anyone who is currently in care or has been in care at any stage in their life. A complex interplay of factors leads to care-experienced children and young people (CECYP) experiencing poorer oral health and access to dental care than their peers. A rapid review of the co-production of health and social care research with vulnerable children and young people (CYP) was carried out to inform the development of a co-produced research project exploring the oral health behaviours and access to dental services of CECYP. Here, 'co-production' refers to the involvement of CYP in the planning or conduct of research with explicit roles in which they generate ideas, evidence and research outputs.AimTo learn how to meaningfully involve vulnerable CYP in the co-production of health and social science research.ObjectivesTo identify: Different approaches to facilitating the engagement of vulnerable CYP in co-production of health and social science research; different activities carried out in such approaches, challenges to engaging vulnerable CYP in co-production of health and social science research and ways to overcome them and areas of best practice in relation to research co-production with vulnerable CYP.Search StrategyA rapid review of peer-reviewed articles was conducted in six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, SocINDEX, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science) and grey literature to identify studies that engaged vulnerable CYP in co-approaches to health and social research.Main ResultsOf 1394 documents identified in the search, 40 were included and analysed. A number of different approaches to co-production were used in the studies. The CYP was involved in a range of activities, chiefly the development of data collection tools, data collection and dissemination. Individual challenges for CYP and researchers, practical and institutional factors and ethical considerations impacted the success of co-production.Discussion and ConclusionCo-production of health and social science with vulnerable CYP presents challenges to researchers and CYP calling for all to demonstrate reflexivity and awareness of biases, strengths and limitations. Used appropriately and well, co-production offers benefits to researchers and CYP and can contribute to research that reflects the needs of vulnerable CYP. Adherence to the key principles of inclusion, safeguarding, respect and well-being facilitates this approach.Patient and Public ContributionMembers of our patient and public involvement and stakeholder groups contributed to the interpretation of the review findings. This manuscript was written together with a young care leaver, Skye Boswell, who is one of the authors.

We conducted a mixed methods study of young (age 18-26) hard drug users in St. Petersburg. Thirty-nine structured and 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted. No HIV cases and two HCV cases were detected among the PWID subsample (n=29). Amphetamine and other stimulants were common (70%), opioid use was rare and episodic. Consistent condom use was 10%. No PWID reported syringe-sharing, 51% reported other drug paraphernalia sharing. Most (89%) never or rarely communicated with older (30+) opiate users. A new cohort of drug users in St. Petersburg may have emerged, which is much safer in its injection practices compared to previous cohorts. However, risky sexual practices among this new cohort may expose them to the possibility of sexual transmission of HIV and widespread drug paraphernalia sharing to the HCV epidemic.

"Police Encounters and Experiences among Youths and Adults Who Use Drugs: Qualitative and Quantitative Findings of a Cross-Sectional Study in Victoria, British Columbia","Greer, A; Sorge, J; Sharpe, K; Bear, D; Macdonald, S","People who use drugs are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system in Canada; how they come to be in contact with this system is typically through encounters with police. Understanding the nature of encounters between people who use drugs and police is vital to developing interventions and policing practices that are appropriate, fair, and promote the well-being of this community. This study quantitatively and qualitatively examines police encounters from the perspectives of youths and adults who use drugs in Victoria, British Columbia. The results show divergent predictors of police encounters and perceptions of these encounters based on age cohort. Youths were more likely to report police encounters and were more likely to perceive these encounters as negative compared with the adult cohort. Among both age groups, unstable housing was a significant predictor of reporting a recent encounter with the police. Among adults only, opioid use was a significant predictor of negative encounters. The qualitative findings show that negative perceptions were largely due to police harassment, being labelled as a person who uses drugs, and interference with drug paraphernalia. These findings also show that mutual respect and relationships built over time contribute to more positive reports of encounters. There were also many reports of positive experiences despite legal interference. These results suggest that people who use drugs belong to a group that are labelled and discriminated against, but that relationship building between people who use drugs and police can have a positive impact. These results may inform local policing practices and cultures, which can promote the health and well-being of the community.Les consommateurs de drogues sont disproportionnellement representes dans le systeme penal canadien. Generalement, ils entrent en contact avec ce systeme par l'entremise de rencontres avec la police.

Les jeunes etaient plus susceptibles de rapporter des rencontres avec la police et de percevoir ces rencontres comme etant negatives compare au groupe d'adultes. Parmi les deux groupes d'age, un hebergement instable etait un predicteur important du rapport de rencontres avec la police. Parmi les adultes seulement, la consommation d'opioides etait un predicteur important de rencontres negatives. Les resultats qualitatifs demontrent que les perceptions negatives etaient surtout dues au harcelement par la police, au fait d'etre qualifie de consommateur de drogues et a l'interference avec les accessoires facilitant la consommation de drogues. Ces resultats montrent aussi que le respect mutuel et des relations etablies sur une longue periode de temps contribuent a des rapports de rencontres plus positives. De nombreuses rencontres positives avaient aussi ete rapportees malgre l'interference legale. Ces resultats suggerent que les personnes qui consomment des drogues font partie d'un groupe catalogue et discrimine, mais que la creation de relations entre les consommateurs de drogues et la police peut avoir un impact positif.

Standing between the elite and street fields: Young people from affluent communities dealing with drugs,"Berger, EJ","Sociology has a rich tradition studying 'elite' and 'street' social spaces, but rarely considers spaces between these fields and the social actors within them. This article fills that gap by examining the life stories of affluent Oslo youth engaged in illegal drug dealing. Participants had access to economic, social, and cultural capital in both elite and street social space. Making money in legitimate and illegitimate ways kept participants relatively marginal in both spaces. Having social networks among street-oriented peers and among elites facilitated drug dealing but also allowed them an exit from drug crimes when needed. They were educated and often employed, but also had high levels of drug and street cultural competence. This left them relatively estranged from their affluent background milieu leading to persistence in drug dealing. I argue that illegal drug markets among the affluent can be viewed as an in-between social space, that 'elite' or 'street' youth are likely best conceptualized as existing on a sociocultural spectrum between fields and provide a Bourdieusian framework to study social actors who stand between fields and the impact this may have on their lives.La sociologie a une riche tradition d'& eacute;tude de l'espace social << des & eacute;lites >> et de celui << de la rue >>, mais elle s'int & eacute;resse rarement aux espaces situ & eacute;s entre ces deux domaines et aux acteurs sociaux qui s'y trouvent. Cet article comble cette lacune en examinant les r & eacute;cits de vie de jeunes ais & eacute;s d'Oslo qui se livrent au trafic ill & eacute;gal de stup & eacute;fiants. Les participants avaient acc & egrave;s & agrave; un capital & eacute;conomique, social et culturel & agrave; la fois dans l'espace social de l'& eacute;lite et dans celui de la rue. En gagnant de l'argent & agrave; la fois par des voies l & eacute;gitimes et ill & eacute;gitimes, ils se retrouvaient dans une situation relativement marginale dans les deux espaces. Le fait de disposer de r & eacute;seaux sociaux parmi leurs pairs tourn & eacute;s vers la culture de la rue et parmi les & eacute;lites facilite le trafic de stup & eacute;fiants, mais leur permet & eacute;galement de sortir en cas de besoin de la criminalit & eacute; li & eacute;e & agrave; la drogue. Il s'agit de personnes instruites et qui ont souvent un emploi, mais qui poss & egrave;dent & eacute;galement un niveau & eacute;lev & eacute; de comp & eacute;tences en mati & egrave;re de stup & eacute;fiants et de culture de la rue. Elles sont donc relativement & eacute;loign & eacute;es de leur milieu d'origine ais & eacute;, ce qui les am & egrave;ne & agrave; persister dans le trafic de drogue. J'explique que les march & eacute;s ill & eacute;gaux de la drogue parmi les personnes ais & eacute;es peuvent & ecirc;tre consid & eacute;r & eacute;s comme un espace social interm & eacute;diaire, que les jeunes de << l'& eacute;lite >> ou de << la rue >> sont probablement mieux conceptualis & eacute;s comme existant sur un specter socioculturel entre divers domaines, et fournissent un cadre bourdieusien pour l'& eacute;tude des acteurs sociaux qui se trouvent entre divers domaines et de l'impact que cela peut avoir sur leur vie.La sociolog & iacute;a tiene una rica tradici & oacute;n en el estudio de los espacios sociales 'de la & eacute;lite' y 'de la calle', pero rara vez considera los espacios entre estos campos y los actores sociales que est & aacute;n en ellos. Este art & iacute;culo trata de cubrir ese vac & iacute;o analizando las historias de vida de j & oacute;venes adinerados de Oslo que est & aacute;n involucrados en el tr & aacute;fico ilegal de drogas. Los participantes tienen acceso al capital econ & oacute;mico, social y cultural tanto en el espacio social de la & eacute;lite como en el de la calle. El hecho de ganar dinero de manera leg & iacute;tima e ileg & iacute;tima hace que los participantes se encuentren en posiciones relativamente marginales en ambos espacios. Tener redes sociales entre iguales con orientaci & oacute;n hacia la calle y entre las & eacute;lites facilita el tr & aacute;fico de drogas, pero tambi & eacute;n les permite una salida de la criminalidad vinculada con las drogas en caso de necesidad. Son educados y a menudo empleados, pero tambi & eacute;n tienen altos niveles de competencia cultural callejera y en materia de drogas. Esto los sit & uacute;a relativamente alejados de su entorno de origen adinerado, lo que los lleva a persistir en el tr & aacute;fico de drogas. El art & iacute;culo sostiene que los mercados ilegales de drogas entre ricos pueden verse como un espacio social intermedio, que los j & oacute;venes de '& eacute;lite' o 'la calle' probablemente se conceptualicen mejor como existentes en un espectro sociocultural entre diferentes campos y, al mismo tiempo, brindan un marco bourdieusiano para estudiar a los actores sociales que se encuentran entre diferentes campos y el impacto que esto puede tener en sus vidas.",2024,,CURRENT SOCIOLOGY,,,,WOS:001339898800001,10.1177/00113921241289606,,#3041,Berger 2024,,

Method: Eighteen participants (9 gender-diverse residents and 9 staff members) were interviewed individually to understand their experience of and needs in these settings. Results: The major findings included: (a) Gender-diverse service recipients felt unsafe and vulnerable in these facilities. Sharing space in which to carry out occupations of vulnerability often triggered anxiety and PTSD. (b) Gender-diverse service recipients felt that staff members did not understand how cumulative trauma adversely affected participation in programmatic activities. (c) Staff members reported that their facilities did not provide formal training needed to understand and address the unique needs of gender-diverse residents. (d) Gender-diverse service recipients commonly sustained trauma throughout their lives that compromised their ability to attain desired daily life skills and adult occupational roles. Such ruptures in their knowledge base likely served to maintain their homelessness despite repeated shelter admissions and housing placements. Conclusion: Occupational therapists could provide essential intervention to a gender-diverse youth population, including assisting with the attainment of skills needed for apartment management, employment seeking, maintenance, and health management.",2024,,Open Journal of Occupational Therapy (OJOT),12,3,17-Jan,,10.15453/2168-6408.2230,,#3042,Gutman 2024,,

However, there is a lack of readily available cessation services for this population, which is highly mobile and can be challenging to engage in services. Aims: We describe the development of a smoking cessation text messaging intervention (TMI) for homeless youth who are interested in quitting smoking. Methods: Participants were 18–25 years old and recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth. Three focus groups (N = 18) were conducted with smokers to refine the TMI content, and a separate sample of smokers (N = 8) provided feedback on the TMI after using it for 1 week. Survey data assessed the TMI's acceptability and feasibility. Results: Participants generally rated the TMI as helpful and relevant, and nearly all had cell phone plans that included unlimited texting and were able to view TMI content with few difficulties. Qualitative feedback on strengths/limitations of the TMI in terms of content, tone, and delivery parameters was used to finalize the TMI for a future evaluation. Conclusions: Results suggest that a TMI is a feasible and acceptable option for young people experiencing homelessness who are interested in quitting smoking.",2020,,Journal of Smoking Cessation,15,1,35-43,,10.1017/jsc.2019.24,,#3047,Tucker 2020,,

A Quasi-Experimental Evaluation of the Lifelong Links Intervention for Reducing Homelessness amongst Care Leavers,"Sanders, Michael; Hirneis, Vanessa; Picker, Vanessa","Despite the fact that care leavers are at significantly higher risk of homelessness than their peers who have not experienced care, there is a paucity of information on evidence-based interventions to address this risk. Lifelong Links is a program developed and delivered by the Family Rights Group in England. The intervention aims to ensure that a child in care has a positive support network around them to help during their time in care and into adulthood. In this article, we analyse the outcomes of a quasi-experimental evaluation of the Lifelong Links program. Specifically, we make use of a combination of coarsened exact matching, and a triple-differences approach (or difference in difference in differences analysis). Results of our analyses show that Lifelong Links is associated with a reduction in the risk of becoming homeless for care leavers aged eighteen to twenty in the years following its implementation. Our most robust model showed a reduction of around 10 per cent in the risk of a young care leaver being deemed at risk of, or experiencing homelessness, suggesting that improving ties between young people in care and their birth families (and/or building other sources of support) could have beneficial impacts on housing outcomes into adulthood.",2024,,British Journal of Social Work,54,7,2899-2918,3123915323,10.1093/bjsw/bcae068,,#3051,Sanders 2024,,
"S11-2:; Reaching and recruiting young people experiencing homelessness for physical activity interventions: Challenges, opportunities, and recommendations","Thomas, Jennifer; Crone, Diane; Bowes, Nicola; Thirlaway, Katie; Meyers, Robert W; Mackintosh, Kelly A","Purpose There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that physical activity-based interventions may be effective for engagement, psychological outcomes, and behaviour change of young people experiencing homelessness (YPEH). Nonetheless, challenges associated with reaching and recruiting this marginalised population are frequently reported owing to social isolation, lack of trust, and a high prevalence of poor mental health. This study sought to explore common barriers to recruitment, and identify potential strategies through which these may be overcome. Methods Three 8-week physical activity interventions were delivered to groups of between 4 and 12 YPEH. Following each intervention, qualitative data was collected through a series of interviews with implementers (sports coaches; n = 5) and support staff (n = 3), and three focus groups with participants (n = 17). Documented feedback, such as informal correspondence with staff, were used to provide further insights. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a mixed inductive/deductive thematic approach to identify multi-level challenges and opportunities, and comprehensively address the research aims. Results Multiple barriers and opportunities to the reach and recruitment of YPEH were identified across organisational, individual, and intervention levels. Challenges included limited staffing and organisational resources, negative experiences of participants, and sub-optimal intervention design and materials. Enablers included co-production with stakeholders, organisational staff champions, participant incentives, appropriate materials, and an active outreach recruitment strategy. Conclusions Overcoming challenges associated with reaching and recruiting marginalised groups for physical activity interventions requires consideration of multi-level barriers from the early stages of intervention development. While the enablers identified are concurrent with those reported across wider literature, future research should focus on how these can be embedded in a co-productive manner involving all stakeholders, throughout the research process.

S11; How to increase the reach of HEPA promotion among socially disadvantaged groups?,"Murphy, Niamh","Participation in physical activity (PA) has many benefits beyond improvements in physical health, like improved mental health, social connections, and certain skills. People from socially disadvantaged groups may benefit most from these outcomes, yet, programs that aim to increase physical activity participation among such groups often struggle with reaching and engaging adequate numbers of participants. This is unfortunate, because no matter how effective a program is for improving health and PA participation, its success and continuation is largely determined by its initial reach. In this symposium, chaired by Niamh Murphy from SETU Waterford in Ireland, we present recent insights obtained through research and practice into factors that affect the reach of physical activity interventions for various marginalized groups. Maike Till, Karim Abu-Omar, and Heiko Ziemainz from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany, discuss findings of the community-based participatory research project “BIG”, which explored how women in difficult life situations can best be reached and encouraged to participate in physical activity. The results showed, among others, that this may require distinct approaches for women in urban and rural areas.

It is part of a series that explores candid accounts of addiction and recovery to identify important components in the recovery process.Design/methodology/approachThe G-CHIME model comprises six elements important to addiction recovery (growth, connectedness, hope, identity, meaning in life and empowerment). It provides a standard against which to consider addiction recovery, having been used in this series, as well as in the design of interventions that improve well-being and strengthen recovery.

Longitudinal relationships between early-life homelessness and school-aged asthma and wheezing,"Keen, Ryan; Kim, Hannah Hayoung; Chen, Jarvis T; Tiemeier, Henning; Sandel, Megan T; Denckla, Christy; Slopen, Natalie","BackgroundHomelessness is a disruptive life event with profound impacts on children’s health. It remains unclear, however, whether homelessness in early life has an enduring association with asthma and wheezing among school-aged children.ObjectiveTo test whether early-life homelessness is prospectively associated with asthma and wheezing during school-aged years.MethodsWe draw on data from 9242 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Children were categorised as ‘ever’ or ‘never’ homeless based on maternal reports from the prenatal period through age 5 years. Children were assigned a binary indicator of asthma/wheezing based on maternal reports of asthma and wheezing at ages 6.8, 7.6 and 8.6 years. We used multilevel logistic regression models to test the association of interest in both bivariate analyses and models adjusted for a broad set of potential confounders. We conducted sensitivity analyses using generalised estimating equations and considering asthma and wheezing separately to test the robustness of the results.ResultsBetween 12.1% and 14.3% of children had asthma or wheezing at ages 6.8, 7.6 and 8.6 years, and these conditions were more common among ever homeless participants. Ever-homeless children displayed higher odds of asthma or wheezing than never-homeless children (OR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.48) after adjustment for child, maternal and household risk factors. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.ConclusionEarly-life homelessness is prospectively associated with asthma and wheezing among school-aged children and should be prioritised by interventions promoting healthy child development.",2024,,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,,,,3084594656,10.1136/jech-2024-222028,,#3060,Keen 2024,,
"The Multi-Modality Practitioner (MMP) approach: a technically eclectic, multimodal workforce innovation in the provision of support for individuals and families with multiple needs","Lidbetter, Nicky; Eaton, Emma; Cookson, Paul; Bell, Moira","PurposeThe aim of this paper is to describe and detail a new workforce initiative developed by a third sector organisation: the Multi-Modality Practitioner (MMP) approach, in the provision of support for individuals and families presenting in the community with multiple and varied needs.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a case study on a third sector organisation’s pioneering workforce initiative – the MMP approach.FindingsThe MMP approach has been developed as an alternative to existing approaches designed to address “single issues”, providing those working in the fields of health and social care and beyond, with a range of technically eclectic interventions from different modalities and approaches, to enable them to appropriately meet the needs of individuals and families presenting with multiple needs.Research limitations/implicationsThis case study is limited to providing a rationale for the development of the MMP approach and a description. It does not include any formal analysis as a future evaluative paper will report on an independent theory-based examination of the MMP approach via Theory of Change and Contribution Analysis methodologies.Practical implicationsThis case study describes the innovative role that the MMP approach as a workforce innovation plays in meeting multiple needs in the community when deployed as either a stand-alone approach, or one that can be integrated with existing community-based services including, but not limited to, mental health, employability, addiction, housing, homelessness, public health and child and family services.Social implicationsThe MMP approach constitutes a disruptive, pionneering, client-centred, workplace innovation that is trauma-informed, relational, strengths-based and continuity of care focused, capable of supporting individuals and families with multiple needs, negating onward referral and with potential to reduce demand on public services. It also provides those working in a range of health and social care roles with the opportunity to expand their therapeutic repertoire through high-quality, multi-skilled training in evidence-based and societally important, technically eclectic interventions drawn from a range of modalities.Originality/valuePluralistic practice and multimodal theories have been in existence for over two decades, the MMP approach however, whilst sharing some of these concepts and philosophies, differs in that it provides those trained in the approach with a ‘toolkit’ of interventions that are technically eclectic, drawn from a range of modalities and approaches and aimed at meeting multiple needs in a pragmatic and accessible manner. Furthermore, the Diploma in Multi-Modality Practice is the first training course of its kind available at postgraduate level.",2024,,Mental Health and Social Inclusion,28,3,188-194,3065506699,10.1108/MHSI-01-2023-0010,,#3061,Lidbetter 2024,,

This study examines alcohol outcomes from a 24-month evaluation of AWARE, a brief motivational interviewing-based group risk reduction intervention for emerging adults experiencing homelessness. Method: In a cluster randomized crossover trial, 18- to 25- year-olds received AWARE (n = 132) or standard care (n = 144) at one of three drop-in centers serving young people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County. We evaluated intervention effects on past month alcohol use, consequences, and related cognitions such as motivation to change behavior. Results: AWARE participants showed significant reductions over 24 months in alcohol use and negative consequences from drinking and reported significant increases in their use of drinking protective strategies. Except for drinking frequency, control group participants did not show a significant change in these outcomes.

Participants were 64 staff working in different family homeless shelters representing all 10 Housing and Urban Development regions. Data were collected via semistructured phone interviews. Results indicated that most shelters offered some type of parenting programme (65.5%) and had some developmentally appropriate space for families with young children (87.5%); however, the nature of these spaces and programmes varied considerably, with very few respondents describing use of evidence‐based practices.

Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic for Youth Housing and Homelessness Services: C & A,"Farnish, Krystan A.; Schoenfeld, Elizabeth A.","Youth homelessness is a growing crisis in the United States that is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. A variety of social service programs exist to address youth homelessness and its consequences, such as street outreach and diversion services, emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, and rapid rehousing services, among others. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached the United States in early 2020, altering nearly every facet of daily life, including the way social service organizations structure and deliver their programming. To understand the implications of the pandemic on housing and homelessness services for youth, the current study examines data from interviews conducted with staff from a large non-profit in Austin, Texas, serving vulnerable transition-age youth. Through these interviews, programmatic changes that occurred as a result of COVID-19—as well as challenges and facilitators to service delivery—were identified.

"Remote Parenting in Families Experiencing, or at Risk of, Homelessness: A Study Based on Grounded Theory","Reinhardt Andrade, Filipa Maria; Resende, Ana; Roquette-Viana, Maria Clara; Amélia Simões Figueiredo","The situation/risk of family homelessness presents multiple interrelated issues. It has considerable negative consequences, namely the deterioration of the family members’ health and well-being, and alterations in the family’s dynamics, with parents sometimes being separated from their children. The aim of this research was to understand how parenting takes place in families experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness. The conducted study falls within the qualitative paradigm, using Strauss and Corbin’s version of the Grounded Theory methodology. Three main categories emerged, supported by all the participating families: “Meaning of Parenthood”, “Key Events”, and “Transition Circumstances”. These categories were translated into facilitating/inhibiting factors, within the following dimensions: “Individual”, “Family”, and “Society”. We were able to conclude that, in the population under study, parenting is restricted, being mostly exerted in a remote manner. Furthermore, it takes on different forms, depending on the specific homelessness situation/risk. In families at risk of homelessness, we identified “Remote Parenting with Maintained Parental Authority”, as well as “Restricted Parenting”, when the children still lived with their parents. On the other hand, in families experiencing homelessness, we identified “Remote Parenting with Maintained Parental Authority”, “Unilateral Remote Parenting”, “Interrupted Parenting”, and the “Total Disruption of Parenting”.",2024,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,21,9,1184,3110483308,10.3390/ijerph21091184,,#3068,ReinhardtAndrade 2024,,
Coproduction of accessible digital mental health supports in partnership with young people from marginalised backgrounds: a scoping review protocol,"Kealy, Carmen; Potts, Courtney; Mulvenna, Maurice D; Donohoe, Gary; O'Neill, Siobhan; Barry, Margaret M","IntroductionDespite the evidence supporting the value of digital supports for enhancing youth mental health services, there is a lack of guidance on how best to engage with young people in coproduction processes during the design and evaluation of these technologies. User input is crucial in digital mental health, especially for disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised young people as they are often excluded from coproduction. A scoping review of international literature written in English will explore the coproduction processes with marginalised young people in digital mental health supports, from mental health promotion to targeted interventions. The review is guided by the research question: what are the most appropriate coproduction processes for engaging young people, especially marginalised young people, in the different stages of designing and evaluating digital mental health supports? The review aims to map and summarise the evidence, inform the overall research project and address the knowledge gaps.Methods and analysisThe scoping review uses Arksey and O’Malley’s framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews. From 22–24 October 2023, PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, ASSIA, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane database, Embase, Google Scholar, ProQuest, OAIster and BASE will be systematically searched. Papers from 2021 onwards with a range of study designs and evidence that illustrate engagement with marginalised young people (aged 16–25) in the design, implementation and evaluation of digital technologies for young people’s mental health will be considered for inclusion. At least two reviewers will screen full texts and chart data. The results of this review will be summarised quantitatively through numerical counts of included literature and qualitatively through a narrative synthesis.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval is not required.

“Death Is a Possibility for Those without Shelter”: A Thematic Analysis of News Coverage on Homelessness and the 2021 Heat Dome in Canada,"Tetzlaff, Emily J; Farah Mourad; Goulet, Nicholas; Gorman, Melissa; Siblock, Rachel; Kidd, Sean A; Bezgrebelna, Mariya; Kenny, Glen P","Among the most vulnerable to the health-harming effects of heat are people experiencing homelessness. However, during the 2021 Heat Dome, the deadliest extreme heat event (EHE) recorded in Canada to date, people experiencing homelessness represented the smallest proportion of decedents (n = 3, 0.5%)—despite the impacted region (British Columbia) having some of the highest rates of homelessness in the country. Thus, we sought to explore the 2021 Heat Dome as a media-based case study to identify potential actions or targeted strategies that were initiated by community support agencies, individuals and groups, and communicated in the news during this EHE that may have aided in the protection of this group or helped minimize the mortality impacts. Using media articles collated for a more extensive investigation into the effects of the 2021 Heat Dome (n = 2909), we identified a subset which included content on people experiencing homelessness in Canada (n = 274, 9%). These articles were thematically analysed using NVivo. Three main themes were identified: (i) public warnings issued during the 2021 Heat Dome directly addressed people experiencing homelessness, (ii) community support services explicitly targeting this population were activated during the heat event, and (iii) challenges and barriers faced by people experiencing homelessness during extreme heat were communicated. These findings suggest that mass-media messaging and dedicated on-the-ground initiatives led by various organizations explicitly initiated to support individuals experiencing homelessness during the 2021 Heat Dome may have assisted in limiting the harmful impacts of the heat on this community.",2024,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,21,4,405,3046906527,10.3390/ijerph21040405,,#3070,Tetzlaff 2024,,
"Trends in Mental Wellbeing of US Children, 2019–2022: Erosion of Mental Health Continued in 2022","Bhandari, Neeraj; Gupta, Shivani","We provide fresh estimates of a change in the nationwide prevalence of mental health symptoms among US children during the COVID-19 pandemic using National Health Interview Survey data (2019–22) on children aged 2–17 years (n = 27,378; age subgroups 2–5, 6–11, and 12–17) to assess overall mental distress and 19 specific outcomes related to developmental, communicative, cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains. Raw and adjusted (for socio-demographics) linear regressions estimated the change in prevalence for each outcome between 2019 (baseline year) and three succeeding years (2020–2022). Summary scores for mental distress rose between 2019 and 2020 (1.01 to 1.18 points, range of 0–15), declined slightly in 2021 (1.09), and climbed sharply again in 2022 (1.25). The declines primarily affected adolescents (1.11 at baseline, 1.24 in 2020, 1.30 in 2021, and 1.49 in 2022). Specific outcomes belonging to all domains of mental health showed similar increases in prevalence.

Families with young children in homeless shelters: Developmental contexts of multisystem risks and resources,"Cutuli, J J; Herbers, Janette E; Vrabic, Sarah C; Baye, Omari","We apply a multisystem perspective to three aims relevant to resilience for young children in emergency and transitional homeless shelters. We consider profiles of risks and resources before shelter, early childhood program enrollment during shelter, and the likelihood of returning to shelter or having a subsequent child welfare placement. We used longitudinal, city-wide data from multiple sources integrated at the individual level across the lifespan for 8 birth cohorts. Young children (N = 1,281) stayed in family shelters during an 18-month period during a multisystem intervention. Risk factor rates were high as were rates of early childhood program enrollment (66.1% in any program; 42.3% in a high-quality program), which may suggest positive effects of the multisystem intervention. Multilevel latent class analysis revealed four profiles, considering prior shelter stays, prior child welfare placements, prior elevated lead levels, perinatal factors (teenage mother, prenatal care, low maternal education, and poor birth outcomes), demographics, and early childhood program enrollment and quality. One profile with higher rates of child welfare placement before the shelter stay and considerable enrollment in high-quality early childhood programs corresponded to lower rates of subsequent child welfare placement.

“The Propellers of My Life” The Impact of Domestic Violence Transitional Housing on Parents and Children: C & A,"Wood, Leila; McGiffert, Maggy; Fusco, Rachel A.; Kulkarni, Shanti","Housing and homelessness are frequent issues facing domestic violence (DV) survivors and their children. Several DV programs provide transitional housing (DVTH) to address the housing needs of DV survivors and their children. Despite wide use, little is known about the impact of DVTH, especially on child and parenting related needs and outcomes. Multiple structured interviews (82) were conducted with 27 parents with minor children living in DVTH in order to explore housing program experiences. Thematic analysis techniques produced three themes and seven subthemes about DVTH impact on parenting and child wellness. Overarching themes include: (1) DVTH helps to strengthen the parent–child relationship through a focus on family connection and health; (2). Transitional housing provides an opportunity for family stability via housing, material, and economic stability; (3). Time at DVTH allows family to access a diverse range of trauma-informed resources and social support to meet family goals. Barriers to these potential impacts are explored. Implications for practice with youth and parents include the need for extensive mental health and legal advocacy, programmatic models that emphasize resources, safety and the transition to permanent housing, and build on family strengths. Further research is needed to evaluate DVTH program outcomes.",2023,,Child & Adolescent Social Work Journal,40,6,883-897,2869789911,10.1007/s10560-021-00809-1,,#3074,Wood 2023,,
Firearm Injuries In Children And Adolescents: Health And Economic Consequences Among Survivors And Family Members,"Song, Žirui; Zubizarreta, José R; Giuriato, Mia; Koh, Katherine A; Sacks, Chana A","More US children and adolescents today die from firearms than any other cause, and many more sustain firearm injuries and survive.

However, studies investigating these issues in the context of homelessness and migration are rare. This research aimed to examine the relations of any breastfeeding duration with health outcomes among migrant mother–child dyads experiencing homelessness. Methods Data were collected among sheltered and mainly foreign-born mothers experiencing homelessness, and their children aged 6 months to 5 years, from the ENFAMS cross-sectional survey (n = 481, 2013—Great Paris area). Any breastfeeding duration, along with various health outcomes of both the mother and her child, was ascertained by face-to-face questionnaires administered by trained interviewers to mothers (perceived physical and emotional health and maternal depression) or by trained psychologists to children (adaptive behaviours). Nurses measured weight and height [thus allowing them to calculate body mass index (BMI)] and haemoglobin concentration (mother–child dyad) and maternal blood pressure. Multivariable linear and modified Poisson regression analyses were performed to examine outcome-wide associations between any breastfeeding duration ≥6 months and the various mother–child outcomes. Results Any breastfeeding ≥6 months was associated with lower systolic blood pressure in mothers (B = −0.40, 95% confidence interval = −0.68 to −0.12). No association was observed with the other outcomes. Conclusions The relevance of supporting breastfeeding to improve mothers’ physical health holds true in the context of migration and homelessness. It is therefore important to support breastfeeding in these settings. Moreover, given the documented social complexity of breastfeeding practices, interventions should take mothers’ socio-cultural heritage and the structural barriers they face into account.",2023,,European Journal of Public Health,33,5,796-802,3050610528,10.1093/eurpub/ckad096,,#3077,Descarpentrie 2023,,
Looked after children in prison as adults: life adversity and neurodisability,"Hope, Kent; Kirby, Amanda; Leckie, George; Cornish, Rosie; Hogarth, Lee; Williams, W Huw","PurposeLooked after children (LAC) are criminalised at five times the rate of children in the general population. Children in contact with both child welfare and child justice systems have higher rates of neurodisability and substance use problems, and LAC in general have high rates of school exclusion, homelessness and unemployment. This study aims to understand whether these factors persist in LAC who are in prison as adults.Design/methodology/approachAdministrative data collected by the Do-IT profiler screening tool in a prison in Wales, UK, were analysed to compare sentenced prisoners who were LAC (n = 631) to sentenced prisoners who were not LAC (n = 2,201). The sample comprised all prisoners who were screened on entry to prison in a two-year period.FindingsPrisoners who were LAC scored more poorly on a functional screener for neurodisability (effect size = 0.24), and on four self-report measures capturing traits of dyslexia (0.22), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (0.40), autism spectrum disorders (0.34) and developmental co-ordination disorder (0.33). Prisoners who were LAC were more likely to have been to a pupil referral unit (0.24), have substance use problems (0.16), be homeless or marginally housed (0.18) and be unemployed or unable to work due to disability (0.13).Originality/valueThis study uniquely contributes to our understanding of prisoners who were LAC as a target group for intervention and support with re-integration into the community upon release. LAC in prison as adults may require additional interventions to help with employment, housing and substance use.

Mental Health Service Experiences Among Transition-Age Youth: Interpersonal Continuums that Influence Engagement in Care: C & A,"McCormick, Katie A.; Chatham, Ana; Klodnick, Vanessa V.; Schoenfeld, Elizabeth A.; Cohen, Deborah A.","Purpose. Transition-age youth (TAY) who have experienced or are experiencing complex trauma, system involvement and homelessness are at increased risk for serious mental health needs and related challenges. However, these vulnerable and historically marginalized TAY typically have low rates of mental health service engagement. This study examines how and why TAY experiencing system involvement, homelessness, and serious mental health and substance use symptoms engage in mental health services, and what facilitates and/or hinders their engagement in services. Methods. Twenty-one TAY completed a virtual interview about their previous and current mental health service experiences, and why they did or did not engage with mental health services. A modified grounded theory qualitative analysis approach was used to understand how participants’ personal sense of meaning interacted with programmatic factors to construct participant experiences with mental health services. Results. Most participants (81%, n = 17) received mental health services, namely psychiatry (76%, n = 16) and counseling/therapy (48%, n = 10), and peer support (10%, n = 2). Participants described their mental health service experiences along three interpersonal and relational continuums between themselves and their providers: feeling (mis)understood, being treated with (dis)respect, and experiencing (dis)trust. Discussion. Study findings reveal that for these particularly vulnerable and marginalized TAY, relational and interpersonal factors significantly influenced their engagement in mental health services. Study findings call for providers to re-imagine their working alliance with highly vulnerable TAY through culturally-attuned practices that promote understanding, respect, and trust. Findings also call for TAY-serving programs and policies to re-imagine peer support as a mental health service option for this highly vulnerable population.",2023,,Child & Adolescent Social Work Journal,40,4,525-536,2837221348,10.1007/s10560-022-00890-0,,#3079,McCormick 2023,,

Early Intervention for Families Experiencing Homelessness: A Pilot Randomized Trial Comparing Two Parenting Programs,"Graziano, Paulo A; Spiegel, Jamie A; Hayes, Timothy; Arcia, Emily","Objective: As part of a larger community-based, service-driven research project, the primary purpose of this pilot randomized study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering time-limited adaptations of parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT) and child–parent psychotherapy (CPP) within a sample of children experiencing homelessness. The secondary goal was to examine the promise of both interventions in improving parent/child outcomes. Method: One hundred forty-four young children (18 month–5 years old; Mage = 3.48, SD = 1.09; 43.1% female; 78.5% Black/African American; 27.1% Hispanic) and their mothers were recruited from a women's homeless shelter and randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either PCIT or CPP delivered by shelter clinicians on-site. Attendance, fidelity, and program satisfaction were obtained. Families completed pre- and postintervention assessments, including observational data on maternal verbalizations during a child-led play session. Results: Both time-limited PCIT and time-limited CPP were successfully implemented with similarly high levels of intervention fidelity (>90%) and satisfaction by mothers (85%). Completion rates were similar across both time-limited PCIT (76.6%) and time-limited CPP (71.4%). Both time-limited CPP and PCIT resulted in decreases in children's posttraumatic stress, parental stress, and increases in maternal positive verbalizations. Only time-limited PCIT resulted in significant improvements in externalizing behavior problems in children and reductions in maternal negative verbalizations.

Longitudinal patterns of childhood homelessness and early adolescent trajectories of internalising and externalising behaviour,"Kim, Hannah Hayoung; Keen, Ryan; Tang, Alva; Denckla, Christy; Slopen, Natalie","BackgroundChild homelessness has been associated with elevated mental health problems during early adolescence, a period of onset for psychiatric problems. Prior literature has relied on cross-sectional studies, limiting the understanding of temporality and trajectories of psychopathology. We extend prior literature by examining associations between child homelessness and internalising and externalising symptom trajectories in early adolescence, with consideration of timing and persistence of homelessness.MethodsUsing population-based longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we used multilevel models to examine the effects of homelessness prior to age 9, the timing of homelessness (eg, early vs middle childhood) and cumulative exposure to homelessness on internalising and externalising trajectories across ages <0–9 years. We also tested for sex differences in these associations.ResultsOf the 8391 participants, 5.5% reported exposure to homelessness at least once before age 9. Children who experienced homelessness had elevated internalising and externalising symptoms compared with their consistently housed peers, with excess risk evident among children who first experienced homelessness in middle childhood (relative to early childhood) and children who experienced recurrent homelessness. We did not observe changes in symptom trajectories over the course of 4 years. Men who experienced homelessness displayed a more pronounced risk of internalising symptoms relative to women and men who did not experience homelessness.ConclusionChildhood homelessness is associated with persistently elevated internalising and externalising symptoms across early adolescence compared with their consistently housed peers.

The impact of community engagement as a public health intervention to support the mental well-being of single mothers and children living under housing insecure conditions – a rapid literature review,"Joseph, Natasha; Burn, Anne-Marie; Anderson, Joanna","BackgroundIn the UK, the population of homelessness and housing insecurity is increasing among families headed by mothers. The unique stressors of housing insecurity and living in accommodations ill-suited to long-term dwellings increase mental distress for mothers and children. Community engagement interventions present a public health opportunity to alleviate adverse outcomes for vulnerable families.AimTo synthesise and evaluate evidence of the impact of community engagement interventions in supporting the mental well-being of mothers and children living under housing insecure conditions. To synthesise the components of community engagement interventions as a public health intervention in alleviating mental well-being and non-health outcomes of mothers and children living under housing insecurity.MethodsA systematic search of five online bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health and Child Development & Adolescent Studies) and grey literature (Carrot2) was conducted in May 2022. Primary studies with community engagement components and housing-insecure single-mother families were included. Intervention data was extracted using the TIDieR checklist and a community engagement keywording tool. The studies’ quality was critically appraised using the MetaQAT framework.ResultsTen studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified, across two countries (USA & UK). Data from the studies reported positive significant effects for health and personal maternal outcomes in addition to higher positive effects for child health outcomes (e.g., decrease in depression symptoms). Interventions targeting social support and self-efficacy demonstrated potential to improve maternal and child outcomes via the maternal-child relationship. Community engagement at the design, delivery and evaluation intervention stages increased the level of community engagement, however there were tentative links to directly improving mental well-being outcomes.ConclusionThere is evidence to suggest that community engagement may be applied as an effective intervention in supporting the mental well-being of mothers and children living under housing insecurity. Proposed intervention effectiveness may be achieved via psychosocial pathways such as improved maternal self-efficacy and social support. However, more embedded long-term process evaluations of these interventions are needed to establish maintenance of these observed benefits and to understand to what extent the findings apply to the UK context.",2023,,BMC Public Health,23,,26-Jan,2877494013,10.1186/s12889-023-16668-7,,#3088,Joseph 2023,,

Mothers' perceptions of how homelessness and housing interventions affect their children's behavioral and educational functioning,"Brown, Scott R; Thurber, Amie; Shinn, Marybeth","Children who experience homelessness display substantial variation in outcomes, but little attention has been given to potential mechanisms linking their housing experiences to their functioning. This study explores these mechanisms using qualitative coding of 80 interviews with parents participating in a randomized control trial of housing interventions for families experiencing homelessness. Interviews were conducted an average of 7 months after families entered a homeless shelter, when most families had exited shelters to a variety of other housing options. Many parents described children as faring poorly on behavioral and educational outcomes while in shelters but displaying improvement after leaving the shelter. Parents commonly viewed shelters as contributing to behavioral disruptions, with restored autonomy and routines after exiting shelters contributing to recovery in functioning. Parents offered long-term rental subsidies viewed having a stable, adequate place of their own as helping their children fare better from reduced family stress, improved routines, and changes in children's expectations about stability. Findings indicate the importance of understanding differences in housing stability and quality among families who experience homelessness for how children fare-including differences in how housing interventions affect stability and quality.

Interventions addressing maternal and child health among the urban poor and homeless: an overview of systematic reviews,"Nambiar, Devaki; Mathew, Bincy; Dubey, Shubhankar; Moola, Sandeep","BackgroundInequalities in access to and utilization of maternal and child health (MCH) care are hampering progress on the path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In a number of Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) population subgroups at disproportionate risk of being left behind are the urban poor. Within this neglected group is the further neglected group of the homeless. Concomitantly, a number of interventions from the antenatal period onward have been piloted, tested, and scaled in these contexts. We carried out an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) to characterize the evidence around maternal and child health interventions relevant to urban poor homeless populations in LMICs.MethodsWe searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Health Systems Evidence and EBSCOhost databases for SRs published between January 2009 and 2020 (with an updated search through November 2021). Our population of interest was women or children from urban poor settings in LMICs; interventions and outcomes corresponded with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance document. Each SR was assessed by two reviewers using established standard critical appraisal checklists. The overview was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021229107).ResultsIn a sample of 33 high quality SRs, we found no direct relevant evidence for pregnant and lactating homeless women (and children) in the reviewed literature. There was a lack of emphasis on evidence related to family planning, safe abortion care, and postpartum care of mothers. There was mixed quality evidence that the range of nutritional interventions had little, unclear or no effect on several child mortality and development outcomes. Interventions related to water, sanitation, and hygiene, ensuring acceptability of community health services and health promotion type programs could be regarded as beneficial, although location seemed to matter. Importantly, the risk of bias reporting in different reviews did not match, suggesting that greater attention to rigour in their conduct is needed.ConclusionThe generalizability of existing systematic reviews to our population of interest was poor. There is a clear need for rigorous primary research on MCH interventions among urban poor, and particularly homeless populations in LMICs, as it is as yet unclear whether the same, augmented, or altogether different interventions would be required.",2023,,BMC Public Health,23,,11-Jan,2788466733,10.1186/s12889-023-15410-7,,#3092,Nambiar 2023,,

Objectives: The present study aimed to identify sociodemographic characteristics, type of used drug, and risky behaviors associated with ED use and hospitalization among patients with SRD. Methods: Studies in English published from January 1st, 1995 to April 30th, 2022 were searched from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify primary studies on ED use and hospitalization among patients with SRD. Results: Of the 17,348 outputs found, a total of 39 studies met the eligibility criteria. Higher ED use and hospitalization among patients with SRD were associated with a history of homelessness (ED use: OR = 1.93, 95%CI = 1.32–2.83; hospitalization: OR = 1.53, 95%CI = 1.36–1.73) or of injection drug use (ED use: OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.13–1.59; hospitalization: OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.20–1.69).

How might changes to family income affect the likelihood of children being in out-of-home care? Evidence from a realist and qualitative rapid evidence assessment of interventions,"Wood, S; Scourfield, J; Stabler, L; Addis, S; Wilkins, D; Forrester, D; Brand, SL","Interventions that change family income include any policy or practice that directly or indirectly changes the amount of money a family have. Although theory regarding the relationship between poverty and child maltreatment is well established, theories of how family income change affects the likelihood of children being in out-of-home are not well developed. This realist rapid evidence assessment provides an overview of the process of how interventions that change family income affect the rate of children in out-of-home care. The study population is families at risk of their children entering care and families whose children are in care and are pursuing reunification. Ten studies were identified from an earlier scoping review. Intervention effect results are described and qualitative evidence about mechanisms and moderators is presented as an initial ""programme theory"". The review makes an initial suggestion of four pathways through which a change in family income can alter the risk of child abuse and neglect and thus affect the rate of children in out-of-home care. These are: 1) the impact of employment; 2) changes to the home environment; 3) risk/prevention of homelessness; 4) building trusting relationships with social workers. National or local policies which increase a family's income, for instance through tax and benefits regimes or the provision of free childcare, could potentially reduce the rate of children in out-of-home care. There is also a role for social workers in providing direct material help to families. More work is needed to develop intervention theories and better understanding of the process of using material resources to help families at risk of their children being in out-of-home care.",2022,,Children and Youth Services Review,143,,1,2771383614,10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106685,,#3094,Wood 2022,,

Our community-engaged, mixed-methods research project sought to identify barriers to TANF among families with young children in Illinois. In this study we analyzed TANF sanctions related to child support enforcement, using analysis of TANF administrative data and semistructured interviews with TANF customers. We conducted logistic regression and Fisher's test to explore demographic differences in sanctioning and sanction types. Black families were 111 percent more likely than White families to receive at least one sanction in 2018-19.

Understanding Pandemic Experiences Among America's Elders,"Aronson, Louise; Kotwal, Ashwin","On a Saturday in late February 2020,Washington State announced the first large US COVID-19 outbreak, which, surprising no one who had been following the pandemic in other countries, occurred in a skilled nursing facility. Although the media and public expressed horror at the stretchers and body bags being wheeled out of the care home, many also accepted such outcomes as inevitable. ""Well, of course,"" the thinking was, ""they were so old, so frail, so ill.""In the weeks that followed, we awaited our country's official response with equal parts dread and hope. As geriatricians, we had closely followed the stories about infected old people in China locked in their homes and elderly Spaniards abandoned to die in care facilities. We wanted the United States to do better. To be better. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised older adults especially to stock up on food and for everyone to adopt social distancing practices to protect the vulnerable elderly, we hoped that such measures signaled recognition that a potentially preventable virus was killing old people and that old people were worth helping.In the US, for those of us thousands of miles from the growing outbreaks in large East Coast cities, the early weeks of lockdown engendered a mix of exhilaration and trepidation. Among the privileged, social distancing became essentially a series of snow days-a chance to staycation with family, read, sleep, stream, and exercise. Others went to work, producing food or health care, risking their lives by choice, necessity, or both. The least fortunate wondered how long their money and food would last before they fell into homelessness, hunger, and despair. From the start there were people who questioned social distancing. Some young people labeled the virus ""boomer remover,"" as if it were a tool of social justice, and some more advantaged old people flouted the recommended precautions, going about their lives as if nothing had changed.What we have learned in the years of caring for patients in our geriatrics and palliative care clinics during the pandemic is that the experiences of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, as during the decades of old age itself, have not been homogenous. Yet for many, particularly for certain populations- people who entered the pandemic socially isolated, those with a history of depression and anxiety, and residents of nursing homes-the nature and duration of pandemic isolation made already difficult situations significantly worse.",2022,,Health Affairs,41,12,1827-1831,2747035426,,,#3096,Aronson 2022,,
Willing but Unable: How Resources Help Low-Income Mothers Care for their Children and Minimise Child Protection Interventions,"Kuskoff, Ella; Parsell, Cameron; Plage, Stefanie; Ablaza, Christine; Perales, Francisco","Low-income mothers face disproportionately high risks of engaging with statutory child protection systems. Whilst this is often perceived as a result of poor or irresponsible parenting practices, an increasing body of scholarship foregrounds the role of structural issues—such as poverty and homelessness—that constrain mothers’ agency and impact their ability to care for their children. In this article, we examine Australia’s first permanent Supportive Housing for Families (SHF) programme, which offers low-income mothers practical resources to minimise the risk of statutory child protection intervention. Our research aims to understand low-income mothers’ willingness and ability to care for their children, and how mothers engaged with and made meaning of their experiences residing in SHF. Using a qualitative research design, we analyse interview data with programme mothers (n = 17), programme support workers (n = 10) and statutory child protection officers (n = 7). We find that the resources provided through the programme enabled mothers to care for their children in ways that aligned with their parenting beliefs and aspirations. We conclude that SHF programmes may be an effective means through which low-income mothers can overcome the structural barriers that keep them engaged with statutory child protection systems.",2022,,British Journal of Social Work,52,7,3982-3998,3123915344,10.1093/bjsw/bcac027,,#3097,Kuskoff 2022,,

Characteristics Associated with Housing Loss Among Youth in a Rapid Rehousing Program: C & A,"Youngbloom, Amy J.; Farnish, Krystan A.; Schoenfeld, Elizabeth A.","Housing First programs, such as rapid rehousing, are a well-established approach to addressing homelessness among adults, yet there remains a lack of research demonstrating the ability of such services to effectively promote housing stability among youth. Given the paucity of work examining the factors associated with housing stability for formerly homeless youth, the current exploratory study was conducted to determine the characteristics associated with housing loss (i.e., due to evictions or notices to vacate) among youth (N = 60) housed through a rapid rehousing program. Data collected through service delivery at an agency in Austin, Texas, were examined as part of this analysis, including sociodemographic information, mental health and substance misuse, and other background and psychosocial factors. Stepwise regression analyses revealed significant positive associations between youth’s loss of housing and the following three factors: (1) foster care history; (2) identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ); and (3) depression. Results from this study highlight the need for more tailored support for youth who have a history of foster care involvement, identify as LGBTQ, or are experiencing depression as they exit homelessness through a rapid rehousing program.

Allocating Homeless Services After the Withdrawal of the Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool,"Shinn, Marybeth, PhD; Richard, Molly K, MS","Until there are sufficient resources to end homelessness in the United States, communities will struggle with how to allocate limited homeless services. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires communities to establish a coordinated assessment system using a standardized tool to prioritize services.1 Until recently, the most widely used tool was the VI-SPDAT (Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool) for single adults or a modification for youths and families.2 The tool assesses individuals' level of vulnerability across their history of housing and homelessness, individual risk factors, socialization and daily functions, and wellness. It then prioritizes people with the highest scores for permanent supportive housing, those with intermediate scores for short-term, rapid-rehousing subsidies, and those with the lowest scores for minimal services. Typically, use of the VI-SPDAT conflates risk assessment with allocation of services, where only the vulnerability score is used to match people to housing and services. The tool has been criticized as invalid and unreliable3 and racially biased,4 but also defended as predicting returns to homelessness.5 There is little justification for the cutoffs between recommended housing options (although, frequently, communities lack sufficient resources to follow these recommendations). Ultimately, widespread concerns led the VI-SPDAT's creators to stop supporting its use.2 This change requires communities to confront both empirical and ethical questions that the availability and near field-wide adoption of a tool, however flawed, allowed them to avoid. To aid communities as they confront these questions, we discuss three issues central to the design of a coordinated assessment processes: risk assessment (what should count as risk?), prioritization (who should get services first?), and matching (who should receive what?). In addition, we draw on bioethical frameworks for allocating scarce medical interventions to inform decisions.",2022,,American Journal of Public Health,112,3,378-382,2638087371,,,#3102,Shinn 2022,,
Risk and Protective Factors to LGBTQ+ Youth Suicide: A Review of the Literature: C & A,"Gorse, Michael","LGBTQ+ youth experience higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior than their cisgender, heterosexual peers, and these disparities have created a need for academic exploration of the risk factors and protective factors surrounding LGBTQ+ youth suicide (Taliaferro and Muehlenkamp in Acad Pediatr 17:715–722; Toomey et al. in J Youth Adolesc 48:788–801; Ybarra et al. in: Espelage et al. (eds) Youth suicide and bullying: challenges and strategies for prevention and intervention, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014). This paper reviews the research that has been completed on these topics in the last 10 years. A variety of risk factors have contributed to higher rates of suicidal ideation, attempts, and completion: minority stress, interpersonal constructs, race, transgender identity, partner violence, homelessness, school victimization, and a lack of school support (Joiner in Why people die by suicide, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005; Meyer in Psychol Bull 129:674–697; Mustanski and Liu in Arch Sex Behav 42:437–448; Van Orden et al. in Psychol Rev 117:575–600). Furthermore, a range of protective factors have been connected with lower rates of suicidal ideation and behavior: gender and sexuality alliances, LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum, LGBTQ+ affirming school policies, familial support, peer support, and mental health interventions (Poteat and Rivers in Youth suicide and bullying: challenges and strategies for prevention and intervention, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014; Stone et al. in Suicide Life Threat Behav 45:415–430; Whitaker et al. in J Adolesc Health 58:63–68).

A qualitative analysis of autonomy-supportive parenting in families experiencing homelessness,"Distefano, Rebecca; Nelson, Kayla M; Masten, Ann S","Objective: This exploratory qualitative study examined whether parents of young children residing in emergency housing endorse autonomy-supportive parenting values. Background: Young children experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for self-regulation difficulties, but one possible way to support self-regulation development during a window of plasticity in the preschool period is through autonomy-supportive parenting. Autonomy support has been shown to uniquely predict early self-regulation skills. However, there is also evidence to suggest that autonomy support could be problematic in risky environments. Method: Twenty-one parents of 3- to 6-year-old children participated in a brief interview about parenting and self-regulation development. Guided by self-determination theory, the interviews were subsequently coded for themes related to autonomy support. Results: Parents endorsed ideas consistent with autonomy support, such as recognizing children's capabilities and listening to children's ideas. However, parents also viewed some behaviors, such as offering young children choices, to be less acceptable. Conclusion: Findings suggest that parents experiencing homelessness may provide autonomy support in different ways than parents in more stable living conditions or from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. Implications: Parenting interventions that aim to promote early self-regulation development through autonomy-supportive practices might consider tailoring intervention components to align with the socialization priorities of families experiencing homelessness.",2022,,Family Relations,71,1,147-162,2620384135,10.1111/fare.l2626,,#3104,Distefano 2022,,
Implementing Indigenous Youth Peer Mentorship: Insights from the By Youth For Youth Project,"Lund, Jessie I; Mushquash, Christopher J; Carty, Hugette; Bobiński, Tina; Lichtenstein, Sidney; Daley, Mardi; Kidd, Sean A","Indigenous youth are disproportionately represented among youth experiencing homelessness in Canada, and are at an increased risk for mental health and substance use problems compared to nonIndigenous youth experiencing homelessness. Research is needed that considers how best to support Indigenous youth in acquiring and maintaining stable housing. Indigenous youth peer mentorship is one possible mechanism that warrants consideration, as Indigenous youth who have previously been homeless can share their experiences with barriers that other youth encounter, as well as skills that may be well-suited to facilitate hope and understanding for other homeless youth. In the present study, we examined the process by which Indigenous peer mentors engaged in a peer-driven project designed to support other Indigenous youth experiencing homelessness in Northwestern Ontario. This process was documented through qualitative interviews with three peer mentors and three staff, as well as ethnographic fieldnotes. Thematic analysis revealed that peer mentorship positions appear to be useful for the Indigenous youth who engage in them, as these positions provide a paid avenue to engage in advocacy and to support others whose experiences are similar to theirs.

Protective and resilience factors to promote mental health among Indigenous youth in Canada: a scoping review protocol,"Carrier, Leah; Hwayeon, Danielle Shin; Rothfus, Melissa A; Curran, Janet A","IntroductionMany mental health concerns emerge in adolescence and young adulthood, making this a critical period to initiate early interventions for mental health promotion and illness prevention. Although Indigenous young people in Canada are at a higher risk of mental health outcomes and faced with limited access to appropriate care and resources, they have unique strengths and resilience that promote mental health and wellness. Furthermore, resilience has been described as a ‘healing journey’ by Indigenous peoples, and interventions that account for the culture of these groups show promise in promoting mental health and wellness. As such, there is a need for innovative mental health interventions for Indigenous youth that transcend the Western biomedical model, use a strengths-based approach, and account for the cultural practices and belief systems of Indigenous peoples. This scoping review aims to explore the resilience and protective factors that promote mental health and wellness for Indigenous youth in present-day Canada with the aim of compiling and summarising the available literature on this topic to date.Methods and analysisThe review will follow Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for conducting scoping reviews. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and guidelines. We will include both published and unpublished grey literature and search the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, Embase and Scopus. The search of all databases was conducted on 26 August 2021. Further, we will use government and relevant Indigenous organisation websites. Two reviewers will independently screen and select the articles and extract the data.Ethics and disseminationNo ethical approval is required for this study. We will share the results through conference presentations and an open-access publication in a peer-reviewed journal. A lay-language report will be created and disseminated to community organisations that work with Indigenous youth.",2022,,BMJ Open,12,1,,2620243446,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049285,,#3106,Carrier 2022,,
Ending Australia’s Status as a “Leaving Care Laggard”: The Case for a National Extended Care Framework to Lift the Outcomes for Young People Transitioning From Out-of-Home Care,"Mendes, Philip","Young people transitioning from out-of-home care, commonly called care leavers, are known to be a vulnerable group. Many experience poor outcomes leading them to become homeless or involved in the criminal justice system. Yet compared to most other Anglophone democracies, Australia lacks mandatory assistance for care leavers beyond 18 years of age. There are also major legislative, policy, and program differences between care leaver entitlements in the individual states and territories. This paper argues that the Commonwealth Government should introduce a nationally consistent extended care system that would require all jurisdictions to provide a minimum standard of support until at least 21 years of age. A uniform set of extended care standards is even more vital in the context of COVID-19.IMPLICATIONSMany Australian care leavers have poor life chances despite recent advances in the support programs provided by the states and territories.A nationally consistent extended care program is likely to progress improved opportunities and outcomes for care leavers.",2022,,Australian Social Work,75,1,122-132,2612223573,10.1080/0312407X.2021.1910323,,#3107,Mendes 2022,,
“A Bad Combination”: Lived Experiences of Youth Involved in the Foster Care and Juvenile Justice Systems: C & A,"Simmons-Horton, Sherri Y","Youth with involvement in foster care and the juvenile justice system, often called dual-status youth, are at increased risk for negative outcomes as they transition into adulthood, including homelessness, and involvement in the adult criminal justice system. Increase of interest in the phenomenon of youth dual involvement within the last decade, reveals focus on challenges associated with the dual-status population, the importance of multi-system collaboration, and foster care factors contributing to juvenile delinquency. This study aims to build on the current literature, through exploration of how dually-involved youth make sense of their experiences in the juvenile justice and foster care systems; and what youth believe are their unique challenges of being in two systems? This phenomenological study engaged ten individuals in Houston, Texas, between the ages of 18 and 24 years old, and previously involved in the juvenile justice and foster care systems. Research subjects participated in-depth, semi-structured, and audio-recorded interviews, disclosing their experiences in two systems. Interviews were transcribed and entered in the qualitative analytical program, Atlas.ti, where common themes of participant responses were extracted. Accounts from participants highlighted three key experiences: (1) experiences of and leading to dual involvement, (2) traumatic experiences, and (3) absence of normalcy. Study results are categorized based on their pathways to dual-involvement. This current study offers rich insights into how dually-involved youth make sense of their experiences in the foster care and juvenile justice systems.

"Beyond the Homelessness, Crisis Accommodation, Poverty and Child Protection Cycle: Supportive housing for families with children and young people","Warren, Shane; Barnes, Adam","The social work and human services literature overwhelmingly emphasise the importance of safe, secure and affordable housing and adequate income support for families at risk of homelessness, domestic and family violence (DFV) or entering the statutory child protection system. Traditional residualist social welfare approaches to families experiencing these challenges, based on formulations of deserving and undeserving, including shelter accommodation, old or congregate public housing and statutory intervention, continue to fail children, young people and their families and be costly for governments. In contrast, Supportive Housing refers to all service delivery approaches based on the Housing First principle, whereby people at risk of homelessness or experiencing homelessness are assisted through access to a secure, affordable tenancy and the offer of fexible support services that are non-conditional to the tenancy. This paper explores the national and international evidence for good practice in housing and support responses to families at risk of or experiencing homelessness, DFV and statutory child protection intervention using a critical literature review methodology and critical social work frameworks. This paper highlights the evidence regarding supportive housing for families as a contemporary model that respects the agency and dignity of families to achieve their goals and aspirations.",2021,,Social Alternatives,40,4,48-55,2657442932,,,#3109,Warren 2021,,
"""From analog to digital"": The feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a positive parenting program for street-connected mothers in Kenya","Murphy, Kathleen; Embleton, Lonnie; Lachman, Jamie M; Owino, Eucabeth; Kirwa, Sheila; Makori, Dominic; Braitstein, Paula","Background: Children of street-connected women in Kenya are at risk of child maltreatment. There have been increasing calls for positive parenting programs for parents experiencing homelessness, however never has one been implemented with this population. We therefore adapted the evidence-based Parenting for Lifelong Health for Young Children program using participatory methods, and piloted the adapted program with street-connected mothers in Kenya. Objectives: To (a) determine if the adapted program was feasible and acceptable with street-connected mothers, and (b) assess indicative effects on child maltreatment, positive parenting, and parental stress. Participants and setting: Two groups of 15 mothers (ages 19+, and 20−) participated between June-July 2018 in Eldoret, Kenya. Participants were eligible if they (a) were the mother of at least one child and (b) self-identified as street-connected. Methods: Feasibility was measured via enrollment, attendance, drop-out rates, and engagement in take-away activities. Focus groups explored program acceptability and program outcomes. Self-report surveys assessed pre-post changes in child maltreatment, parental stress, parental sense of inefficacy, and positive parenting practices. Results: 70% of participants attended >3/4 of sessions, 10% dropped out, and >50% of take-away activities were completed. Participants reported high acceptability and requested its continuation for themselves and other parents. There was an increase in supporting good behaviour (t(21) = 8.15, p < .000) and setting limits (t(18) = 10.03, p < .000); a reduction in physical abuse (t(23) = −2.15, p = .042) and parental stress (t(22) = −7.08, p < .000); results for parental inefficacy were not statistically significant (t(22) = 0.15, p = .882).

Screening Discordance and Characteristics of Patients With Housing-Related Social Risks,"De Marchis, Emilia H, MD, MAS; de Cuba, Stephanie A Ettinger, MPH; Chang, Lawrence, MD; Sheward, Richard S, MPP; Doran, Kelly M, MD, MHS; Gottlieb, Laura M, MD, MPH; Cohen, Alicia J, MD, MSc; Fleegler, Eric W, MD, MPH; Sandel, Megan T, MD, MPH","Introduction Healthcare systems are increasingly interested in identifying patients' housing-related risks, but minimal information exists to inform screening question selection. The primary study aim is to evaluate discordance among 5 housing-related screening questions used in health care. Methods This was a cross-sectional multisite survey of social risks used in a convenience sample of adults seeking care for themselves or their child at 7 primary care clinics and 4 emergency departments across 9 states (2018–2019). Housing-related risks were measured using 2 questions from the Accountable Health Communities screening tool (current/anticipated housing instability, current housing quality problems) and 3 from the Children's HealthWatch recommended housing instability screening measures (prior 12-month: rent/mortgage strain, number of moves, current/recent homelessness). The 2-sided Fisher's exact tests analyzed housing-related risks and participant characteristics; logistic regression explored associations with reported health (2019–2020). Results Of 835 participants, 52% screened positive for ≥1 housing-related risk (n=430). Comparing the tools, 32.8% (n=274) screened discordant: 11.9% (n=99) screened positive by Children's HealthWatch questions but negative by Accountable Health Communities, and 21.0% (n=175) screened positive by the Accountable Health Communities tool but negative by Children's HealthWatch (p<0.001). Worse health was associated with screening positive for current/anticipated housing instability (AOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.32, 0.96) or current/recent homelessness (AOR=0.57, 95% CI=0.34, 0.96).

HEALTHCARE ACCESS FOR HOMELESS ADOLESCENTS & YOUNG ADULTS: A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT,"Heathcote, Sarah Rose, DO, MPH; Rosenthal, Leslie, MD, MS; Ricondo, Steven, MD; Hergenroeder, Albert, MD; Wiemann, Constance, PhD","Purpose: The more than 40,000 individuals who make up the homeless adolescent and young adult population on any given night in the United States face high rates of morbidity and mortality, with a life expectancy of thirty years less than the national average. With three times greater odds of poor health care access than their peers, homeless youth are often uninsured and rely heavily on emergency rooms for medical care. In an effort to improve health care accessibility and decrease inequities, the current quality improvement initiative's SMART aim was to increase, by 10% from baseline, the percent of a sheltered homeless youth cohort who have enrolled, or submitted applications to enroll, in a health insurance plan or the county's healthcare financial assistance program (HFAP) within 21 days of intake into the shelter program. Methods: An initial needs assessment was conducted through key stakeholder interviews, baseline data collection, process mapping, and the development of key driver and fishbone diagrams. Outcome measures, including insurance status and enrollment in the local health system's HFAP, were tracked weekly for homeless persons, aged 18 to 24 years, residing at a transitional housing program during the study period of January 2019 to April 2019. During this time, Plan Do Study Action (PDSA) cycle interventions included: 1) adoption of insurance documentation protocols in the shelter-based medical home, and 2) implementation of monthly Financial Assistance Program eligibility events on-site at the shelter facility. Duration from shelter intake to submission of HFAP application and satisfaction of the process from shelter service providers and youth were reported as process and balancing measures. Results: Chart review of fifty-six youth who had entered the housing program between September 2017 and January 2019 provided baseline information. Sixty-two youth entered post-intervention between January 2019 and April 2019. The adoption of insurance documentation protocols with PDSA cycle #1 lead to a significant increase in insurance status documentation to 56.5% (35/62; Z=3.65, p=0.00054) of medical records, compared with 25% (14/56) prior to the intervention. Thirty youth participated in HFAP eligibility events established with PDSA cycle #2; of those youth, 87.6% had a documented pre-existing health care need. The percent of insured or HFAP-applied residents increased significantly from a baseline average of 4% of residents per week (11/277), to 33% (76/233; Z=8.57, p=0.00001) in the month following PDSA cycle #1, and 39% (258/ 667; Z=10.76, p-0.00001) over two months following PDSA cycle #2. By the second HFAP eligibility event, 80% of participants submitted HFAP applications within 1 month of enrollment in the housing program. Conclusions: Insurance documentation protocols and a novel collaboration with the county health department, improved the ability of one transitional housing program's medical home to recognize and rapidly respond to the uninsured status of homeless youth. These interventions provide a unique model for other programs aiming to reduce health care access inequities among under-served populations.",2021,,"Journal of Adolescent Health, suppl.

EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE VICTIMIZATION AMONG AN ONLINE RECRUITED SAMPLE OF SEXUALLY ACTIVE ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USERS IN SOUTHERN METROPOLITAN AREAS,"Lambert, Danielle N, PhD, MPH; Swartzendruber, Andrea, PhD, MPH","Purpose: Violence is a serious public health issue with myriad short-and long-term impacts on development and health outcomes. Violence victimization can present as many typologies (e.g.., physical, psychological, sexual) and from different perpetrators (e.g., intimate partners, parents, peers). The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and typologies of violence victimization among an online recruited sample of sexually active adolescent substance users in southern metropolitan areas. Methods: This study aimed to recruit adolescents aged 13-17 years who reported being sexually active, having a history of substance use, and residing in one of five Southern metropolitan areas with high HIV incidence (Atlanta, GA; Columbia, SC; Jackson, MS; Jacksonville, FL; Memphis TN). Respondents were recruited online from January to March 2019 through social networking platforms, and 101 eligible adolescents were enrolled. The average age at baseline was 16.3 (SD=0.9) years. Results: At baseline, 65.3% (n=66) of adolescents reported prior victimization of at least one typology (physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, and neglect). Verbal (53.5%, n=54) and emotional (48.5%, n=49) abuse were the most commonly reported, followed by physical abuse (20.8%, n=21), sexual abuse (16.8%, n=17), and neglect (10.9%, n=ll). The majority of respondents (72.7%, n=48) reported experiencing more than one type of victimization. Specific to intimate partner violence (IPV), 29.7% (n=30) of respondents reported prior victimization. The most common form of IPV experienced was sexual coercion (26.7%, n=27) followed by sexual assault/rape (13.9%, n=14) and physical violence (9.9%, n=10). Eleven (10.9%) respondents indicated their first sexual experience was by force or without consent. Differences in violence victimization were observed by respondents' demographic characteristics. Biological females more frequently reported experiences of emotional abuse (p=.002), sexual abuse (p=.048), sexual coercion from a partner (p=.047), and any form of IPV (p=.048) as compared to biological males. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents more frequently reported verbal abuse (p=.036), sexual coercion from a partner (p=.035), and any form of IPV (p =.013) as compared to non-SGM adolescents. Adolescents with prior experiences of homelessness more frequently reported physical abuse (p=.005), verbal abuse (p=.005), emotional abuse (p=.018), and neglect (p=.003) as compared to adolescents with stable housing. Conclusions: Experiences of violence victimization were pervasive among this sample of high-risk adolescents. SGM adolescents and adolescents with experiences of homelessness disproportionately reported prior victimization, similar to other studies showing a greater burden of victimization among females, SGM, and other vulnerable youth. Public health and medicine professionals should increase efforts to discuss violence prevention, reporting, and resources with young people at an early age, especially more vulnerable children and young people. In line with findings from this study showing that adolescents prefer online and technology-based modalities for interventions and service delivery, innovative prevention interventions and communication campaigns are also needed to address and prevent violence victimization, particularly IPV, among adolescents via commonly used digital channels and platforms.

Promoting Personal Growth in Young People Experiencing Homelessness Through an Outdoors-Based Program,"Parry, Benjamin John","Outdoors-based youth development programs demonstrate the efficacy to improve indicators of personal growth and mental health in a range of disadvantaged young people. However, the most marginalized young people in society, who stand to benefit the most from such initiatives, remain underrepresented in the research. My Strengths Training for Life (MST4Life) is a positive youth development (PYD) intervention for young people experiencing homelessness that incorporates a life skills program and an outdoor adventure education (OAE) course. The current study presents a qualitative investigation of the OAE course to understand its role in promoting positive changes for participants. Reflexive thematic analysis led to the development of inductively driven themes which were conceptualized based on relevant theories (e.g., relational developmental systems) and models (e.g., 5 Cs of PYD). Findings highlight the benefits of a preceding life skills program to psychologically prepare participants to thrive in the unfamiliar setting of the outdoors and related challenges. During the course, adaptive developmental regulations supported participants’ basic psychological needs and fostered personal growth. Improvements in social competence was a common theme across participants and played a pivotal role in facilitating balanced development across the 5 Cs. In addition, experiences during the course promoted indicators of mental health and intentions to make positive lifestyle changes. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to making outdoors-based youth development courses more accessible for marginalized young people, as well as how OAE and PYD programs can add value to the youth homeless sector.",2021,,Journal of Youth Development,16,5,157-192,3124249691,10.5195/jyd.2021.1061,,#3115,Parry 2021,,

The threats facing young people in housing crisis are many, and their potential impacts, harrowing. Youth are at high risk for physical and sexual victimization, mental and physical illness, and involvement with the criminal legal system and face serious threats to their education, their future economic stability, and their lives. Despite these dangerous consequences, the response to this issue in the United States continues to lack urgency, meaningful investment, and empirical support. This article critically examines the current approach to services for youth in situations of homelessness in the United States. Directly informed by the lived experiences of young people, it calls for a shift in understanding of the nature and scope of the problem and, consequently, the practice and policy strategies being implemented to address it.

Pushing for the same thing on the same set of tracks: a qualitative study exploring the anti-trafficking response in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,"Burns, Courtney Julia; Chen, Keiko; Stoklosa, Hanni","Background Human trafficking is a critical public health issue particularly pervasive in the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP), which share a border with Nepal. Many NGOs are participating in prevention, protection, prosecution, and capacity building initiatives. The aim of this study was to identify factors hindering and enhancing the efficacy of anti-trafficking programs in the region.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal.ResultsThematic analysis revealed that the barriers hindering the anti-trafficking movement include police corruption, insufficient enforcement of national law, discrimination toward trafficking victims, inadequate funding, and lack of government involvement. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers were through empowering survivors and increasing cooperation, coordination, and communications between NGOs and the government.ConclusionsIn mitigating these barriers and increasing survivor autonomy, anti-trafficking interventions have the opportunity to create individualized environments for those with an experience of trafficking to thrive.

As he stood there, in shock and disbelief, the young man who was responsible for the fire showed up, smirking at him. Dennis had a choice: he could vent his anger and disappointment at this person who had received care from both Dennis and his staff. He could do this by either delivering a scolding with great amplitude or simmering intensity, or he could do it by coldly turning away and showing no response.

Direct and indirect pathways between childhood instability and adult homelessness in a low-income population,"Cohen-Cline, Hannah; Jones, Kyle; Vartanian, Keri","There is a homelessness crisis in the United States. Many investments have been made to reverse this crisis including building more affordable housing and providing rent subsidies, which create mechanisms to support people who are currently experiencing homelessness. However, less is known about how to invest upstream to prevent homelessness in the first place. In this paper, we explore the pathway to adult homelessness from childhood instability through potentially modifiable adolescent experiences including running away, school dropout, and abuse of drugs or alcohol. We used results from our life course survey of a Medicaid population (N = 2,348) in a large metropolitan area in Oregon to create a structural equation model that measured the relationships between these experiences and adult homelessness. The overall effect of childhood instability on adult homelessness was 0.475 (p < 0.001). The direct effect of childhood instability on homelessness was 0.313 (p < 0.001). Both running away from home and alcohol and drug abuse mediated the overall association between childhood instability and homelessness. Running away from home (0.108, p < 0.001)) accounted for 22.7% of the overall association; alcohol and drug abuse (0.051, p = 0.053) accounted for 10.7%. In contrast, dropping out of school did not mediate the overall association between childhood instability and adult homelessness. These results strongly emphasize the importance of intervening upstream to reduce childhood instability to help prevent adult homelessness.

Additionally, trusting relationships with programme workers enabled trainees to feel safe, develop skills, pursue goals, manage health problems, improve relationships and engage in life roles. Trainees said Cash Pointers was accessible and responsive, offering advocacy, inter-agency liaison and hope. Programme workers said they balanced the need for quick results with patient relationship-building, were a well-supported team with a high degree of casework autonomy and felt skilled in the therapeutic use of self.  Conclusion  Cash Pointers created a psychologically informed environment within which trainees stabilised, acquired skills and progressed towards greater life satisfaction and inclusion.

Learning through interactions: a pilot study of family interventions for at-risk children,"Krippel, Misty Dawn; Burke, Meghan M; Rios, Kristina","Although many young children face risk factors for academic failure, most research about family interventions do not focus on at-risk children. For example, although Parents Interacting with Infants Model (i.e. PIWI) and Baby TALK programmes are widely used family interventions, no empirical research has been conducted about PIWI or Baby TALK among at-risk children. To this end, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of two family interventions (i.e. Baby TALK and PIWI) among 38 at-risk families of young children, as well as to identify barriers to implementation. Significant increases in parent knowledge about child development were evident among participants in both the intervention groups.

Supportive housing for precariously housed families in the child welfare system: Who benefits most?,"Glendening, Zachary S; Shinn, Marybeth; Brown, Scott R; Cleveland, Kyndra C; Cunningham, Mary K; Pergamit, Michael R","Background Supportive housing is a promising intervention for insecurely housed families in the child welfare system. Objectives We examined factors associated with housing and child welfare outcomes to understand whom supportive housing benefits the most. Participants and setting Analyses included 500 insecurely housed families involved in child protective services across five U.S. sites. Researchers randomized families to receive supportive housing or the usual services offered to families in local child welfare systems. Methods We examined predictors of homelessness and child welfare outcomes with logistic regression, survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves. We also examined supportive housing's effect across risk levels for each outcome and tested theoretical moderators of intervention effects. Results Consistent with findings from the larger project of which this was a part, supportive housing improved housing outcomes for families, especially those most at risk form homelessness. Its effects on child welfare outcomes varied by study site more than by risk level. Family characteristics and experiences that predicted housing and child welfare outcomes also varied by site and added limited accuracy to predictive models. Theoretical moderators did not influence supportive housing's effects. Conclusions Supportive housing increases housing security and may influence child welfare outcomes in some contexts.

Addressing the Consequences of School Closure Due to COVID‐19 on Children's Physical and Mental Well‐Being,"Hoffman, Jessica A; Miller, Edward A","Prolonged school closures are one of the most disruptive forces in the COVID‐19 era. School closures have upended life for children and families, and educators have been forced to determine how to provide distance learning. Schools are also an essential source of nonacademic supports in the way of health and mental health services, food assistance, obesity prevention, and intervention in cases of homelessness and maltreatment. This article focuses on the physical and emotional toll resulting from school closures and the withdrawal of nonacademic supports that students rely on. The COVID‐19 pandemic is shining a spotlight on how important schools are for meeting children's nonacademic needs. We argue that when students return to school there will be a more acute and wider‐spread need for school‐based nonacademic services and supports. Further, we expect that COVID‐19 will serve as a focusing event opening a window of opportunity for programmatic and policy change that improves nonacademic services and supports in the future.",2020,,World Medical & Health Policy,12,3,300-310,2441764177,10.1002/wmh3.365,,#3132,Hoffman 2020,,
Intergenerational Effects of Early Parental Adversity on Child Developmental Outcomes among Families Living in Emergency Homeless Shelters,"Lafavor, Theresa; De Boer, Danielle; Poole, Megan","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with persistent physical and psychological impairments over time and intergenerational transmission of trauma. Few studies have examined contexts of acute adversity with an eye toward understanding intergenerational transmission of ACEs. Homelessness and residential mobility are strongly associated with increased deficits across key developmental domains throughout the lifespan. This study (N = 86 parent-child dyads living in emergency housing) examined the effect of parent ACEs under the age of 18 years on parent and child lifetime adverse experiences. Results demonstrated significant relationships between parent ACEs and parent adversity over 18 years of age, child lifetime adversity, and current child trauma symptomatology.

"A Multi-Level Analysis of the Effects of Independent Living Programs on Educational Attainment, Employment, and Housing Outcomes of Youth Aging Out of Foster Care","Liu, Chun","Youth aging out of foster care system normally face multiple disadvantages in terms of educational attainment, employment, housing, financial stability, and life skills compared with children in the general population. About two-thirds of eligible youth in care receive Independent Living Programs (ILPs), which are designed to support youth and ensure a successful transition to adulthood. The objective of this paper is to examine whether ILPs are effectively promoting better outcomes (e.g., educational attainment, employment, housing) for youth aging out of foster care. Using data from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), this study used Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (HGLM) to investigate how different services from ILPs impact the educational attainment, employment, and homelessness of youth aging out of foster care across all 50 states in the United States. The study sample included youth in foster care from a FY 2014 cohort (N = 5633) on Wave 3 at age 21. Controlling for all the covariates, youth who received post-secondary educational support, budget and financial management, and financial assistance for education were more likely to achieve higher educational attainment. Youth who received post-secondary educational support and supervised independent living were more likely to get employed. The results indicated that certain types of ILPs services were associated with positive outcomes in terms of education, employment and housing. Post-secondary educational support service was found to be the most effective type of service for improving all the outcomes. The findings suggest the importance of providing ILPs to youth aging out of foster care. In addition, variation in service delivery and implementation fidelity across states must be taken into consideration.",2020,,Child Welfare,98,4,97-120,2509358243,,,#3137,Liu 2020,,

This paper reviews the state of America’s children and families, highlighting the influence of stressful contextual and social conditions on child and family well-being and the concentration of disadvantage in numerous neighborhoods and communities throughout the nation. It then briefly reviews the progress that has been made in pinpointing policies that can reduce stressful contextual conditions such as poverty, discrimination, and the marketing of unhealthful foods and substances. It also describes numerous family and school interventions that have proven benefit in preventing psychological and behavioral problems as diverse as tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; depression; antisocial behavior; academic failure; obesity prevention; and early childbearing. We argue that progress in translating existing knowledge into widespread benefit will require a nationwide effort to intervene comprehensively in neighborhoods and communities of concentrated disadvantage. We present a strategic plan for how such an effort could be organized. The first step in this organizing would be the creation of a broad and diverse coalition of organizations concerned with advancing public health and well-being. Such a coalition could increase public support both for the policies needed to focus on these disadvantaged areas and the research needed to incrementally improve our ability to help these areas.",2020,,Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review,23,2,153-175,2396572207,10.1007/s10567-020-00318-0,,#3138,Biglan 2020,,

Associations between negative life experiences and the mental health of trans and gender diverse young people in Australia: findings from Trans Pathways,"Strauss, Penelope; Cook, Angus; Winter, Sam; Watson, Vanessa; Dani Wright Toussaint; Lin, Ashleigh","BackgroundTrans and gender diverse (TGD) young people worldwide experience high rates of poor mental health; however, these rates were unknown in Australia. In addition, how negative life events affect the mental health of TGD young people has been largely unexplored.MethodsThis paper reports on novel mental health findings of Trans Pathways, the largest study ever conducted in Australia with trans (transgender) and gender diverse young people (N = 859; aged 14–25 years). The study was an anonymous online cross-sectional survey undertaken in 2016. Logistic and linear regression models were used to test associations between mental health outcomes and negative life experiences.ResultsTGD young people in Australia experience high levels of mental distress, including self-harming (79.7%), suicidal thoughts (82.4%), and attempting suicide (48.1%). Three in four participants had been diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety (74.6% and 72.2%, respectively). Many TGD young people had been exposed to negative experiences such as peer rejection (89.0%), precarious accommodation (22.0%), bullying (74.0%), and discrimination (68.9%). Most poor mental health outcomes were associated with negative experiences. The strongest associations were found for precarious accommodation and issues within educational settings. For example, participants with a prior suicide attempt were almost six times more likely to have experienced issues with accommodation, including homelessness.ConclusionsThe current results highlight the urgent need for better mental health care and provide insight into areas for targeted mental health interventions.

"""Harder Being Without the Baby"": Fathers' Coparenting Perspectives in Responsible Fatherhood Programming","Randles, Jennifer","Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze how marginalized men's coparenting perspectives and experiences shaped their engagement with a responsible fatherhood program (RFP). Background: Previous studies of fathers enrolled in RFPs found that their coparenting relationships have both positive and negative components and that program participation is associated with better coparenting communication. Yet men also report strained coparenting relationships as a primary barrier to paternal involvement. More exploratory research is needed to understand how fathers use RFPs to navigate coparenting challenges. Method: In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with a nonrandom sample of 64 low-income fathers of color who participated in a federally funded RFP. Inductive coding techniques revealed how men used the program to manage complex and conflicted coparenting arrangements and to gain greater access to their children. Results: The program helped fathers manage common coparenting challenges, including interpersonal conflict, mothers' perceived gatekeeping, and financial obstacles. They found support for forming closer relationships with children outside ""package deal"" understandings of fathering and for proving their paternal commitments amid severe economic constraints. Conclusion: Fathers enrolled in an RFPprimarily due to conflicted coparenting relationships exacerbated by poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Program services helped them navigate the challenges of raising children with partners, exes, or coparents with whom they never had a romantic connection. Implications: These findings reinforce the importance of addressing coparenting in RFPs. Messages and services should align with how fathers prioritize bonds with children and seek to prove their paternal commitments to coparents.",2020,,Journal of Marriage and Family,82,2,550-565,2374198922,10.1111/jomf.12641,,#3144,Randles 2020,,
Legislative discrepancies: an analysis of Missouri’s current human trafficking laws and the need to improve its legal protection of victims,"Kappler, Rachel; Arduizur Carli Richie-Zavaleta","PurposeHuman trafficking (HT) is a local, national and international problem with a range of human rights, public health and policy implications. Victims of HT face atrocious abuses that negatively impact their health outcomes. When a state lacks protective laws, such as Safe Harbor laws, victims of HT tend to be seen as criminals. This paper aims to highlight the legal present gaps within Missouri’s anti-trafficking legislation and delineates recommendations for the legal protection of victims of HT and betterment of services needed for their reintegration and healing.Design/methodology/approachThis case-study is based on a policy analysis of current Missouri’s HT laws. This analysis was conducted through examining current rankings systems created by nationally and internationally recognized non-governmental organizations as well as governmental reports. Additionally, other state’s best practice and law passage of Safe Harbor legislations were examined. The recommendations were based on human rights and public health frameworks.FindingsMissouri is a state that has yet to upgrade its laws lately to reflect Safe Harbor laws. Constant upgrades and evaluations of current efforts are necessary to protect and address HT at the state and local levels. Public health and human rights principles can assist in the upgrading of current laws as well as other states’ best-practice and integration of protective legislation and diversion programs to both youth and adult victims of HT.Research limitations/implicationsLaws are continually being updated at the state level; therefore, there might be some upgrades that have taken place after the analysis of this case study was conducted. Also, the findings and recommendations of this case study are limited to countries that are similar to the USA in terms of the state-level autonomy to pass laws independently from federal law.Practical implicationsIf Safe Harbor laws are well designed, they have greater potential to protect, support and assist victims of HT in their process from victimization into survivorship as well as to paving the way for societal reintegration. The creation and enforcement of Safe Harbor laws is a way to ensure the decriminalization process. Additionally, this legal protection also ensures that the universal human rights of victims are protected. Consequently, these legal processes and updates could assist in creating healthier communities in the long run in the USA and around the world.Social implicationsFrom a public health and human rights perspectives, communities in the USA and around the world cannot provide complete protection to victims of HT until their anti-trafficking laws reflect Safe Harbor laws.Originality/valueThis case study, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, is a unique analysis that dismantles the discrepancies of Missouri’s current HT laws. This work is valuable to those who create policies at the state level and advocate for the protection of victims and anti-trafficking efforts.",2020,,International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,13,2,143-158,2498996220,10.1108/IJHRH-08-2019-0063,,#3145,Kappler 2020,,
HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG HOMELESS YOUTHdHOW DO YOUTH IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS COMPARE?,"O'Brien, Janna R Gewirtz, MD; McRee, Annie-Laurie, DrPH","Purpose: Although youth living in rural areas experience homelessness at similar rates as youth living in urban areas, most research with homeless youth has focused on urban contexts. Little is known about health needs of rural homeless youth or about differences among these populations. Resources targeting youth homelessness are limited generally but are particularly sparse in rural areas. Understanding the unique health needs of different populations of homeless youth is critical for designing interventions. We sought to assess geographic differences in health outcomes and healthcare utilization among unaccompanied homeless youth. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 9th and 11th graders who responded to the statewide Minnesota Student Survey in 2016. The survey assessed whether youth had ""stayed in a shelter, somewhere not intended as a place to live, or someone else's home because [they] had no other place to stay?"" One-percent of the overall sample (n=802) endorsed the answer answered ""Yes-I was on my own without any adult family"" and were, thus, included in our analytic sample. Among unaccompanied homeless youth: half (50%) were from Greater Minnesota (""rural""), mirroring the distribution of the overall sample (48% rural, 52% urban); 58% were male; 68% were white; 26% identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual; and 47% received free and reduced lunch (an indicator of poverty). We performed multivariable logistic regression to compare 5 health outcomes (self-reported general health; depressive symptoms; suicide attempts in past year; history of ever having sex; history of experiencing a pregnancy [self or partner]) between groups, controlling for demographics. We also conducted chi-square analyses to compare receipt of a preventive health visit in the prior year, as recommended by adolescent care guidelines, among rural and urban homeless youth. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between rural and urban youth with regards to health and health care utilization outcomes. Controlling for demographics, rural and urban youth reported similar levels of: very good or excellent health (45% for both groups); depressive symptoms (rural: 36% vs urban: 35%); suicide attempts (22% vs. 23%); ever having sex (65% vs. 64% ); experiencing a pregnancy (11% vs. 10%); and having received a preventive health visit in the prior year (56% vs. 61%, all p≥.05). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare health indicators between rural and urban unaccompanied homeless youth. Findings from this statewide sample suggest that youth face similar general-, mental-, and sexual health risks, regardless of their geographic context. The prevalence of these risks is notably higher than that found among stably-housed populations of youth. Despite the prevalence of homelessness among both urban and rural youthd and the significant associated riskdmost interventions and programs focus on urban youth. Given the known differences in experiences of youth homelessness in rural communities, tailored interventions for this population are critical. High levels of well-child care highlight the potential of primary care as a point of screening and intervention. Future research is needed to identify how to best tailor interventions for rural youth facing homelessness.",2020,,Journal of Adolescent Health,66,2S,,2375484997,,,#3146,O'Brien 2020,,
"""I NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO TURN TO"": UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH AFFECTED BY PARENTAL DRUG USE","Offiong, Asari, MPH; Powell, Terrinieka, PhD; Lewis, Quiana, MPH; Smith, Bianca, MPH; Prioleau, Morgan, BS","Purpose: Adolescents with a family history of substance use have a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors including illegal activity, early sexual initiation and substance use. Research suggests that about 25% of children are exposed to parental substance abuse before age 18. Many parents who use drugs cannot adequately care for their children because of incarceration, homelessness, extended periods of drug use, or enrollment in drug treatment. Understanding the unique needs of youth whose parents use drugs would yield targeted strategies that inform interventions aimed at promoting well-being among this population. We conducted a qualitative study to understand the needs and barriers of African American adolescents with a substance-abusing parent in Baltimore. Methods: We conducted 60 to 75 minute in-depth interviews (N=29) with three participant types: parents with a history of drug use, young adults ( 18-24yo) who had a biological parent with a history of drug use and youth providers who had experience working with families affected by drug use. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire prior to the interview. All participants were African American and either lived or worked in Baltimore city. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed by a professional transcription company. Atlas.ti 8.0 was used as a data management system. Five research team members developed a code book, double coded all transcripts and analyzed inductively using a qualitative content analytic approach. Techniques such as constant comparisons, memo writing, and peer review were used to ensure credibility. Any discrepancies in coding were reconciled with the entire research team. All study procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Results: Participants were consistent in their assessment of the primary needs of youth affected by parental drug use: stability, safety and support. Basic needs such as stable housing, food and money were described as being unmet. Access to and awareness of.safe spaces were identified as challenges for young people. Finally, participants noted that emotional support often left youth in these families feeling unloved, misunderstood and lacking guidance to make healthy decisions. Due to the complexity of families affected by drug use, consistent support from people, continued connections to resources and collaborations across systems were identified as strategies to offset the potentially negative influence of parental drug use on youth. Conclusions: Parental absence due to drug use creates more opportunities for negative, risky behaviors to occur among youth. Findings from the study deepen the understanding of how to support the well-being of youth impacted by parental drug use. Our findings highlight the value of including the voices of vulnerable families in research and exploring community-based strategies for addressing their needs. Furthermore, the needs and strategies described may be used to advance the research and practice of others who are investigating ways to mitigate the negative effects of childhood adversity.",2020,,Journal of Adolescent Health,66,2S,,2375484950,,,#3147,Offiong 2020,,
EMPOWERING PARENTS FOR WELLNESS IN SHELTER (EMPOWER): DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A HEALTH EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM FOR PARENTING HOMELESS YOUTH,"O'Brien, Janna R Gewirtz, MD; Brar, Pooja, PhD; Worley, Jennifer, APRN, CNP; Basham, Michelle, MPA/Esq; Kelly, Emily, MPH; McRee, Annie-Laurie, DrPH; Mehus, Christopher J, PhD, LMFT","Purpose: Approximately 700,000 U.S. adolescents (aged 13-17) face homelessness annually. Among them, 10% of females and 3% of males are either pregnant or parenting, posing a multi-generational threat to health. Yet, there are few programs to improve health among parenting homeless youth and their children. To address this gap, an urban youth shelter launched a new transitional housing program for parenting youth with programming to improve parent and child health, and reduce unplanned subsequent pregnancies. The purpose of this community-engaged study was to adapt and implement an evidence-supported health empowerment program for pregnant and parenting youth living in shelter, and assess the program's feasibility and acceptability. Methods: Guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework for implementation research, we conducted a mixed-methods community needs assessment employing key informant interviews, focus groups, and/or questionnaires with three stakeholder groups: previously or currently homeless youth (n=17), shelter staff (n=20), and community experts (n=5). The needs assessment focused on program content and design. We analyzed data using content analysis (qualitative data) and descriptive statistics (quantitative data). A community-based team, including youth, staff, clinicians and researchers, selected an existing evidence-informed curriculum for a unified group-based intervention and tailored the intervention to address stakeholder-identified content areas and elements of program design. We further adapted the program using interviews, informal focus groups and surveys with youth participants (n=5) and program staff (n=5). All youth were female and pregnant or parenting, with children ages 0-3. Results: Our needs assessment identified several content areas of importance, including sexual health (e.g., healthy sexuality, relationships), mental health (e.g., post-partum mood concerns, trauma), and child health. Youth and staff identified several priorities for the program's design including that it should: be adaptable; incorporate a strengths-based, culturally-competent, and traumainformed approach; develop skills around both health and health care; leverage the key role of staff in promoting youth health; and integrate youth voice. Preliminary implementation data revealed that the program was acceptable to youth and staff, and aligned with the mission of the housing program. During implementation, group facilitators adapted the intervention to further integrate child- and mental-health content in response to participants' feedback and requests. With respect to program structure, participants: favored shorter sessions (1 hour), requested consistent female leaders, appreciated access to healthcare providers (group co-facilitators), and recognized the importance of childcare during sessions. Conclusions: Though youth parents and their children living in shelter face significant health risk, our initial findings suggest that health empowerment programming may be a feasible means of fostering resilience among this vulnerable population. Parents in the study expressed an interest in improving their own health and that of their child. Using the EPIS framework, this work highlights the importance of engaging youth, staff and community partners at all stages of a programdfrom initial exploration through program implementation. Future directions include: conducting ongoing feasibility evaluation, planning for sustainment, and scaling the intervention to similar transitional housing settings for parenting youth.",2020,,Journal of Adolescent Health,66,2S,,2375481745,,,#3148,O'Brien 2020,,

This research involved the participation of care leavers, government functionaries, duty-bearers, and civil society practitioners. It found that upon turning 18, youth transitioning out of child care institutions to independent life in India experience many challenges, such as securing housing and identity documents; accessing education, skill development, and employment opportunities; and garnering psychosocial support. This study also showed that absent or inadequate aftercare support during transition increases care leavers’ vulnerabilities to homelessness, unemployment, substance misuse, and ruptured social relationships. It also found that continued aftercare support is necessary to foster independent living skills in these young people and enable their reintegration into mainstream society. While exploring the continuum from child care to aftercare, the researchers developed the concept of a “Sphere of Aftercare”, comprising eight domains of support that are considered essential for a successful transition. The study revealed a lack of transition planning at the level of child care institutions and functionaries and a general lack of understanding of the holistic aftercare needs of youth throughout the eight identified domains. The study also found an absence of clarity about stakeholders’ roles; a lack of data management with regard to the number of youth leaving care, leading to inadequate budget planning; and a lack of adequate monitoring mechanisms to assess care leavers’ outcomes. In light of this study’s findings, policy reforms and ways of developing robust aftercare programmes are recommended in relation to policy, practice, and law.",2020,,"International Journal of Child, Youth & Family Studies",11,4.2,160-187,2487186038,10.18357/ijcyfs114.2202020049,,#3150,Modi 2020,,
Strong families: a new family skills training programme for challenged and humanitarian settings: a single-arm intervention tested in Afghanistan,"Haar, Karin; El-Khani, Aala; Molgaard, Virginia; Maalouf, Wadih","Background Children living in challenged humanitarian settings (including those in rural/underserved areas, the displaced, refugees, in conflict/post conflict situations) are at greater risk of mental health difficulties or behavioural problems, with caregivers acting as their main protective factors. While many family skills programmes exist, very few were developed for, or piloted in, low resource settings (settings with limited infrastructure, typical of humanitarian settings). We therefore designed a brief and light programme; the Strong Families (SF) programme, consisting of 5 h contact time over 3 weeks. We conducted a pilot study with the aim to test the feasibility of implementation, and a preliminary look at the effectiveness of SF, in improving child behaviour and family functioning in families living in Afghanistan.MethodsWe recruited female caregivers and children aged 8–12 years through schools and drug treatment centres in Afghanistan and enrolled them in the SF programme. Demographic data, emotional and behavioural difficulties of children and parental skills and family adjustment measures were collected from caregivers before, 2 and 6 weeks after the intervention. Outcome was assessed through the SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), assessing children’s behavioural, emotional, and social issues, and PAFAS (Parenting and Family Adjustment Scales), measuring parenting practices and family functioning.ResultsWe enrolled 72 families in the programme with a 93.1% retention rate (n = 67) for data collection 6 weeks post intervention. Mean age of caregivers was 36.1 years, they had 3.8 children on average and 91.7% of them had experienced war/armed conflict in their past. The average total difficulty score of the SDQ (ranging from 0 to 40, with scores above 16 being indicative of high problems) of the 72 children reduced significantly, from 17.8 at pre-test to 12.9 at post-test and 10.6 at second follow-up, with no difference in gender and most noticeably amongst those with the highest scores at baseline. Likewise, PAFAS scores decreased significantly after the programme, again with caregivers with the highest scores at baseline improving most.ConclusionsThe implementation of a brief family skills programme was seemingly effective and feasible in a resource-limited setting and positively improved child mental health and parenting practices and family adjustment skills. These results suggest the value of such a programme and call for further validation through other methods of impact assessment and outcome evaluation.Trial registrationISRCTN76509384.

Interventions to support people exposed to adverse childhood experiences: systematic review of systematic reviews,"Lorenc, Theo; Lester, Sarah; Sutcliffe, Katy; Stansfield, Claire; Thomas, James","Background Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) such as abuse, neglect or household adversity may have a range of serious negative impacts. There is a need to understand what interventions are effective to improve outcomes for people who have experienced ACEs.MethodsSystematic review of systematic reviews. We searched 18 database sources from 2007 to 2018 for systematic reviews of effectiveness data on people who experienced ACEs aged 3–18, on any intervention and any outcome except incidence of ACEs. We included reviews with a summary quality score (AMSTAR) of 5.5 or above.ResultsTwenty-five reviews were included. Most reviews focus on psychological interventions and mental health outcomes. The strongest evidence is for cognitive-behavioural therapy for people exposed to abuse. For other interventions – including psychological therapies, parent training, and broader support interventions – the findings overall are inconclusive, although there are some positive results.ConclusionsThere are significant gaps in the evidence on interventions for ACEs. Most approaches focus on mitigating individual psychological harms, and do not address the social pathways which may mediate the negative impacts of ACEs. Many negative impacts of ACEs (e.g. on health behaviours, social relationships and life circumstances) have also not been widely addressed by intervention studies.",2020,,BMC Public Health,20,,10-Jan,2404456711,10.1186/s12889-020-08789-0,,#3152,Lorenc 2020,,

This growth in emphasis and evidence has not been mirrored in the area of youth peer support broadly nor peer support among homeless youth specifically. This situation has persisted despite the growing emphasis on youth lived experience engagement—including peer support. This paucity of literature framed the rationale for the present paper that provides a description of the structure, processes, and preliminary outcomes of an intentional peer support program delivered in the context of tertiary prevention of youth homelessness in a large Canadian urban setting. Pre-post findings for a cohort of 28 youth are reported in key mental health and community engagement domains and qualitative data from interviews with participants, peer supports, and staff are presented. These findings suggest that peer support would seem to be both a feasible and potentially impactful part of the repertoire of interventions from service to policy levels that are needed to address the complex and persistent global problem of youth homelessness. While promising, our work also suggests that peer support cannot be an afterthought-type element of programming but must be robust in process and structure to facilitate improvement for service recipients, the wellness of the peers, and the benefits for the team as a whole that results from effective peer engagement.",2019,,Child & Adolescent Social Work Journal,36,6,641-654,2188819525,10.1007/s10560-019-00610-1,,#3153,Kidd 2019,,

Ensuring Compliance With Quarantine by Undocumented Immigrants and Other Vulnerable Groups: Public Health Versus Politics,"Rothstein, Mark A, JD; Coughlin, Christine N, JD","A successful quarantine requires a high rate of compliance by individuals with potential exposure to a communicable disease. Many individuals would be reluctant to comply with a quarantine because they fear that contact with government officials will place them in legal, personal, or economic jeopardy. These include undocumented immigrants and individuals with a substance use disorder. For a quarantine to succeed, individuals must be granted temporary immunity from arrest, deportation, or similar adverse consequences, but doing so will be politically unpopular.

Homelessness in Childhood and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs),"Radcliff, Elizabeth; Crouch, Elizabeth; Strompolis, Melissa; Srivastav, Aditi","Objectives Research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) has provided a valuable framework for understanding associations between childhood maltreatment and family dysfunction and later poor health outcomes. However, increasing research suggests the number and types of childhood adversities measured warrants further examination. This study examines ACE exposure among adults who experienced homelessness in childhood, another type of childhood adversity. Methods This cross-sectional, descriptive study used the 2016 South Carolina (SC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey and additional ACE modules to examine ACE exposure among SC adults and childhood homelessness. Standard descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable. Bivariate analysis compared types and number of ACEs by childhood homeless status. All analyses used survey sampling weights that accounted for the BRFSS sampling strategy. Results Data from 7490 respondents were weighted for analyses. Among the 215 respondents who reported homelessness in childhood, 68.1% reported experiencing four or more ACEs. In contrast, only 16.3% of respondents who reported no homelessness in childhood reported experiencing four or more ACEs. The percent of respondents was significantly higher for each of 11 ACEs among those who reported childhood homelessness, compared to those who did not. Conclusions for Practice Adults who reported homelessness in childhood also reported significantly greater exposure to higher numbers and types of ACEs than adults reporting no childhood homelessness. Study findings can be important in informing additional indicators important to the assessment of ACEs and to program developers or organizations that provide housing assistance to at-risk families and children.",2019,,Maternal and Child Health Journal,23,6,811-820,2211692002,10.1007/s10995-018-02698-w,,#3156,Radcliff 2019,,

The health challenges of families experiencing homelessness,"Bridget Osei Henewaah Annor; Oudshoorn, Abe","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to report the findings of a scoping review on the health challenges of families experiencing homelessness. There is a bi-directional relationship between health and homelessness in that poor health can increase the risk of housing loss, and experiencing homelessness is bad for one’s health. The experience of homelessness differs between populations and this review focuses on families as one of the fastest growing segments of the homeless population. While research has been integrated on the causes of homelessness for families, this same integration has not been conducted looking at health challenges of families experiencing homelessness.Design/methodology/approachA scoping review methodology is utilized in the paper. As the goal of this work is to ultimately develop interventions for a Canadian context, primacy is given to Canadian sources, but other relevant literature is also included.FindingsA clear distinction is seen in the literature between health challenges of children of homeless families and health challenges of parents.

"Understanding Organizations Serving Runaway and Homeless Youth: A Multi-setting, Multi-perspective Qualitative Exploration: C & A","Gwadz, Marya; Freeman, Robert; Leonard, Noelle R; Kutnick, Alexandra; Silverman, Elizabeth; Ritchie, Amanda; Bolas, James; Cleland, Charles M; Tabac, Lara; Hirsch, Margo; Powlovich, Jamie","Runaway and homeless youth (RHY) are dependent on the specialized settings that locate, engage, and serve them. Yet, little research has focused on the features of effective settings for RHY. The present qualitative study, grounded in the Youth Program Quality Assessment model, explored characteristics of higher quality organizations for RHY and gaps that remain from staff and RHY perspectives. A total of 29 diverse settings serving RHY in New York State were randomly selected for participation, and ranked on a quantitative program quality index. Within settings, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with program administrators (N = 30) and other staff (N = 24). Focus group interviews were conducted with RHY (N = 13 focus groups; N = 84 RHY). Data were analyzed using a systematic content analysis approach that was both theory-driven and inductive, comparing higher to lower quality settings. We found all settings provided vital services and experienced challenges, but higher quality settings ameliorated challenges through (1) a youth-centered program philosophy equally understood by staff and RHY; (2) developmentally appropriate relationships between staff and RHY that promoted autonomy; (3) a focus on short- and long-term goals within anticipated crises; and (4) ongoing internal quality assessment procedures. Within lower quality settings we found (1) difficulties retaining effective staff and (2) a primary focus on basic services and managing crises, but less attention to emotional support, exacerbated by (3) funding and other challenges emerging from the larger environment.

How to improve the well-being of homeless girls: an exploratory study,"Castaños-Cervantes, Susana; Aguilar-Villalobos, Javier","Worldwide, homeless girls are a highly vulnerable group. They suffer sexual exploitation and forced labor, discrimination, and social exclusion at a higher rate than the rest of the general population. They often present anxiety and depression, unassertiveness and emotion dysregulation, among other psychosocial characteristics. All of these factors negatively impact subjective well-being, further worsening their mental health. Subjective well-being has both immediate (mental health, health behaviors) and long-term, cumulative effects on health (physical health, mortality), representing opportunities for investment in population health. Despite the relevance of subjective well-being and its associated factors, there is scarce research on the plight of homeless girls in Mexico and Latin America, which leads to ineffective interventions, policy actions and to a diminished quality of life. This study was carried out to develop and test a path model of well-being in 240 Mexican homeless girls ages 6-23 years old. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, assertiveness and emotion regulation strategies were used as factors influencing subjective well-being. Results showed that symptoms of depression and functional emotion regulation strategies have a significant direct influence on subjective well-being. Symptoms of anxiety and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have an indirect influence on subjective well-being with symptoms of depression as the mediating variable. Assertiveness did not significantly influence well-being directly and indirectly. Functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have a positive significant correlation. Fit indexes obtained indicate an excellent adjustment to data. R square indicates that 38% of the variance in subjective well-being can be explained by this model. Hence, the current study provides unique findings in terms of a model of well-being through which it is possible to design and implement interventions that increase such well-being in order to promote healthier social and emotional developmental trajectories in homeless girls, especially in the context of Latin American cities.",2019,,Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies,14,1,63-75,2189047542,10.1080/17450128.2018.1557776,,#3163,Castaños-Cervantes 2019,,
Social Services Professionals' Views of Barriers to Supporting Homeless Noncustodial Fathers,"Rogers, Tiana N; Rogers, Charles R","Objective: To investigate barriers to service for homeless noncustodial fathers from the perspective of social service professionals who work directly to assist men with securing housing while meeting the demands of fatherhood. Background: The population of homeless fathers in the United States is increasing. Longitudinal studies show that although homeless noncustodial fathers and mothers face similar risk factors and barriers to services, research on minimizing risk factors and barriers for noncustodial fathers is limited compared with that for noncustodial mothers. Method: The sample included 7 administrators and 12 direct service professionals engaged with fathers transitioning from homelessness. Data were collected via face-to-face, semistructured interviews and analyzed using a qualitative inductive approach. Multiple-cycle coding was used to capture emerging themes. Results: Three major themes, encompassing emotional, relational, and systemic factors, emerged regarding participants' experiences serving homeless noncustodial fathers. Conclusion: Effective approaches to supporting fathers require empathy, relationship building, and collaboration between service providers and policymakers. Implications: Future policies and interventions should be based on input from direct service professionals and homeless noncustodial fathers themselves, with the aim of best supporting their efforts toward securing housing while meeting the demands of fatherhood.",2019,,Family Relations,68,1,39-50,2207063999,10.1111/fare.12345,,#3164,Rogers 2019,,
UTILIZATION OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND BIRTH CONTROL UPTAKE IN YOUTH WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS,"Nelon, Jordan, MPH; Garney, Whitney, PhD, MPH; Aparicio, Elizabeth, MSW, PhD; Phillips, Danielle, MSW; Wilson, Kelly, PhD; Garcia, Kristen, MPH; Anderson, Kent, CVM","Purpose: Within the U.S., 4.3% of 13-17-year old's and 12.5% of 18-25year old's experienced homelessness during the past year. Female homeless youth become pregnant at a rate five times greater than that of the general U.S. population, with nearly half becoming pregnant at least once during adolescence. Developing trusted, healthy relationships is a challenge for youth who are homeless. Networks can represent a potentially diverse groups of people who provide tangible or intangible resources to the individual, but also may encourage engagement in unhealthy or risky behavior. This exploratory study examines implementation data from a teen pregnancy prevention program to better understand how homeless youth social networks share information and how that information can impact the uptake of birth control. Methods: To measure interpersonal relationships, we used a social network analysis (SNA) to assess the quality and strength of peer relationships. SNA is an ideal technique for this study because the study population is part of a bounded network defined by program participation. Eleven 14 to 18 years old participants took part in this study. Most participants were sexually active (n=9) and had first engaged in consensual sex at 13 to 18 years (M=15 years) of age. None of the participants were using birth control before the program. Data were collected through interviews and participants were asked which peers in the program they knew, who they trusted, and if they shared (or received) information on birth control. Data was symmetrized and density and centrality statistics were analyzed. Results: At the end of the program, 73% of the network participants were on some type of birth control at one-month follow-up. However, network density showed that only 14.3% of the network shared information about birth control. To understand if one or a few people controlled the information, centralization was analyzed on birth control information sharing. The whole network centralization was 0.339. This means that the sharing information network was centralized (> than 0.25). Degree centrality was then examined to understand who controlled information flow. One participant had a degree of 8 ties and four others had a degree of 5 ties each. Four of these 5 participants adopted some form of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) by the end of the program. One person was using condoms. Conclusions: While overall network density was not very high, centralization was significant which means that a few key players controlled the information flow. The majority of these individuals (4 of 5) adopted LARC by the end of the program, which may indicate that the information they shared with their peers about birth control influenced other youth's decisions on adoption. This exploratory study expands the limited research on the impact of social support on homeless youth and pregnancy prevention. 73% birth control utilization, one-month post-intervention, among a high-risk subpopulation that was not previously on birth control represents important findings for research on homeless youth.",2019,,Journal of Adolescent Health,64,2S,,2188166763,,,#3165,Nelon 2019,,
UTILIZATION OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND RELATIONSHIPS IN PROGRAM MEASURES FOR YOUTH WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS,"Nelon, Jordan L, MPH; Garney, Whitney, PhD, MPH; Aparicio, Elizabeth, MSW, PhD; Patterson, Megan, PhD, MPH; Kachingwe, Olivia, MPH; Wilson, Kelly, PhD; Garcia, Kristen, MPH","Purpose: Youth homelessness is a severe problem in the United States, wherein 4.3% of 13-17-year olds and 12.5% of 18-25-year olds experienced homelessness in the past year. Compared to the general U.S. population, homeless female youth are five times more likely to become pregnant. Limited research exists about the social networks of homeless youth, which can provide access to resources and information, as well as influence behaviors. The current study was designed to better understand social network properties among homeless female youth as they participated in a teen pregnancy prevention program. Methods: The study used a social network analysis (SNA) to assess the quality and strength of relationships between program participants. SNA was an ideal technique because the study population was part of a network bounded by program participation. 11 participants (n=11) took part in data collection who were 14 to 18 years old. Most participants were sexually active (n=9) and first engaged in consensual sex at 13 to 18 years (M=15 years) of age. None of the participants were using birth control before the start of the program. To illustrate the connections among our sample, we created three unique networks. This was achieved by giving participants a roster of everyone in the study and asking who they knew (closeness), if they trusted them (trust), and if they shared information about sexual health. Quadratic assignment procedures (QAP) correlation analyses compared closeness and trust networks with the information sharing network, revealing how similar connections were between networks. QAPs are permutation tests that analyze bivariate correlations between two or more networks. Results: At the end of the program, there was a 73% uptake of birth control at the one-month post. QAP correlations revealed that trust was positively, but weakly associated with sharing information about sexual health (QAP r= 0.36, p=.008). QAP correlations also indicated that sharing information about sexual health was not associated with the closeness or knowing the other participants (QAP r=0.007, p=.157). Lastly, QAP correlation analysis showed that closeness was weakly and negatively associated to trust in other participants (QAP r=-0.114, p=.056). Conclusions: Results show the trust network and the information sharing network were significantly correlated in our sample, suggesting homeless, female youth are more likely to share information about sexual health to the people they trust, but not necessarily to those they are close to. Further, the closeness and trust networks were negatively correlated, indicating youth did not trust those they were closest to. While we expected trust and information sharing networks to be correlated, the negative correlation between trust and closeness was surprising. A gap between closeness and trust could be because homeless youth tend to be hurt or ostracized by previous close relationships, or because they are protective of themselves and their belongings, inhibiting trust to formulate when people get too close. Future research could further examine this social phenomenon in our population and result in better health programming and interventions for homeless youth.",2019,,Journal of Adolescent Health,64,2S,,2188164861,,,#3166,Nelon 2019,,

This study examined data from a pilot Housing First program that served 78 families (n = 63) and single young adults (n = 15) with homeless histories and mental health and/or substance use disorders to explore program functioning and client service use patterns. Using an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011), qualitative interview data were conducted first, and quantitative administrative data and qualitative progress note data were then analyzed to explore ideas presented in the qualitative interviews. The in-depth qualitative interviews with staff (N = 9) collected information on program functioning and client successes and challenges. Quantitative data were collected on all 78 clients and sources included administrative data about return to homelessness, child welfare involvement, receipt of public assistance, and interactions with case managers. Qualitative exploration of a sample of client progress notes (N = 32) then followed. Integrating the findings, interviews suggested that clients faced many challenges, especially those related to having little to no income, multiple children, and stigmas, but that “success” would be indicated by needing their case managers less over time.

Psychosocial risk behaviors in Mexican young women experiencing homelessness,"Castaños-Cervantes, Susana; Vélez-Agosto, Nicole M","Psychosocial risk behaviors in young women experiencing homelessness include substance use and abuse, risky sexual activity and delinquent behaviors. These behaviors negatively impact well-being and diminish quality of life. The purpose of this study was to analyze from a qualitative perspective based on Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior, a series of psychosocial risk behaviors among a group of 200 Mexican young women experiencing homelessness ages 11 to 20 years old. The participants were selected with a purposive sampling method. Main results showed that social environmental predisposing factors for substance use and abuse, sexual risk behavior, and delinquent activities, included peer's and couple's behaviors, peer initiation of psychosocial risk-taking behaviors, and social pressure. Psychological predisposing factors for substance use and abuse included sensation-seeking and risk perception. The clinical implications of the study highlight the need to consider these social and psychological predisposing factors for psychosocial risk behaviors when designing efficient and sustainable interventions aimed to diminish and prevent these behaviors in young women experiencing homelessness, particularly in the context of Latin American cities.",2018,,Children and Youth Services Review,95,,235,2187119534,10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.10.041,,#3170,Castaños-Cervantes 2018,,
Transition to adult life of young people leaving foster care: A qualitative systematic review,"Häggman-Laitila, Arja; Salokekkilä, Pirkko; Karki, Suyen","The transition to adult life of looked-after young people depends on a combination and interaction of multiple contributing factors such as past experiences, challenges faced by the young people in their current life situation, the support they have received and their personal strengths. Several reviews and studies have reported of poor outcomes for care leavers and indicate that this is a worldwide phenomenon. A lower level of support in the transition process increases the risk for social exclusion, homelessness, unemployment, low education, financial difficulties and behavioral problems. The aim of this review was to gather, assess and synthesize the current empirical evidence of transition to adult life from the perspective of young people leaving foster care. A systematic review was conducted in six scientific databases to identify relevant qualitative studies published from 2010 to 2017, and 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the checklist for qualitative studies of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (2017). Data were analyzed using a narrative method. Care leavers had two views of their transition to adult life. The views differed clearly based on the care leavers' experiences of their capabilities, emotions and identity. The care leaving process was described as an unprepared and unfocused process which provided the care leavers no opportunities for participating in the decision-making concerning their future. The young people had acquired few survival skills for independent living in aftercare. Care leavers often lacked the support of family members, former care providers and institutional bodies. The challenges young people often faced during the transition to independent living were concerned with academic qualifications, housing problems, employment and financial instability, building relationships and assimilating to cultural norms, and access to health care. The results of the review can be utilized in the development of services and in designing future studies.",2018,,Children and Youth Services Review,95,,134,2187116801,10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.017,,#3171,Häggman-Laitila 2018,,
A paradigm shift in responding to children who have experienced trauma: The Australian treatment and care for kids program,"McPherson, Lynne; Gatwiri, Kathomi; Tucci, Joe; Mitchell, Janise; Macnamara, Noel","There is now considerable evidence to suggest that children placed in foster care experience greater levels of adversity compared to those in the general population. Early adversity has been shown to continue across the lifespan: those who have experienced the sustained trauma of threat or deprivation have a range of poor life outcomes including homelessness, poor mental health, and over-representation in the criminal justice system and low educational attainment. This paper reports on a study of a program response to children who have experienced trauma and are placed in out-of-home care. The program model, known as Treatment and Care for Kids (TrACK), introduced a paradigm shift in the treatment and care of children in Australia, in that it was designed to provide intensive, home-based therapeutic intervention for children presenting with complex trauma and challenging behaviours. This program sought to integrate knowledge about the neurobiology of trauma with therapeutic practice and care, reflecting growing recognition that ‘care is not enough’ to achieve holistic and effective healing for children who have experienced severe trauma. As such, the relationship that encircles the child was seen as the vehicle for recovery. The study examined client files and interviewed carers, key professionals and young people who had experienced the therapeutic care program since its inception 18 years ago. Data, informed by narrative inquiry methodology, were analysed. Key findings highlight the significance of relational practice to interrupt the projected trauma trajectory and for young people to stabilise and self-regulate.",2018,,Children and Youth Services Review,94,,525,2167806172,10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.031,,#3172,McPherson 2018,,

We assessed feasibility of Feastworthy, a prepared meal delivery program for families in motel-shelters with meals made from surplus food from local colleges. We used pre-and post-program surveys and semi-structured interviews, comparing participating families with families in a nearby shelter. During the three-month pilot, Feastworthy delivered 4,875 meals to 38 families; 33 families participated in the study (20 intervention and 13 control). Families reported that the motel-shelter worsened their diet and health, and reported increased food security and healthier diets with Feastworthy. In difference-in-differences analyses, vegetable intake trended upward by 0.6 servings/day (p=.08) among participants relative to comparison-site individuals.

Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of women’s lives,"Walklate, Sandra","In 2007 Jayne Mooney observed that violence against women was a public anathema and a private commonplace all at the same time. In the decade since this observation was made it would not be hard to conclude that the situation remains the same despite the increasing public policy profile afforded to such violence(s). The purpose of this paper is to consider how and why such forceful observations can still be made and it will do so by reflecting on five inter-connected ongoing tensions for the community safety agenda in addressing violence against women. These tensions are: epistemic (who can know what); methodological (how things, like violence against women, can be known); conceptual (how to make sense of what we think we know); saliency (what variables count and when); policy (what can be done in the light of the foregoing issues); and global (the Northern bias ners, lovers, colleagues, co-workers. In these relationships women learn to deal with harassment, incest, violence, and rape over the course of their lives. These learningexperiences are not easily separable into a public and private domain. For example,the routine fears experienced by young mothers in Palestine, the associated surveil-lance of their bodies, and their resistance to such oppression reported by Shalhoub-Kevorkian (2015), stand in stark contrast to the blinkered vision of how and whenfear is experienced as articulated in criminal victimisation survey data. Thus thefeminist path offers an appreciation of women’s lives as differently and differentiallyinformed by the everydayness of ordinary fears. Importantly for community safetyagendas this demands acknowledging that women are just as likely to fear men thatthey know and with whom they live and/or are close to as they are strangers. This istelling advice for all those crime prevention and community safety initiatives want-ing to spend money on improved street lighting, or better lit car parks, comforting assuch initiatives might be. Importantly notions of who we might be afraid of are alsotied to who might be thought of as risky. So implicit to the myriad of work focusingon the fear of crime is also the concept of risk.O’Malley (2006: 49) has pointed out, ‘crime prevention has succeeded in marry-ing risk with a more traditional social and behavioural form of criminology by trans-lating the old causes of crime into risk factors’. This pre-occupation with risk factorsis evident from the local to the global illustrated by the adoption of the World HealthOrganisation’s ‘ecological model’ of violence into national violence prevention289Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of…programmes. This model assumes that violence can be prevented by reducing theviolent characteristics of individuals. However it also begs the questions; what doesviolence mean and who does what to whom? (Hester 2013). Indeed a further ques-tion might be: How is it possible to understand the risk factors of violent behaviourwhen arguably violence and the recourse to violence exist in the folds of everydaylife (to borrow a phrase from Das 2007). The problematic nature of these issues isparticularly well demonstrated by Shalhoub-Kevorkian (2003: 603), who, in dis-cussing femicide, asks;What is the alternative if her male adult ‘protector’ abuses her (sexually, emo-tionally, physically), and how can she speak about her abuse if she has neverlearned that it is possible to voice personal matters? How can she speak outwhen she knows that customs and cultural codes may be used to cause herdeath? How can she ask for help when her protectors might also be her ene-mies? …..What happens if the legal system supports her femicide?Under these kinds of conditions what counts as risk and who counts as risky arearguably quite differently informed than any identification of risk factors might leadus to believe. It is a view which also carries with it huge implications for under-standings of what counts as community and community safety when seen throughsuch a differently informed gendered and ethnicised lens (see also the work of Gilland Harrison 2016). Nevertheless the identification of risk factors has been a signifi-cant driver of policy interventions in the crime prevention field in relation to vio-lence against women and some of these risk factors have been derived from criminalvictimisation survey data.The ‘discovery’ of the repeated nature of criminal victimisation from criminalvictimisation survey data, especially in relation to intimate partner violence, hadan important effect on informing policy responses, especially policing responses tosuch violence. For example, initial responses in the UK ‘flagged’ such victims onpolice computer systems so that they could be dealt with appropriately. However,as Pease suggests in this issue, responding to the phenomenon of repeat victimisa-tion was quickly left behind. This happened as the risk assessment tools used in thecontext of multi-agency responses to violence against women became increasinglyaccepted as the preferred community-based response to such violence. Contem-porarily there is a wide range of risk assessment tools available, from the SpousalRisk Assessment Guide (SARA), the Propensity for Abusiveness Scale (PAS); to thePartner Abuse Prognostic Scale (PAPS) (all quoted in Hoyle 2008: 327). The DASHmodel is favoured by most police forces in the UK (Domestic Abuse, Stalking andHarassment, and Honour Based Violence). McCulloch et al. (2016) review a furthernine tools (including DASH) designed to inform responses to intimate partner vio-lence and used to assess the levels of risk judged to be present in individual cases.Some risk assessment practices endeavour to pay greater attention to the victim’svoice in the assessment process, and as Hoyle (2008: 332) observes, these typicallyinclude getting the victim to agree to ‘safety plans’ for which ‘victims are made indi-vidually accountable—in part, at least—for minimising the risk of further violence’.Simultaneously such plans fail to ‘take into consideration women’s own assessmentsof the danger they are in, independent of other risk factors, even though most studies290 S. Walklatesuggest it is highly predictive of serious domestic assault’ (ibid. 330; see also Camp-bell 2004; Heckert and Gondolf 2004).These observations reveal the tensions referred to above in relation to who canknow what and who is listened to as a consequence. Indeed there are multiple exam-ples of cases in which the failure to listen to women’s own voices appropriatelyresulted in their subsequent death and/or serious injury. The fact remains that thenumber of women murdered by their partners or ex-partners has remained unremit-tingly consistent over the last 20 years in England and Wales as well as elsewhere.From the Thurman Case in the USA in the early 1980s that led to the introduction ofmandatory arrest policies in cases of domestic violence, to the case of Kelly Thomp-son in Melbourne, Australia, in 2015 who was killed by her partner after 38 calls topolice over a 3-week period for breaches of intervention orders, little has changedin the capacity for policy responses to prevent these kinds of fatal outcomes. Themulti-agency community-based activities of MARAC’s (multi-agency risk assess-ment conferences) and the presence of IDVA’s (independent domestic violence advi-sors: in 2018 there were 815 such advisors in England and Wales) have made littleimpact on such fatal outcomes either. Of course, since 2008 much of the work inrelation to policing in general and responses to violence against women has beensubjected to the effects of the wider cuts in policing budgets as a result of austeritymeasures. Nevertheless, as Walklate (2018) has argued, the difficulties in engagingin meaningful risk assessment practices for at-risk victims in this arena amount toconceptual failure (Lewis and Greene 1978). Indeed the faulty theoretical founda-tions of risk on which these practices are actually built are now well established(Mythen 2014). Moreover, McCulloch et al. (2016: 58) state ‘there is a paucity ofempirical research evaluating the outcomes of [international] risk assessments…’,with Westmarland (2011:300–301) observing that the relationship between such riskassessment exercises and subsequent incidents of femicide is somewhat arbitrary.Taken together these problems comprise an inability to think about security througha gendered lens.Since the events of 11 September 2001 and like events since, it is possible toargue that the framing of community safety has become increasingly informedby questions of security. The UK Government’s PREVENT agenda has become acentral feature of these concerns in which the question of the relationship betweencommunity, crime, and crime prevention has become increasingly informed by thepotential or otherwise for radicalisation. Put specifically the concern with the pre-vention of violent extremism is one in which the security of the state has taken prec-edence over security as a local and/or individual sense of well-being (see amongstothers Walklate et al. 2017). This pre-occupation has had a number of telling effectsone of which is the extent to which the continuities between violence against womenand violent extremism, particularly ‘lone’ terrorist attacks (see Hamm and Spaij2017), have taken a back seat in the rush to target communities presumed to be arisk to national security. Lack of space dictates an inability to unwrap all of theissues that the question of security raises for community safety, but the failure toenvision communities as structured spaces in which some voices are heard and oth-ers not is an important one. Contemporarily policy agendas outside of communitycontrol can frame what safety might look like and for whom within communities.291Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of…This means that those who are not heard remain locked into very informal networksof support and control: some of which can work well, some of which do not. Honourkillings and forced marriage are perhaps two of the more contentious and contestedissues which serve to illustrate the bigger problem of the failure to think throughthe consequences of such policies for those who remain invisible in them. For thepurposes of the discussion here, this means taking account of gender. This leadsinto the more recent focus on the question of vulnerability in informing responses tocommunity safety.The concept of vulnerability has rarely been explored in its own right (Green2007), and a good deal of policy takes what might be called inherent vulnerabil-ity (that characterised by age, mental capacity, or physical ability) as the groundsfor special treatment. For Sparks (1982) vulnerability is not physical but rather isinformed by who is considered to be at risk and who is considered to be harmed bysuch risk. This is a view embraced by criminal victimisation surveys in which thedata gathered measure vulnerability by measuring who is at most risk from crimeand then linking those data with other information about who crime has the mostimpact on. The relationship between these two variables determines who is the mostvulnerable. However the most vulnerable are not always those positively targeted bypolicy particularly at the community level. The hierarchy of victimisation identifiedby Carrabine et al. (2004) illustrates this. At the bottom of this hierarchy would bethe homeless, the drug addict, the street prostitute: all those for whom their lifestylerenders them prone to victimisation (vulnerable but denied victim status), and nearerthe top would be the elderly female victim of violent crime (the least prone to suchcrime, but assumed to be vulnerable and readily assigned victim status). Contem-porarily the concept of vulnerability has increasingly informed policy and practice,explicitly in terms of who policy is directed towards (for example communities vul-nerable to the risk of radicalisation) and implicitly in terms of resource allocation(for example the assumed progression from low, medium to high risk in cases ofintimate partner violence when there is little evidence that such progression exists,see Johnson et al. 2017). Taken together, these issues point to the importance of therelationship between policy and saliency.Saliency, policy, and the globalRecently Kruttschnidt (2016) has reiterated the point that as yet still not enoughis known about when gender is the salient variable. Social lives are complicatedand it would be naïve to assume that any particular course of action, includingbeing a victim or a perpetrator of violence against women, was not equally com-plex. However under some circumstances it is known that gender does matter.The statistical evidence is for the most part irrefutable: it is predominantly menwho are violent towards women, and it is also the case that some women areviolent towards some men. How these data are read informs how such violenceis responded to. The intervention by Welch (2008) referenced above focuseddetailed attention on how understandings of who the perpetrators are and who thevictims are in community-based responses to domestic violence and illustrates292 S. Walklatethe importance of this issue. Thus the question of saliency and the extent towhich gender is considered the salient variable is deeply entrenched in the kind ofpolicy response which flows from the data.Contemporarily, in comparison with 1998, there has been a shift towards the termgender which is now commonly used by policy makers and practitioners (and indeedsome academics) as a substitute for sex. This shift assumes that this deals with thecontested nature of the relationship between sex and gender and in so doing erasesthe questions that a serious embrace of gender can pose. For example, it remains thecase that male-dominated criminal justice systems (which most still are) can and dohave an important impact on responding to gendered crimes like domestic violenceand rape (for both men and women as victims of these crimes). Similarly under-standing communities as gendered communities in policy terms still has some wayto travel in appreciating that the lived reality of communities looks different for men,women, and other groups who occupy different structural positions within a com-munity. Referring back to Genn’s (1988) profound observation of violence as ‘justpart of life’ aptly captures this policy dilemma. Recognising this dilemma requiresmore than simply substituting the term gender for sex. An appreciation of structurallocation serves also to remind us that in this arena, like many others, criminal justicepolicies travel, not just from one locality to another but also globally and the direc-tion of that travel is more often than not from the global north to the global south.This paper has referred to this phenomenon in relation to violence against womenusing Goodmark’s (2015) label of ‘exporting without a licence’. This conveys muchthat is contentious in the policy transfer process. On the one hand exportation mightserve to problematise behaviour previously considered unproblematic. For example,campaign groups in some European countries have used the Istanbul Convention(which became effective in 2014) to assert pressure on their governments to takeviolence against women seriously. On the other hand those same processes can alsoerase and silence the issues of location, specificity, and cultural difference. Fitz-Gib-bon and Walklate (2017) have subjected Clare’s law (the Domestic Violence Dis-closure Scheme introduced in England and Wales in 2014) and the pro-arrest stancetowards domestic violence as illustrative of both of this. Cunneen and Rowe (2015:15) point the finger at the epistemic violence done by the beliefs in the superior-ity of, what they call, Eurocentric thinking. This, they observe, has crucial conse-quences insofar as… Eurocentric domestic violence, law and policy imposed in Indigenous con-texts is often predicated on an incongruent ontological and epistemologicalreality – a reality based on the potential for autonomous and individualiseddecision makingAssuming a potential for ‘autonomous and individualised decision making’, whetherthat be for a woman living with coercive control in England and Wales, or for amember of an Indigenous community already labelled as risky in Australia, runsthrough the tensions discussed in this paper. All of which when taken together actas barriers to effective policy responses to crime prevention and community safety.Such barriers can assume a uniform and unified subject and object of interventionthe dangers of which are reflected in the conceptual failure discussed above.293Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of…Conclusion: The ongoing precarity of women’s livesLoader and Walker (2001) observed that our sense of security is deeply embed-ded in our relationships with others. For women living with violence this involvesa precarious existence between keeping themselves and their children safe inways that might demand they stay with the person who threatens them most. Thepolicy activity documented above represents a plethora of initiatives few of whichhave impacted upon this fundamental ‘truth’. The failure to commit to the kindof whole systems approach advocated by Wilson in 1983will continue to embedwomen’s lives in a precariousness which is often compounded by the policiesintended to support and help them. Perhaps the time is ripe for a Royal Commis-sion on Violence Against Women which could take a long hard look at what hasand has not worked over the last 20 years. Such a commission would need to taketo heart that for some (women) violence is ‘just part of life’ before any in-roadscould be made to render community safety an inclusive experience. So muchremains to be done both in how community safety is understood, the evidencebased on which such understandings are constructed, and the extent to whichgendered thinking informs both of these issues. Some in-roads have already beenmade on these questions (see for example the measurement work reported byWalby et al. 2016). There is more to do.Acknowledgements With thanks to the reviewers for their comments on an earlier version of thispaper, the faults that remain are my own.ReferencesCampbell, J. 2004.

“It’s Only a Game of Chance”: A Portrait of Gambling Among Street Children in Mumbai,"Kennedy, Saldanha; D’Souza Barnabe; Dakshayani, Madangopal","For street children in Mumbai, gambling is mostly a social and recreational activity. This study is based on data gathered from a survey of 70 youths aged 12 to 24, two focus groups, and participant observation. It offers glimpses into various facets of their gambling, including age patterns, games played, venues, and how group and street subculture strongly influence participation. Street children perceive gambling as a “game of chance,” implying it is a form of recreation, not to be taken seriously. Given the pervasiveness of gambling and the absence of other recreational and money-saving opportunities, there is a need to design educational and preventive interventions for street children.",2018,,Journal of Adolescent Research,33,6,699-724,2117638417,10.1177/0743558416684949,,#3175,Kennedy 2018,,

"Social Connectedness, Self-Efficacy, and Mental Health Outcomes Among Homeless Youth","Begun, Stephanie; Bender, Kimberly A; Brown, Samantha M; Barman-Adhikari Anamika; Ferguson, Kristin","Homeless youth frequently meet diagnosis criteria for depressive and/or substance use disorder(s). Although prior research has established that both social connectedness and self-efficacy buffer vulnerable youth’s adverse health outcomes, few studies have compared the potential of these protective factors on homeless youth’s mental well-being. The current study analyzes comparative effects of social connectedness and self-efficacy on meeting criteria for major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, and the co-occurrence of both disorders among a sample of 601 service-seeking homeless youth in Austin, Denver, and Los Angeles. Hierarchical logistic regressions indicate that while both social connectedness and self-efficacy constructs are valuable protective factors, social connectedness may offer greater utility, particularly in buffering against more complex mental health outcomes, such as the co-occurrence of depressive and substance use disorders.

Assessing levels of student nurse learning in community based health placement with vulnerable families: Knowledge development for future clinical practice,"Parry, Yvonne K; Hill, Pauline; Horsfall, Susan","BackgroundCommunity services work with vulnerable families to assist them to link with health, education and welfare services. Community placements provide nursing students with understandings of the health impacts of social circumstances on broad population's. Nurses provide health care for vulnerable populations so it is important for students to gain experience in dealing with various population groups in a variety of settings. Community placements can increase student confidence to provide care for all people in the acute care setting.ObjectivesThe research project explored the use of a community placement to assist nursing students in applying psychosocial theories to practice; determining the affect of nursing students to the community service; and if the learning achieved in the placement was applicable to their future nursing practice were also objectives of the research.DesignThe mixed methods design used placement suitability focused questionnaires, and student, staff and clinical supervisor one-to-one interviews.SettingsIn 2015 a community based homelessness service which provides a home visiting service approached the School of Nursing and Midwifery to provide a community placement for nursing students. The urban homelessness service caters for 350 homeless clients per month.ParticipantsEight second year nursing students and six fulltime homelessness staff, mainly social workers, participated in the surveys and interviews.MethodsNursing students were ‘buddied’ with a social worker and visited individuals and families recently placed in emergency housing. The student nurses (8) and homelessness staff (6) were surveyed and interviewed about their knowledge, skills and perceptions about the value of community based placements.ResultsFindings indicate student's recognition of the skills to be learned in a non-acute setting are applicable to all clinical settings and enhance student knowledge and potential future care. The staff in the homelessness service espouse the enhancement provided by the expertise of the nursing students working with vulnerable populations. This paper highlights the benefits as perceived by students on often undervalued community based placements.ConclusionsIt is essential that universities collaborate with industry and consumers to ensure that the undergraduate programs offer a high standard of care and address current trends in the health care industry.

Study design: This is a systematic mapping review. Methods: Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005–2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10–24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, ‘looked after’, carers). Results: Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups.

IPV Survivors’ Perceptions of How a Flexible Funding Housing Intervention Impacted Their Children,"Bomsta, Heather; Sullivan, Cris M","An estimated 15.5 million American children are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) every year. Such exposure negatively impacts children’s health, development and academic performance and may also be accompanied by housing instability or homelessness. Children growing up with periods of homelessness or housing instability are at risk for many of the same detrimental outcomes as children exposed to IPV. To date there are few studies examining the interrelationships among IPV, housing instability and the impact of housing interventions on children’s well-being. The current qualitative, longitudinal study examined mothers’ perceptions of how receipt of flexible funding designed to increase their housing stability may have also impacted their children’s safety, stress, mood and behavior. Forty-two mothers in the Washington, D.C. metro area were interviewed three times over a six-month period about their own safety and housing stability, as well as their children’s. Ninety-five percent of the mothers and their children were housed at the six-month interview. Mothers described improvements in children’s stability and safety, decreases in children’s stress levels, and improvements to their mood and behavior. They also discussed the symbiotic relationship between their own stress and well-being, and their children’s. The provision of flexible funding to assist domestic violence survivors with their housing also collaterally impacted their children’s safety, stress, mood and behavior.",2018,,Journal of Family Violence,33,6,371-380,2048816222,10.1007/s10896-018-9972-5,,#3183,Bomsta 2018,,

Feasibility of ecological momentary assessment to study mood and risk behavior among young people who inject drugs,"Mackesy-Amiti, Mary E; Boodram, Basmattee","Aims To test the acceptability and feasibility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of mood and injection risk behavior among young people who inject drugs (PWID), using mobile phones. Methods Participants were 185 PWID age 18–35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15 days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day. Results Participants were 68% male, 61% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, and 5% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8% (n = 15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76% (n = 130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18–1.93). Homeless participants responded on fewer days (IRR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.90) and completed fewer surveys (IRR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.91), and were less likely to return for follow-up (p = 0.016).

On the transformation of children at-risk into an investment proposition: A study of Social Impact Bonds as an anti-market device,"Neyland, Daniel","Following the financial crisis of 2008, the UK government accelerated a number of market-based interventions into public problems. Experimenting with new forms of intervention provided a moment to effectively problematize the public sector as a whole and its budgets, opening up for discussion the basis for making an intervention, and the methods and costs involved. Questions were posed of the apparently irreducible costs associated with supposedly intractable problems of government (such as homelessness, vulnerable children or crime). In particular, crisis and austerity became a means to give new momentum to a series of experimental ways to shape the social investment market that had been under discussion in various forms since at least 2000. Social Impact Bonds form one particular type of intervention. They involve drawing together investors with delivery agencies, the third sector and national and local government, coordinated by a commissioner. In the recent move by the UK government to set up and use Social Impact Bonds, much has been made of the opportunity they represent to introduce competition, efficiency, efficacy, private sector thinking and investment to a range of different social problems. As the first results of these experiments are now emerging, this article reports on a study conducted into a market-based intervention that experiments with the transformation of ‘children at-risk’ into an investment proposition through a Social Impact Bond. The article suggests that the Social Impact Bond can be usefully explored by drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS) treatments of markets as collective, heterogeneous assemblages. However, in contrast to scholars who focus on market devices, the article argues that the Social Impact Bond in practice operates as something akin to an anti-market device. The article begins with an introduction to Social Impact Bonds. It then explores the means through which market-based competition and an investment proposition were anticipated, but did not emerge through the composition and enactment of the Bond. It concludes with an assessment of the anti-market device and the future of Social Impact Bonds.",2018,,The Sociological Review,66,3,492-510,2024918102,10.1177/0038026117744415,,#3189,Neyland 2018,,
"Outcomes of the “STEPS” HIV prevention training program for young males in the penitentiary institution, Ukraine","Dauria, Emily; Tolou-Shams Marina; Skipalska Halyna; Bachmaha Mariya; Hodgdon, Sara","PurposeUkraine has one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics globally. Due to their engagement in high-risk behaviors, adolescents and emerging adults involved with the penitentiary system are at a particularly high risk of HIV-acquisition. To address the epidemic, young males (aged 14 to 20 years) in penitentiary institutions across Ukraine participated in a ten-week, group-based HIV-prevention intervention (STEPS). The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachThe authors analyzed clinical and programmatic services data collected as part of an evaluation of the STEPS intervention. Paired t-tests and χ2 were used to examine pre- and post-intervention differences in HV knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors and alcohol and other drug use knowledge.FindingsIn total, 105 male youths participated in the ten-session STEPS intervention. At baseline, males reported high frequencies of risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sexual activity, injection drug use), moderate levels of HIV-related knowledge, and negative attitudes toward HIV and people living with HIV. At follow-up (immediately following the last STEPS session), participants’ HIV-related knowledge substantially improved and participants tended to have more favorable attitudes toward HIV.Research limitations/implicationsOutcomes suggest that knowledge and attitudes about HIV among Ukrainian incarcerated youth can improve as a result of group-based HIV-prevention intervention.Originality/valueIn Ukraine, individuals involved with the criminal justice system are one of the populations most-at-risk for HIV; criminal justice-involved adolescents and young adults are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic.

Security and the Traumatized Street Child: How Gender Shapes International Psychiatric Aid in Cairo,Rania Kassab Sweis,"It is ten o'clock on a sunny and unusually chilly January morning in Cairo, Egypt. Young Amir and Hassan slouch lazily in uncomfortable plastic chairs positioned next to me. We are waiting in the entryway of Dr. Mona's enormous and high‐ceilinged psychiatric clinic. The office is funded by a French‐based international organization I will refer to hereafter as Children's Charity International (CCI). This transnational organization services those deemed most vulnerable in society, especially women and children. In Egypt, their projects primarily center on the health and welfare of adfāl al shawāri’ (street children)—a category the organization and the Egyptian state define as the country's most vulnerable and at‐risk population. While CCI policy defined street children as a singular ungendered category possessing what I refer to as a “universal young humanity”—all children suffer in the same biological ways with the same effects—this article explores what I observed as a markedly gendered distribution of humanitarian psychiatric care among a small group of street children in Cairo. Specifically, I explore how, at CCI, boys were more likely to be designated as threatening or unstable child subjects and therefore in need of psychiatric or psycho–pharmaceutical intervention than girls who generally avoided this medicalized categorization.

Identifying health policy and systems research priorities for the sustainable development goals: social protection for health,"Qiu, Mary; Jessani, Nasreen; Bennett, Sara","Background There is an established body of evidence linking systems of social protection to health systems and health outcomes. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide further emphasis on this linkage as necessary to achieving health and non-health goals. Existing literature on social protection and health has focused primarily on cash transfers. We sought to identify potential research priorities concerning social protection and health in low and middle-income countries, from multiple perspectives.MethodsPriority research questions were identified through two sources: 1) research reviews on social protection interventions and health, 2) interviews with 54 policy makers from Ministries of Health, multi-lateral or bilateral organizations, and NGOs. Data was collated and summarized using a framework analysis approach. The final refining and ranking of the questions was completed by researchers from around the globe through an online platform.ResultsThe overview of reviews identified 5 main categories of social protection interventions: cash transfers; financial incentives and other demand side financing interventions; food aid and nutritional interventions; parental leave; and livelihood/social welfare interventions. Policy-makers focused on the implementation and practice of social protection and health, how social protection programs could be integrated with other sectors, and how they should be monitored/evaluated. A collated list resulted in 31 priority research questions. Scale and sustainability of social protection programs ranked highest. The top 10 research questions focused heavily on design, implementation, and context, with a range of interventions that included cash transfers, social insurance, and labor market interventions.ConclusionsThere is potentially a rich field of enquiry into the linkages between health systems and social protection programs, but research within this field has focused on a few relatively narrowly defined areas. The SDGs provide an impetus to the expansion of research of this nature, with priority setting exercises such as this helping to align funder investment with researcher effort and policy-maker evidence needs.",2018,,International Journal for Equity in Health,17,,,2122741136,10.1186/s12939-018-0868-z,,#3194,Qiu 2018,,

STREET CHILDREN IN INDIA: A STUDY ON THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH AND EDUCATION,"Dutta, Nilika","Street life is a challenge for survival, even for adults, and is yet more difficult for children. They live within the city but are unable to take advantage of the comforts of urban life. This study focused primarily on access to health and education in street children from 6 to 18 years old in the Indian metropolises of Mumbai and Kolkata. The study also aimed to assess the role of social work interventions in ensuring the rights of street children. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies was used. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 100 children. Data were collected on a one-to-one basis through semi-structured interview schedules and by non-participant observation. Findings revealed that extreme poverty was the primary cause for the increasing numbers of street children. Lack of awareness among illiterate parents regarding educational opportunities kept most children away from school attendance. Factors such as lack of an educational ambience at home made it difficult for the children to work on their lessons outside the premises of the institution. It was evident that those living with their parents had better access to health care facilities than did those living on their own; however, nongovernmental organizations made significant efforts to redress this imbalance, setting up health check-up camps at regular intervals. Although exposure to harsh reality at an early age had resulted in a premature loss of innocence in most, making them sometimes difficult to work with, the nongovernmental organizations were striving to ensure child participation and the growth of individual identity. The interventionists therefore focused on developing a rights-based approach, rather than a charitable one.",2018,,"International Journal of Child, Youth & Family Studies",9,1,69-82,2018263751,10.18357/ijcyfs91201818120,,#3196,Dutta 2018,,

Implications for leaders in the field of EI, service delivery, systems change, and professional development are discussed.",2018,,Infants and Young Children,31,1,20,1989843356,,,#3197,Hurley 2018,,
Heterogeneous trajectories of suicidal ideation among homeless youth: Predictors and suicide-related outcomes.,"Wu, Qiong; Zhang, Jing; Walsh, Laura; Slesnick, Natasha","The current study examined heterogeneous trajectories of suicidal ideation among homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation over 9 months in a randomized controlled intervention study. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their suicidal ideation four times during a 9-month period. We also assessed pretreatment mental health, demographic information and session attendance as predictors of the subgroups, as well as suicide-related factors as outcomes at the 9-month follow-up. Growth mixture models suggested three distinct trajectory groups among youth: Fast Declining (74.7%), Chronic (19.3%), and Steadily Declining (6.0%). Youth in the Chronic group used more substances at baseline than the Steadily Declining group, were more likely to be White, non-Hispanic than the Fast Declining group, and attended more CTSP sessions than other groups. Contrastingly, youth in the Steadily Declining group all experienced childhood abuse. Finally, youth in the Chronic group showed significant higher risk for future suicide compared to those in the Fast Declining group at 9 months. Findings support the heterogeneity of treatment responses in suicide intervention among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts in this very high-risk population.

The second national Canadian homeless youth survey: Mental health and addiction findings.,"Kidd, Sean A.; Gaetz, Stephen; O'Grady, Bill; Schwan, Kaitlin; Zhao, Haoyu; Lopes, Katrini; Wang, Wei","Objective: Youth experiencing homelessness represent a major social problem in Canada and, as demonstrated in the first national survey of this population conducted in 2015, are experiencing significant mental health challenges. The present study examines the findings of a second national survey completed in 2019. These findings afford the opportunity to examine the reliability of the findings of the first study with another large, representative sample and to attempt to articulate the unique characteristics of youth experiencing the greatest distress among this at-risk population. Methods: This study analyzed the mental-health-related data from the 2019 Without a Home–National Youth Homelessness Survey that was administered through convenience sampling at 98 agencies serving homeless youth in 49 communities across Canada. The survey was cross-sectional and self-administered, assessing a range of demographic information, pre- and post-homelessness variables, and mental health indicators. Multinomial logistic regression and linear regression were implemented to evaluate associations with distress level. Results: Survey data were obtained from 1,375 youth accessing Canadian homeless services in 9 provinces. Thirty-five percent reported at least 1 suicide attempt, and 33.1% reported a drug overdose requiring hospitalization. The findings of this survey replicated most of the key findings from the 2015 survey. The current findings emphasized, for this high-risk population, the heightened adversity faced by young women, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S), and Indigenous subpopulations, as well as the centrality of violence exposure in determining risk and distress. Sexual violence, in particular, emerged as a key factor in the identification of youth experiencing the greatest distress with risk buffered by contact with family. Conclusions: These findings can inform prevention and intervention policies and services and reinforce the importance of attending to violence exposure and trauma as central to the mental health trajectories of youth who have experienced homelessness.

Residential social drift in the two years following a first episode of psychosis.,"Pignon, Baptiste; Eaton, Scott; Schürhoff, Franck; Szöke, Andrei; McGorry, Patrick; O'Donoghue, Brian","This study aimed to determine the prevalence of residential mobility, specifically social drift amongst a cohort of young people with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) followed-up two years after the initial presentation. Secondarily, this study aimed to determine sociodemographic and clinical predictors of residential social drift. The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) is an Early intervention in psychosis service within Orygen Youth Health. It covers a catchment area of 59 postcodes within the Australian state of Victoria (Northern and Western . It is a disadvantaged area, with high levels of social deprivation and social fragmentation. All young people with a FEP aged 15 to 24 years-old, living in the catchment area and attending the EPPIC service between 2011 and 2013, were included in the study. A total of 527 young people presented with a FEP during the study period, and follow-up information was available for 97.9% (N = 516). At follow-up, six people were homeless, and five had been incarcerated. Thirty-four people had moved outside Victoria state. Therefore, 471 young people remained in Victoria (mean age: 19.5 years; 60.3% male). Of the cohort, 22.7% were first-generation migrants to Australia. At the time of presentation, 47.9% had a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and 27.4% had an affective psychotic disorder. Substance use was common in the cohort, with 58.4% having a history of cannabis use, and 24.0% with a history of amphetamine use. The median duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was 8.0 weeks (mean: 27.1 weeks). This study found that only a small minority experienced a residential social drift in the two years following the initial presentation with a FEP. Migrants were more likely to experience a social drift, while those with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were less likely to experience social drift. The young people included in this study were more likely to be residing in areas of higher social deprivation at the time of presentation and this study has demonstrated that approximately 12% of the total cohort experienced residential social drift. This indicates that the social causation theory and social drift theory likely work in unison, however social causation may be more pertinent for younger people.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2022-51900-001). Traditionally, UK housing services have focused on providing temporary accommodation, identifying risk factors, and preventing negative outcomes to young people experiencing homelessness. However, deficit approaches may lead young people to becoming dependent on services and face greater marginalization and stigmatization. Meeting long-standing calls to focus more on young people’s positive attributes and abilities, the My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) program was developed as a community partnership with a large housing service. This paper describes the rationale, logic model, and content of the MST4Life™ program using the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist. MST4Life™ is a strengths-based and experiential psychoeducation intervention for young people aged 16–24 years who are homeless or at risk. Grounded in positive youth development and basic psychological needs theory, its aim is to provide meaningful opportunities for participants to recognize, use, and further develop their mental skills and strengths. In turn, enhancing intentional self-regulation is expected to improve physical, mental, and social health and wellbeing, and support positive transitions to independent living. The potential long-term impacts include a reduction in the number of young people returning as homeless, lower rates of mental illness and mortality, and a cost saving to the public purse.

Substance abuse among children,"Aly, Sanaa M.; Omran, Ahmed; Gaulier, Jean-Michel; Allorge, Delphine","Substance abuse (SA) among children is a recognized challenge for policymakers and law enforcement and has life-threatening consequences owing to the impact on the children's development and the consequent increase in vulnerability. This work outlines several important issues related to SA among children: (1) SA prevalence including onset, common examples, extent, and spectrum of SA; (2) the presence of new psychoactive substances, which are rapidly spreading worldwide with limitations regarding their prevalence, detection, and interventions; (3) street children and their recruitment in drug supply; (4) SA and substance use disorder pathways, risk and protective factors for the development of SA; (5) SA consequences in the case of early initiation, including deaths; and (6) current preventive interventions for the pediatric population.

Adapting and Pilot Testing a Parenting Intervention for Homeless Families in Transitional Housing,"Holtrop, Kendal; Holcomb, Jamila E.","Intervention adaptation is a promising approach for extending the reach of evidence-based interventions to underserved families. One highly relevant population in need of services are homeless families. In particular, homeless families with children constitute more than one third of the total homeless population in the United States and face several unique challenges to parenting. The purpose of this study was to adapt and pilot test a parenting intervention for homeless families in transitional housing. An established adaptation model was used to guide this process. The systematic adaptation efforts included: (a) examining the theory of change in the original intervention, (b) identifying population differences relevant to homeless families in transitional housing, (c) adapting the content of the intervention, and (d) adapting the evaluation strategy. Next, a pilot test of the adapted intervention was conducted to examine implementation feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility data indicate an intervention spanning several weeks may be difficult to implement in the context of transitional housing. Yet, acceptability of the adapted intervention among participants was consistently high. The findings of this pilot work suggest several implications for informing continued parenting intervention research and practice with homeless families in transitional housing.",2018,,Fam Process,57,4,884-900,,10.1111/famp.12341,,#3203,Holtrop 2018,,
"Satisfaction with health and community services among homeless and formerly homeless individuals in Quebec, Canada","Gentil, Lia; Grenier, Guy; Bamvita, Jean Marie; Fleury, Marie-Josée","User satisfaction is a crucial quality indicator in health service provision. Few studies have measured user satisfaction among homeless and formerly homeless individuals, despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders (MHD) in this population. The purpose of this study was to assess overall satisfaction among 455 homeless and formerly homeless individuals who were receiving health and community services, and to identify factors associated with user satisfaction. Data collection occurred between January and September 2017. Study participants were 18 years old or over, with experience of homelessness in the current or recent past. They completed a questionnaire eliciting socio-demographic information, and data on residential history, service use and satisfaction and health profiles. Multivariate linear analysis was performed on overall satisfaction with health and community services in the previous 12 months. Independent variables were organised as predisposing, enabling and needs factors based on the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model. The mean satisfaction score was 4.11 (minimum: 1; maximum: 5). Variables associated with greater user satisfaction included: older age, residence in permanent housing, common MHD (e.g., depression, anxiety), having a family physician, having a case manager, strong social network, good quality of life and, marginally, male sex and having substance use disorders (SUD). By contrast, frequent users of public ambulatory health services were the most dissatisfied. User satisfaction was more strongly associated with enabling factors. Strategies for improving satisfaction include: promoting more tailored primary care programmes (including family physician) adapted to the needs of this population, better integrating primary care with specialised services including SUD integrated treatment and enhancing continuity of care through the reinforcement of case management services. Further efforts aimed at increasing access to permanent housing with supports, and eliciting more active involvement by relatives and friends may also improve user satisfaction with services, and reduce unnecessary service use.",2020,,Health Soc Care Community,28,1,22-33,,10.1111/hsc.12834,,#3204,Gentil 2020,,
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Regarding HIV and TB Among Homeless People in Tehran, Iran","Bagheri Amiri, Fahimeh; Doosti-Irani, Amin; Sedaghat, Abbas; Fahimfar, Noushin; Mostafavi, Ehsan","BACKGROUND: Homeless people are at high risk of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) infection due to living in poor sanitary conditions and practicing high-risk behavior. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of homeless people in Tehran regarding TB and HIV.METHODS: Using a convenience sampling, we performed a cross-sectional study on homeless people in Tehran from June to August 2012. Participants aged 18-60 years having at least 10 days of homelessness in the preceding month to the study period were included. All required data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted using a researcherdesigned questionnaire. Each score in KAP of TB and HIV was separately divided by the maximum score and multiplied by 100 to attain percentage scores. The mean scores were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and student's t test. A Tukey test was used for post hoc analysis and two-by-two comparisons.RESULTS: In this study, 593 participants consisting of 513 men and 80 women were included. The mean age of the participants was 41.74 ± 0.45 years. Moreover, the total mean score of KAP toward HIV was 79.24 (95% CI: 77.36, 81.12), 57.13 (95% CI: 55.12, 59.14), and 21.14 (95% CI: 18.35, 23.93), respectively.

[Formula: see text] Relationship of parent-rated and objectively evaluated executive function to symptoms of posttraumatic stress and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in homeless youth,"Lafavor, Theresa; Gimbel, Blake; Olsen, Aarika; Travis, Alicia; Weber, Rachel","Compared to their stably housed peers, homeless, and highly mobile (HHM) youth experience disproportionately greater adversity and risk leading to a wide variety of poor developmental outcomes, and targeted interventions have the potential to mitigate such outcomes. A growing literature highlights the need for accurate diagnosis in high-risk populations given the considerable overlap between posttraumatic symptomology and behaviorally based disorders such as ADHD. Objective testing inferring neurobiological and circuit-based abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and ADHD may provide a useful clinical tool to aid accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations. This novel, exploratory study examined the relation between executive function (EF) as measured by objective testing and parent ratings with symptoms of posttraumatic stress and ADHD in 86 children (age 9 to 11) living in emergency homeless shelters. Parent-rated EF problems suggested broad impairment associated with ADHD symptoms but specific impairment in emotional/behavioral function associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms. While measures of inhibition and shifting EF were strongly associated with symptomology in bivariate correlations, they explained minimal variance in regression models. Internalizing behavior problems were associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms, while externalizing behavior problems were associated with ADHD symptoms. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",2022,,Child Neuropsychol,28,6,768-790,,10.1080/09297049.2021.2016671,,#3206,Lafavor 2022,,

Feasibility and acceptability of an intervention for enhancing reintegration in adults with experience of homelessness,"Sundin, Eva C.; Mrowiec, Aleksandra; Bowpitt, Graham; Boatman, Charlotte A.; Williams, A. J.; Sarkar, Mustafa; Baguley, Thom S.","BACKGROUND: Service centres for homeless adults are potential settings for implementation of reintegration interventions. This study aimed to evaluate (i) the acceptability of a group-based programme among individuals from the broad population of homeless people and (ii) if a future study of its feasibility and acceptability for re-housed homeless people is warranted.METHODS: Recruiting participants and intervention facilitators from partnering service centres was thought to improve recruitment and retention, cost-effectiveness and social interactions compared to professional-led interventions. Seven adults with experience of homelessness (three females, four males, mean age 39 years, range 18-63) were recruited to participate in the intervention. The research protocol comprised completion pre/post of scales [Recovering Quality of Life questionnaire; Working Alliance Inventory-short form revised (WAI-SR)] and focus groups, and WAI-SR and focus groups after sessions 3 and 6.RESULTS: The intervention and research protocols were feasible, with all participants engaging in all sessions, completing all scales and attending all focus groups. The quantitative data demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining practically useful measures of relevant outcomes. In the four focus groups, the intervention received very favourable feedback.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated initial feasibility and acceptability of an intervention that places minimal burden on infrastructure and promotes user autonomy.

Homeless youth are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress, substance use and mental disorders, and premature mortality caused by suicide and drug overdose. However, their access to and use of mental health care is very limited.METHODS: The Réseau d'intervention de proximité auprès des jeunes (RIPAJ), a Montreal network of over 20 community stakeholders providing a wide array of cohesive services, was created to ease homeless youth's access to mental health and psychosocial services. Its philosophy is that there should be no ""wrong door"" or ""wrong timing"" for youth seeking help. In 2014, the network partnered with the pan-Canadian transformational research initiative, ACCESS Esprits ouverts.RESULTS: Created through this partnership, ACCESS Esprits ouverts RIPAJ has been promoting early identification through outreach activities targeting homeless youth and agencies that serve them. An ACCESS Clinician was hired to promote and rapidly respond to help-seeking and referrals. By strengthening connections within RIPAJ and using system navigation, the site is working to facilitate youth's access to timely appropriate care and eliminate age-based transitions between services. A notable feature of our program, that is not usually evident in homelessness services, has been the engagement of the youth in service planning and design and the encouragement of contact with families and/or friends.CONCLUSION: Challenges remain including eliminating any remaining age-related transitions of care between adolescent and adult services; and the sustainability of services transformation and network coordination. Nonetheless, this program serves as an example of an innovative, much-needed, community-oriented model for improving access to mental health care for homeless youth.",2019,,Early Interv Psychiatry,13 Suppl 1,Suppl Suppl 1,20-28,,10.1111/eip.12814,,#3210,Abdel-Baki 2019,,
Digital micro-banking as a health and protection intervention for street-connected children and youth? Analysis from a Togolese pilot,"Howard, Neil","BACKGROUND: The SaVa pilot offered street-connected children and youth (C&Y) access to digital micro-banking services to help them save money and thus avoid the violence associated with theft at night. It further used the micro-banking service as a gateway to attract C&Y towards other health and protection services. It took place over 12 months in Lomé, Togo and involved one social worker (SW) plus volunteers running 'the bank' in a non-governmental organisation-funded drop-in centre.METHODS: C&Y peer researchers were trained to interview and use collective drawing with peers, which they did on a bi-monthly basis. The SW recorded information about case management, training and additional services offered. He administered a survey to C&Y at the point of entry into the project and after 1 year, asking questions about recent experiences of violence or theft. At the end of 12 months, the author conducted interviews with C&Y using the bank, C&Y researchers who used the bank, project staff and steering committee partners and child protection stakeholders. One focus group was conducted with C&Y participants, alongside limited participant observation of where C&Y sleep and work.RESULTS: Findings suggest that the intervention was successful in encouraging children to open accounts and save money, and in contributing to a reduction in theft and associated violence. The incidence of theft reduced 90%; 95% of C&Y account holders were happy with the service; 200 accounts were opened. The project supported the delivery of additional services, including counselling, school reinsertion and removal from the streets.CONCLUSIONS: Analysis suggests that it is possible to offer street-connected C&Y formal financial services but that this offer has potential as a health and protection intervention, especially in combination with the provision of a safe space, dedicated SW support and add-on services.",2024,,BMJ Paediatr Open,8,1,e002423,,10.1136/bmjpo-2023-002423,,#3211,Howard 2024,,
"Change in Housing Status among Homeless and Formerly Homeless Individuals in Quebec, Canada: A Profile Study","Kaltsidis, Gesthika; Grenier, Guy; Cao, Zhirong; Fleury, Marie-Josée","Housing stability is a key outcome in studies evaluating housing services for the homeless population. Housing stability has typically been defined dichotomously and based on a fixed duration of maintenance in housing accommodations, which does not fully capture change in housing status among homeless individuals. Moreover, few typologies have examined housing trajectories across different housing types. Cluster analysis was used to develop a typology of housing status change for 270 currently or formerly homeless individuals in Quebec (Canada) residing in shelters and temporary and permanent housing. Participants were interviewed at baseline (T0) and 12 months later (T1). The Gelberg-Andersen Model was used to organize housing-related variables into predisposing, needs and enabling factors. Comparison analyses were conducted to assess group differences. Three groups (Groups 1, 3 and 4) had more favorable and two (Groups 2 and 5) less favorable, housing status at T1. Findings suggest that maintenance or improvement of housing status requires suitable types and frequencies of service use (enabling factors) that are well adapted to the nature and complexity of health problems (needs factors) among homeless individuals.

Sex Trading Among Adolescent Cisgender Boys,"Martin, Lauren; McMorris, Barbara J.; Rider, G. Nic","OBJECTIVES: Cisgender girls and boys report trading sex for something of value at roughly equal proportions; yet, boys are understudied and underserved. We compare boys who reported trading sex to those who never traded sex to address this gap in knowledge and practice.METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of the Minnesota Student Survey, a triannual, census-style survey. The sample included 32 311 cisgender boy students in ninth and 11th grades who answered a question about sex trading. Bivariate descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic models were used to identify associated factors and determine the odds of trading sex on the basis of specific experiences.RESULTS: We found that 1.2% of boys reported trading sex. In bivariate analyses, boys who reported trading sex were more likely than those who did not to: identify as Black or Indigenous; report a marginalized gender identity or sexual expression; have had sexual intercourse; have experienced sexual harassment and harassment on the basis of sexual identity and race, ethnicity, and national origin; and to have experienced homelessness, food insecurity, foster care, and substance treatment (P < .001). In multivariate models, we found increased odds of trading sex for some variables, including a marginalized sexual identity, identifying as Black, and experiences of unstable housing, foster care, substance treatment, sexual harassment, and harassment based on gender (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute new knowledge about boys who trade sex using a large, population-based sample and counter false assumptions and stereotypes.

Understanding street-exposure and abuse among street-involved children and youth in Kenya: structural intervention insights from routinely collected program data,"Goodman, Michael; Munene, Kelvin; Gardner, Nora; Gitari, Stanley","BACKGROUND: Street-involved children and youth (SICY) face significant challenges, including structural and social exclusion, and multiple forms of abuse. Global estimates indicate there are 10-15 million SICY worldwide, with over 250 000 in Kenya alone. There is limited understanding of the timing of these abuse experiences, which may inform interventional efforts.METHODS: This study analysed relationships between the duration of street exposure, sleep location and experiences of abuse among formerly SICY (aged 6-19 years) in Kenya. Data were collected from participants in the Watoto wa Ahadi Rescue Center programme over a 6-year period (2016-2022). Abuse experiences were categorised into physical, emotional, economic and sexual abuse. Statistical analyses, including Lowess-curve plots and piecewise logit regression, were used to explore the relationships between street exposure duration, sleep location and reported abuse experiences.RESULTS: The sample consisted of 228 unique children, predominantly male, with a mean age of 13.2 years. Physical abuse (37%), emotional abuse (36%), economic abuse (28%) and any abuse (69%) were common, while sexual abuse (5.7%) was less frequently reported. The probability of experiencing abuse varied with the duration of street exposure, with significant increases observed for those on the street for 3 weeks or more. Sleeping under verandas was associated with higher odds of economic abuse and any type of abuse. Longer street exposure did not further increase the odds of physical, economic or any abuse beyond 10 months.CONCLUSIONS: Children and youth living on the streets experience high levels of abuse, underscoring the need for data-informed, trauma-informed approaches to support their reintegration. The findings highlight the importance of early intervention and tailored strategies that address the specific timing and types of abuse experienced by SICY. Policy and funding should focus on preventing street migration, providing alternative living locations and supporting long-term reintegration efforts to protect and empower SICY.",2024,,BMJ Paediatr Open,8,1,e002957,,10.1136/bmjpo-2024-002957,,#3214,Goodman 2024,,
"Emergency Department Visits by Homeless Status and Sex: United States, 2016-2021","Schappert, Susan M.; Santo, Loredana","Objectives-This report describes emergency department (ED) visits by homeless status and sex. Methods-Nationally representative estimates were calculated from data collected in the 2016-2021 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual national probability sample survey of ED visits in the United States. Visits by people experiencing homelessness were defined using data on patient residence from medical records. Visits by males and females experiencing homelessness are compared with each other and with visits by males and females not experiencing homelessness. Results-During 2016-2021, approximately 981,000 and 460,000 ED visits were made annually by males and females experiencing homelessness, respectively. Significant differences by sex were found for this population for many ED visit characteristics, including arrival by ambulance, diagnoses, and chronic conditions. ED visits by males and females experiencing homelessness also differed significantly from ED visits by males and females not experiencing homelessness based on age, geographic region, expected source of payment, primary diagnosis, chronic conditions, and other characteristics. Conclusion-This report highlights certain differences by sex among the population experiencing homelessness who visited the ED and compares them with people who visited the ED but were not experiencing homelessness.",2024,,Natl Health Stat Report,,204,21-Jan,,,,#3215,Schappert 2024,,
Visual Impairment and Ocular Pathology Among the Urban American Homeless,"Henstenburg, Jeffrey; Thau, Avrey; Markovitz, Michael; Plumb, James; Markovitz, Bruce","INTRODUCTION: There are few studies that describe the prevalence of ocular morbidity among people who are homeless in the United States. The goal of this study was to describe rates of visual impairment and ocular pathology of men at a homeless shelter in a major United States city.METHODS: An ophthalmologist lead eye-screening clinic was established at a homeless shelter in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Results were obtained prospectively from 2015 to 2017.RESULTS: During the study period, 91 patients were enrolled. Visual impairment, defined as vision worse than 20/40, was identified in 42% and ocular pathology in 57% of those studied. This was higher than the national average and higher than or similar to international studies conducted in homeless shelters. Common findings included cataracts, glaucoma, and past eye trauma.CONCLUSION: This study describes a high rate of eye disease and refractive error in an urban homeless sample in the United States.",2019,,J Health Care Poor Underserved,30,3,940-950,,10.1353/hpu.2019.0066,,#3216,Henstenburg 2019,,
Primary care services tailored for adult and adolescent homeless persons: a scoping review protocol,"Djuric, Corinne M.; Vottero, Beth","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to explore existing literature on primary care services for adult and adolescent homeless persons, map the evidence and identify gaps in the literature.INTRODUCTION: Homeless adults and adolescents have complicated health needs, increased need for services, and more barriers to care. Recipients of primary care services use less emergency and urgent care resources. More information is needed in order to tailor primary care services for this vulnerable population.INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider studies with participants aged 13 years or older who are currently or previously homeless. Studies will be included regardless of type of primary care service, country of origin, healthcare delivery system, geographic location or cultural setting.METHODS: The proposed review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The search strategy aims to locate published and unpublished studies and will be adapted for each information source. The reference lists of selected studies will be screened for additional citations. The search will be limited to the English language, but not by date of publication. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, PsychArticles, PsycEXTRA, Academic Search Premier and Web of Science.

Mobile Apps for the Personal Safety of At-Risk Children and Youth: Scoping Review,"Bowen-Forbes, Camille; Khondaker, Tilovatul; Stafinski, Tania; Hadizadeh, Maliheh; Menon, Devidas","BACKGROUND: Personal safety is a widespread public health issue that affects people of all demographics. There is a growing interest in the use of mobile apps for enhancing personal safety, particularly for children and youth at risk, who are among the most vulnerable groups in society.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore what is known about the use of mobile apps for personal safety among children and youth identified to be ""at risk.""METHODS: A scoping review following published methodological guidelines was conducted. In total, 5 databases (Scopus, SocINDEX, PsycINFO, Compendex, and Inspec Archive) were searched for relevant scholarly articles published between January 2005 and October 2023. The gray literature was searched using Google and Google Scholar search engines. The results were reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. For summarizing the features and users' experiences of the apps, a published framework for evaluating the quality of mobile health apps for youth was used.RESULTS: A total of 1986 articles were identified, and 41 (2.1%) were included in the review. Nine personal safety apps were captured and categorized into 4 groups based on the goals of the apps, as follows: dating and sexual violence prevention (n=4, 44% of apps), bullying and school violence prevention (n=2, 22% of apps), self-harm and suicide prevention (n=2, 22% of apps), and homeless youth support (n=1, 11% of apps). Of the 41 articles, 25 (61%) provided data solely on app descriptions and features, while the remaining 16 (39%) articles provided data on app evaluations and descriptions. Outcomes focused on app engagement, users' experiences, and effectiveness. Four articles reported on app use, 3 (75%) of which reported relatively high app use. Data on users' experience were obtained from 13 studies. In general, participants found the app features to be easy to use and useful as educational resources and personal safety tools. Most of the views were positive. Negative perceptions included redundancy of app features and a lack of usefulness. Five apps were evaluated for effectiveness (n=2, 40% dating and sexual violence prevention; n=2, 40% self-harm and suicide prevention; and n=1, 20% bullying and school violence prevention) and were all associated with a statistically significant reduction (P=.001 to .048) in harm or risk to participants at the 95% CI.CONCLUSIONS: Although many personal safety apps are available, few studies have specifically evaluated those designed for youth. However, the evidence suggests that mobile safety apps generally appear to be beneficial for reducing harm to at-risk children and youth without any associated adverse events. Recommendations for future research have been made to strengthen the evidence and increase the availability of effective personal safety apps for children and youth.",2024,,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,12,,e58127,,10.2196/58127,,#3218,Bowen-Forbes 2024,,
Urbanicity and alcohol use epidemiology in the 21st century,"Castaldelli-Maia, João Mauricio","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aimed to gather recent studies that could identify the specificities in the relationship between urbanization and alcohol use epidemiology in the current century.RECENT FINDINGS: Although we find lower rates of alcohol use among adolescents in urban environments than in rural ones, this difference tends to diminish until it disappears by the time they reach adulthood. In addition to excessive marketing and increased accessibility, several urban environment characteristics have been related to alcohol use. First, problematic alcohol use is linked to stress and mental health problems like depression and anxiety, which are common in metropolitan areas. Second, alcohol use behaviors are influenced by homelessness, loneliness, and deprivation in megacities, where female and male individuals have presented more similar alcohol use behaviors (i.e. gender convergence). Third, treatment levels for alcohol use disorders are very low.SUMMARY: There is a new epidemiological wave of alcohol consumption in large urban centers, largely influenced by advertisement and marketing. Social and psychological risk factors and subpopulations of interest were identified for preventive interventions in large urban centers (i.e. advertisement regulation). In addition, increasing the availability of treatment, including specific medications for alcohol use disorder, should be strongly encouraged.",2023,,Curr Opin Psychiatry,36,3,243-248,,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000860,,#3219,Castaldelli-Maia 2023,,
Sleep deprivation in an American homeless population,"Gonzalez, Ariana; Tyminski, Quinn","BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently labeled sleep deprivation an epidemic in America with 35% of Americans reporting less than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep each night. A recent study in France found that people experiencing homelessness sleep less and experience increased daytime fatigue as compared with the general population. Sleep intervention and research are rarely the focus for this population resulting in insufficient literature and knowledge to date on sleep health in people experiencing homelessness.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine quality, quantity, supports, and barriers to sleep within a homeless population.DESIGN: A mixed-methods survey was conducted to obtain data on sleep in the homeless population.PARTICIPANTS: 32 English-speaking adults experiencing homelessness were recruited from a local homeless organization.MEASURES: A web-based survey and two self-report standardized assessments were administered. Standardized assessments included Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Form v1.0-Fatigue 13a and the PROMIS Short Form v1.0-Sleep Disturbance 8b.RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of participants report getting less than the 7-9 recommended hours of sleep per night. Participants scored almost one standard deviation above the mean on both PROMIS measures demonstrating greater fatigue and sleep disturbance as compared with the general population. Four themes were identified via qualitative analysis: lack of environmental control, emotion and thought, substance use as a sleep aid, and sleep is important for health and daily function.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a need for sleep hygiene intervention within the homeless population. Sleep deprivation is a barrier to the population's ability to obtaining housing.",2020,,Sleep Health,6,4,489-494,,10.1016/j.sleh.2020.01.002,,#3220,Gonzalez 2020,,
Young-Adult Social Outcomes of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Riglin, Lucy; Todd, Andrew; Blakey, Rachel; Shakeshaft, Amy; Stergiakouli, Evie; Davey Smith, George; Tilling, Kate; Thapar, Anita","Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adult life. However, it is unclear whether the risk pathways to adverse adult outcomes are established during childhood or whether associations are driven by concurrent ADHD symptoms that have persisted to adulthood. Methods: We examined associations between broadly defined child-limited (remitted) and persistent ADHD (assessed using the ADHD subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) with negative social outcomes (low emotional and instrumental support, antisocial behavior, employment, receipt of state benefits as an indicator of socio-economic disadvantage, homelessness) at age 25 years in a UK longitudinal population sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (age 25 data collected between years 2017 and 2018; total N = 6,439). Results: Up to 20% of young people with less favorable social outcomes at age 25 had persistent ADHD. Persistent ADHD was associated with an increased likelihood of being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 2.06 to 6.67, P = 1 × 10-05) and receiving state benefits (OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.62 to 4.57, P = 2 × 10-04) at age 25 years compared to those without ADHD. We did not find strong evidence of associations between child-limited ADHD and social outcomes (NEET OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.54 to 2.69, P = .65; state benefits OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.76 to 2.51, P = .29). Persistent ADHD associations with negative social outcomes were observed across family-of-origin income groups and sex and were not explained by comorbidity. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of continued monitoring and management of ADHD symptoms and related social as well as clinical outcomes across development into adulthood. Future research is needed to identify what factors promote positive social outcomes, including effective treatment of adult ADHD symptoms.",2023,,J Clin Psychiatry,84,2,22m14379,,10.4088/JCP.22m14379,,#3221,Riglin 2023,,
Cardiovascular disease in homeless versus housed individuals: a systematic review of observational and interventional studies,"Al-Shakarchi, Nader James; Evans, Hannah; Luchenski, Serena A.; Story, Alistair; Banerjee, Amitava","OBJECTIVES: To identify: (i) risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in homeless versus housed individuals and (ii) interventions for CVD in homeless populations.METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review in EMBASE until December 2018 using a search strategy for observational and interventional studies without restriction regarding languages or countries. Meta-analyses were conducted, where appropriate and possible. Outcome measures were all-cause and CVD mortality, and morbidity.RESULTS: Our search identified 17 articles (6 case-control, 11 cohort) concerning risk of CVD and none regarding specific interventions. Nine were included to perform a meta-analysis. The majority (13/17, 76.4%) were high quality and all were based in Europe or North America, including 765 459 individuals, of whom 32 721 were homeless. 12/17 studies were pre-2011. Homeless individuals were more likely to have CVD than non-homeless individuals (pooled OR 2.96; 95% CI 2.80 to 3.13; p<0.0001; heterogeneity p<0.0001; I2=99.1%) and had increased CVD mortality (age-standardised mortality ratio range: 2.6-6.4). Compared with non-homeless individuals, hypertension was more likely in homeless people (pooled OR 1.38-1.75, p=0.0070; heterogeneity p=0.935; I2=0.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people have an approximately three times greater risk of CVD and an increased CVD mortality. However, there are no studies of specific pathways/interventions for CVD in this population.

This scoping review identifies what is known about pregnancy prevention and contraception knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among US women experiencing homelessness. This review examined English articles that measured the context of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs related to contraceptive use for avoiding pregnancy among US women experiencing homelessness. Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, articles published before May 2022 were located via PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Embase. The initial search identified 1204 articles, and 10 met the inclusion criteria.

"Morbidity and housing status 10 years after shelter use-follow-up of homeless men in Helsinki, Finland","Stenius-Ayoade, Agnes; Haaramo, Peija; Kautiainen, Hannu; Sunikka, Sanna; Gissler, Mika; Wahlbeck, Kristian; Eriksson, Johan G.","BACKGROUND: Homelessness is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and social difficulties and periods of homelessness are sometimes prolonged or repeated. However, there are no long-term follow-up studies focusing upon housing status among homeless people. The aim of this study was to examine morbidity and housing outcomes and to identify factors predicting being independently housed 10 years after shelter use.METHODS: By combining data from several registers we followed all 552 homeless men who stayed in shelter in Helsinki during 2004 and determined their housing situation and morbidity 10 years later. Their situation was compared with an age-matched control group from the general population (N = 946). Using logistic regression analysis, we assessed the predictive effects of socioeconomic factors and health service use at baseline on becoming independently housed.RESULTS: By the end of the follow-up 52.0% of the formerly homeless study group had died, compared with 14.6% of the controls. At 10 years, 6.0% were independently housed, 37.5% lived in supported housing and 4.5% were still or again homeless. Psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorder, were present in 77.5% of the homeless, compared with 16.1% among the controls. Being married (OR 8.3, 95% CI 3.0 to 23.2) and having less than four shelter nights in year 2004 (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 30.8) strongly predicted being independently housed 10 years later.CONCLUSIONS: Homeless staying in shelters have high mortality and morbidity and most of those surviving, are in need of support in their everyday lives even years after the shelter period.",2018,,Eur J Public Health,28,6,1092-1097,,10.1093/eurpub/cky038,,#3224,Stenius-Ayoade 2018,,
[How to Help Young People with Early Psychosis avoid Homlessness?],"Deschênes, Julie Marguerite; Roy, Laurence; Girard, Nicolas; Abdel-Baki, Amal","Objectives Based on clinical experience and literature, this article aims to stimulate reflection among the actors involved concerning the organization of services and the interventions to be favored with young people living both a first episode of psychosis and a situation of residential instability or homelessness. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the literature on the situation of these young people and their needs, the challenges they face in their pathway within the healthcare system and the various interventions to consider with them both to prevent or exit homelessness. Method This literature review presents a narrative synthesis of articles from literature reviews or primary studies published in French or English between 1995 and March 2021, with a focus on the services and intervention practices implemented in Quebec in recent years. Certain interventions can be made at different periods of time in a young person's journey to change their trajectory and prevent homelessness or limit its duration and consequences. Throughout this article, a case study will illustrate these interventions occurring at different times in the life of a young person. Results The risk of residential instability and homelessness in young people living with emerging psychosis is higher than in the general population. This situation can contribute to the onset or worsening of psychosis due to the stress associated with difficult living conditions and the increased possibilities of victimization experiences. This great precariousness can also be the consequence of psychosis and its associated conditions. However, very few studies focus specifically on young people experiencing both a first episode of psychosis and a situation of homelessness or residential instability. The instability associated with homelessness complicates their pathway to mental health care, delays their access to the appropriate services and interferes with their engagement in follow-up. Interventions aimed at preventing homelessness include support in the transition to adulthood and identifying situations of residential instability. Regarding the organization of care, integrated mental health service centers for young people and the development of partnerships, networking and intersectorality make it possible to overcome certain challenges. Intensive outreach interventions models as well as interventions aiming residential stability are favorable to young people who are already experiencing homelessness. Conclusion Residential instability and homelessness imply several challenges faced by young people living with emerging psychosis concerning the access, the continuity and the quality of mental health services. Integrated interventions both to prevent or exit homelessness can be implemented to stem this problem.",2021,,Sante Ment Que,46,2,189-216,,,,#3225,Deschênes 2021,,

Factors associated with homelessness referrals for an acute young adult psychiatric unit,"Dymond, Alexander; Branjerdporn, Grace","BACKGROUND: Homelessness is correlated with significant mental illness. Homelessness is a key psychosocial issue leading to significant use of hospital resources outside medical intervention.AIM: This study examines the characteristics, post-discharge pathway and length of stay of individuals presenting with homelessness in an acute young adult psychiatric ward.METHOD: Prospective chart audit was conducted to assess the demographic information, acute presentation, clinical risk and length of stay for homelessness referrals to Social Work. Participants (N = 88) were aged 18 to 25 years old and admitted to a tertiary level psychiatric ward specifically for this age group. Acute risk presentations of all psychiatric conditions, such as Schizophrenia, Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Bipolar Affective Disorder, Drug Induced Psychosis and Anorexia Nervosa, may be admitted to the unit. Descriptive statistics, one sample t-tests and Pearson's correlations were completed.RESULTS: No homeless patient was accommodated by local area services due to lack of availability. Change in homelessness status tended to worsen during hospitalisation, with 24% having worse accommodation upon discharge compared to 13% who improved. Length of stay was significantly longer for homeless patients compared to non-homeless patients, but not when excluding the length of time spent attempting to address homeless risk. Homeless patients presenting with an eating disorder acute presentation spent longer time in hospital, and those with psychotic acute presentations had more dynamic risk factors. Length of stay and static risk factors were positively correlated with government mental health community follow-up.CONCLUSION: Hospitalisation is not an effective intervention for homelessness and the Gold Coast Mental Health units are not resourced or linked to provide accommodation outcomes in a positive or economic manner. Future consideration should be given to health and community resources around homelessness, including health-specific housing interventions and community mental health teams incorporating homelessness risk vulnerability into their ongoing clinical risk mitigation.",2021,,Int J Soc Psychiatry,67,6,713-719,,10.1177/0020764020970239,,#3228,Dymond 2021,,
Resilience factors in youth transitioning out of foster care: A systematic review,"Nuñez, Miguel; Beal, Sarah J.; Jacquez, Farrah","OBJECTIVE: Youth who emancipate from the foster care system often experience poor outcomes during their transition into independent living (e.g., criminal justice involvement and homelessness). Yet, some youth are resilient and achieve positive outcomes. The purpose of this study is to review the resilience factors identified in the literature for youth transitioning out of care.METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PsycINFO, PubMed, and EMBASE databases. A total of 12 studies met our inclusion criteria.RESULTS: A total of 38 different resilience factors were identified across the studies reviewed. From these resilience factors, 18 were statistically significant, including four assets and 14 resources.CONCLUSION: Understanding the assets and resources that promote resilience can aid clinicians in assessing and capitalizing on youths' strengths and can help researchers develop effective interventions and target gaps in the literature. Further, it can assist policymakers in generating legislation to improve outcomes for foster youth transitioning out of care. To assist in this process, we systematically reviewed studies to provide a summary of resilience factors currently identified in the literature.

Immigrants' outcome after a first-episode psychosis,"Abdel-Baki, Amal; Ouellet-Plamondon, Clairélaine; Medrano, Sofia; Nicole, Luc; Rousseau, Cécile","AIM: Immigration is a risk factor for psychosis emergence, and previous studies show that immigrants are less likely to engage in treatment for psychosis. However, the literature on outcome is scant and heterogeneous. This study was designed to compare first-generation (FGI) and second-generation immigrants (SGI) to non-immigrants' symptomatic and functional outcomes 2 years after a first-episode psychosis (FEP).METHODS: A 2-year prospective longitudinal study of 223 FEP patients between 18 and 30 years took place in two early intervention services (EIS) in Montreal, Canada.RESULTS: Forty-two per cent of the sample were immigrants (FGI (n = 56), SGI (n = 38)). Compared with non-immigrants, immigrants had similar symptomatic and functioning profiles at baseline, 1 and 2 years, except that fewer SGI had a history of homelessness and more were living with their families. FGI were less likely to have a substance use disorder but more likely to pursue their studies and to present depressive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Even if immigrants are known to be at greater risk of developing psychosis, probably secondary to stress related to immigration, their symptomatic and functional outcomes, once engaged in EIS treatment, are similar to or sometimes better than non-immigrants' outcomes. Because immigrants tend to be less engaged in their follow-up, understanding why they disengage from treatment is crucial to develop better therapeutic approaches to better engage them as EIS treatment can improve their outcomes effectively.",2018,,Early Interv Psychiatry,12,2,193-201,,10.1111/eip.12302,,#3234,Abdel-Baki 2018,,

The present analyses include those who identified as female, ever had sex with a man, and were at risk of HIV infection (did not report a previous positive HIV test result) (n = 2624). We conducted latent class analysis to identify sexual risk classes, and modeled associations with engagement in HIV prevention services and HIV test results.RESULTS: We identified 6 classes of sexual risk behavior: (1) low risk, (2) monogamous, (3) casual partner, (4) multiple partners, (5) exchange sex, and (6) exchange plus main partner. The class distribution was similar across the mainland regions. Bisexual orientation and homelessness were significant predictors of higher-risk class. HIV prevalence and participation in behavioral interventions did not vary significantly by risk class, while obtaining and using free condoms did. Independent of risk class, women in cities in the South were significantly less likely to use free condoms, and HIV prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black women and women aged 40-49 years.CONCLUSIONS: Bisexual orientation and homelessness were predictors of higher risk.

"Utilization of modern contraceptives and associated factors among women of homeless reproductive age in Adama town, Oromia, Ethiopia","Feyissa, Gemechu Dereje; Belihu, Seble; Endebu, Tamrat","BACKGROUND: Family planning refers to a conscious effort by a couple to limit or space the number of children they have through the use of contraceptive methods. Contraceptive utilization is a practice that helps individuals or couples avoid unwanted pregnancy. A lack of family planning puts homeless individuals at a higher risk of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. However, there is little data about modern contraceptive utilization among homeless women in the study area.OBJECTIVES: It has aimed to assess the utilization of modern contraceptives and associated factors among homeless reproductive-age women in Adama town, 2023.METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Adama town among 286 homeless women. A convenience sampling technique was used. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pretested structured questionnaire. The collected data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi Info, and the data were exported to the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. The associations between dependent and independent variables were modeled using binary logistic regression. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate associations, and a P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.RESULTS: Out of the planned 289 respondents, 286 (98.9%) were participated. The prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization was 56.6% [95% CI: (50.7, 62.2)]. Among the utilizers, implants (52.5%), injectables (42%), and pills (5.5%) were used. Homeless women aged 25-34 years [AOR = 4.22, 95% CI: (1.77, 10.05)], a formal education [AOR = 3.04, 95% CI: (1.21, 7.60)], a slept off-street [AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: (1.25, 6.34)], a monthly income greater than or equal to 2400 Ethiopian birr [AOR = 4.18, 95% CI: (2.11, 8.29)], a sexual intercourse AOR = 3.14, 95% CI: (1.17, 8.40)], and a history of pregnancy after joining the street life [AOR = 9.21, 95% CI: (3.67, 23.12)] were factors significantly associated with the utilization of modern contraceptives.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization among homeless women was relatively higher than in previous studies. The associated factors for contraceptive utilization included age, education, place for sleeping, income, sexual intercourse and history of pregnancy after joining the street life. The Regional and Adama town Health Bureau and facilities should develop targeted interventions (considering age, educational, and other disparities) to reduce the unmet need for modern contraception and halt unnecessary health outcomes among homeless women, their children, and families.",2024,,BMC Womens Health,24,1,579,,10.1186/s12905-024-03407-2,,#3243,Feyissa 2024,,
Scoping review: Scope of practice of nurse-led services and access to care for people experiencing homelessness,"McWilliams, Lucy; Paisi, Martha; Middleton, Sandy; Shawe, Jill; Thornton, Anna; Larkin, Matthew; Taylor, Joanne; Currie, Jane","AIMS: To investigate the scope of practice of nurse-led services for people experiencing homelessness, and the influence on access to healthcare.DESIGN: A scoping review.DATA SOURCES: On 20 November 2020, the following databases were searched: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Scopus.REVIEW METHODS: Included studies focused on people experiencing homelessness aged 18 years and over, nurse-led services in any setting and described the nursing scope of practice. Studies were peer-reviewed primary research, published in English from the year 2000. Three authors performed quality appraisals using the mixed methods assessment tool. Results were synthesized and discussed narratively and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR 2020 Statement.RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included from the United States (n = 9), Australia (n = 4), United Kingdom (n = 4) and Canada (n = 2). The total participant sample size was n = 6303. Studies focused on registered nurses (n = 10), nurse practitioners (n = 5) or both (n = 4), in outpatient or community settings. The nursing scope of practice was broad and covered a range of skills, knowledge and attributes. Key skills identified include assessment and procedural skills, client support and health education. Key attributes were a trauma-informed approach and building trust through communication. Important knowledge included understanding the impact of homelessness, knowledge of available services and the capacity to undertake holistic assessments. Findings suggest that nurse-led care facilitated access to healthcare through building trust and supporting clients to access services.CONCLUSION: Optimized nursing scope of practice can facilitate access to healthcare for people experiencing homelessness. Key factors in enabling this include autonomy in nursing practice, organizational support and education.IMPACT: The broad range of skills, knowledge and attributes reported provide a foundation from which to design an educational framework to optimize the nursing scope of practice, thereby increasing access to healthcare for people experiencing homelessness.",2022,,J Adv Nurs,78,11,3587-3606,,10.1111/jan.15387,,#3247,McWilliams 2022,,
Substance-related poisoning hospitalizations and homelessness in Canada: a descriptive study,"Plouffe, Rebecca; White, Rochelle; Orpana, Heather; Grywacheski, Vera","INTRODUCTION: The objective of this analysis is to describe patient demographics, the context, characteristics and outcomes of a substance-related poisoning, and the recorded mental disorder of people with housing and those experiencing homelessness.METHODS: Hospitalization data for Canada (except Quebec) from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 were retrieved from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database using ICD-10-CA codes for up to 25 diagnoses for substance-related poisonings, homelessness status and other characteristics relevant to the patient's hospitalization. We compared the characteristics of people experiencing homelessness with those of people who were housed, and their substance-related poisoning hospitalizations, using chi-square, t tests and Fisher exact test.RESULTS: There was a higher proportion of males, younger individuals and people with recorded mental disorders among people experiencing homelessness hospitalized for a substance-related poisoning than among their housed counterparts. Substance-related poisonings among people experiencing homelessness were more likely to be accidental, involve opioids and stimulants (most frequently fentanyl and its analogues and heroin), result in lengthier hospitalizations and end with leaving the hospital against medical advice.CONCLUSION: These findings can be used to strengthen strategies and interventions to reduce substance-related harms in priority populations, particularly those experiencing homelessness.",2024,,Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can,44,5,208-217,,10.24095/hpcdp.44.5.02,,#3250,Plouffe 2024,,
The elusiveness of representativeness in general population surveys for alcohol,"Rehm, Jürgen; Kilian, Carolin; Rovira, Pol; Shield, Kevin D.; Manthey, Jakob","Population survey research is limited by biases introduced through the exclusion of sub-populations from the sampling frame and by non-response bias. This is a particular problem for alcohol surveys, where populations such as the homeless and the institutionalised-who consume on average more alcohol than the general population-are usually excluded, and where people who respond to alcohol surveys tend to consume less alcohol than those who do not. These biases lead to the underestimation of alcohol consumption at the population level, which can be corrected for by triangulating alcohol consumption data with population data sources (i.e. taxation and production). Other methods which account for the biases inherent in surveys include triangulation with outcomes (e.g. traffic injuries), calculation of estimates for groups which are outside common sampling frames, and combining probabilistic sampling with new methodologies, such as computer-assisted web interviews. In particular, population surveys do not attract sufficient participation numbers for certain groups, such as the marginalised urban male youths. In this situation, it may be helpful to add estimates generated via respondent-driven sampling or non-probabilistic web panels restricted to a specific group to such population surveys. Additionally, computer-assisted web interviews perform better for sensitive questions, such as those about personal alcohol use. In sum, based on the objectives, the future of survey will need to include statistical modelling, adding data from external sources for validation and combining data from various types of surveys.",2021,,Drug Alcohol Rev,40,2,161-165,,10.1111/dar.13148,,#3253,Rehm 2021,,
"Homelessness and police-recorded crime victimisation: a nationwide, register-based cohort study","Nilsson, Sandra Feodor; Nordentoft, Merete; Fazel, Seena; Laursen, Thomas Munk","BACKGROUND: Homelessness is associated with crime victimisation, which is a leading cause of death, exacerbates health problems, and increases the risk of violence. We aimed to study the risk of police-recorded crime victimisation in individuals with experiences of homelessness compared with the general population.METHODS: We did a nationwide, register-based cohort study of people aged 15 years or older, who were alive in 2001 and born in Denmark between 1980 and 2001. The cohort was constructed using the Danish Civil Registration System, with data linked across other registries (including the Danish Homeless Register, Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the Danish Central Crime Register) by use of personal identification numbers. The exposure, experience of homelessness, was defined as at least one contact with a homeless shelter. The outcome was the date of first police-recorded crime victimisation. We calculated incidence rates per 1000 person-years, incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and cumulative probability of any crime victimisation and of violent crime victimisation. Psychiatric disorders, socioeconomic markers, and history of criminal offences were included as confounders.FINDINGS: Within the study period (Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2015), 1 182 749 individuals (9 831 776 person-years) aged 15-35 years were included, of which 184 813 (15·6%) had at least one crime victimisation incident (73 999 [40%] of which were violent victimisations). 4286 individuals (22 240 person-years) had at least one homeless shelter contact. Relative to the general population, and adjusting for age and calendar year, individuals with experience of homelessness had an increased risk of any crime victimisation (IRR 2·7 [95% CI 2·4-3·0]) in females and 2·3 [2·1-2·5] in males), and especially of violent crime victimisation (7·2 [6·3-8·2] in females and 3·6 [3·2-4·0] in males). This increased risk remained significant after further adjustments for potential confounders. People with both a psychiatric diagnosis and experience of homelessness had the highest risk of violent victimisation (IRR 10·1 [95% CI 8·6-11·9] in females and 4·3 [3·8-4·9] in males), while people with no psychiatric diagnosis or experience of homelessness (the reference group) had the lowest risk. In the 5 years after an individual's first homeless shelter contact, the cumulative probabilities of any crime victimisation were 23% (95% CI 21-26) in females and 16% (15-18) in males, which were substantially higher than those of the general population.INTERPRETATION: Homeless populations are at substantially increased risk of crime victimisation, highlighting the need for strategic and targeted approaches to prevent homelessness and to help people out of homelessness. Improvements in multiagency working (such as between homeless shelters, health-care services, substance misuse services, and police forces) might be important to reduce the risk of victimisation in marginalised populations, such as those with complex psychiatric or social problems, with experience of homelessness.FUNDING: Lundbeck Foundation.",2020,,Lancet Public Health,5,6,e333-e341,,10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30075-X,,#3256,Nilsson 2020,,

They are influenced by numerous dimensions of health, including physical health, mental health, and social isolation. At all stages of homelessness, the stakeholders and homeless people must work together to address the issue. As a result, this study will be helpful to generate relevant data that may guide policymakers in designing solutions for this underserved group of people.OBJECTIVES: To explore coping mechanisms and suggestions to stakeholders among women experiencing homelessness in Dire Dawa city, eastern Ethiopia, 2021.DESIGN: A community-based phenomenological qualitative study was conducted at Dire Dawa city.METHODS: Data were collected from women experiencing homelessness and key informants through focus group discussion and in-depth interviews using a semi-structured tool. A total of 31 women experiencing homelessness (13 in-depth interviews and 3 focus group discussion with 6 participants in each) and 2 key informants participated in this study. Data were analyzed thematically using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti 7. The thematic analysis follows six steps: familiarization, coding, generating themes, reviewing themes, naming themes, and writing up.RESULTS: Two major themes were driven: coping mechanisms and suggestions to stakeholders. There are three subthemes under the coping mechanism (begging, survival sex, and child prostitution) while there are a total of seven subthemes under suggestions to stakeholders (integration and collaboration, special attention to children, family education, shelter and job, schooling, sexual education, and addiction rehabilitation).CONCLUSION: Child prostitution and survival sex are a very common coping mechanism which is practiced by women experiencing homelessness. Changing society's mindset and paying special attention to children is critical.

Late Adolescent Predictors of Homelessness and Food Insecurity During Emerging Adulthood,"Tucker, Joan S.; Davis, Jordan P.; Perez, Lilian G.; Klein, David J.; D'Amico, Elizabeth J.","PURPOSE: Economic instability is a significant and growing problem among emerging adults in the U.S. This study identifies adolescent factors across multiple levels of influence that predict homelessness and food insecurity 5 years later.METHODS: The analytic sample (n = 2,110) completed a survey in 2015-2016 (mean age 17) that assessed a range of demographic, behavioral health, family, peer, academic, and neighborhood factors, and a follow-up survey in 2019-2020 (mean age 23) that assessed past-year homelessness and food insecurity. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for the full sample, and by race/ethnicity.RESULTS: At follow-up, 7.5% of participants reported homelessness, and 29.3% reported food insecurity. Multivariate analyses indicated that only adverse childhood experiences and weaker academic orientation predicted both outcomes. Future homelessness was additionally predicted by greater exposure to substance using peers during adolescence. Identifying as Hispanic, lower maternal education, and greater neighborhood disorganization were risk factors for future food insecurity, and living with both biological parents and better mental health were protective factors. Race/ethnicity stratified models showed variations in multilevel predictors of both outcomes, except for adverse childhood experiences, which were significant across all subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences and weaker academic orientation emerged as the most robust predictors of economic instability in emerging adulthood. However, a range of other modifiable multilevel predictors in adolescence were identified that were unique to homelessness or food insecurity and that varied by race/ethnicity. Results suggest the need for multilevel approaches early in life to reduce risk of economic instability during emerging adulthood.",2022,,J Adolesc Health,70,5,736-742,,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.10.035,,#3262,Tucker 2022,,

They are also more likely to have less access to healthcare. These processes of access can be better understood using Levesque's access framework which addresses both supply (service provision) and demand (user abilities).METHODS: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, electronic peer-reviewed databases were searched in February 2022 for studies published since 2000 related to access to healthcare for PEH ages 16 and older in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland. Retrieved articles were screened and those eligible were selected for data extraction. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included.RESULTS: Fifty-six papers out of 538 identified were selected and aliased. Six main themes were identified: staff education, flexibility of systems, service coordination, patient preparedness, complex health needs and holistic care. These relate to the Levesque access framework.CONCLUSIONS: Improving access to healthcare for PEH requires changes to how services are provided and how service-user abilities are supported.",2022,,BMC Health Serv Res,22,1,910,,10.1186/s12913-022-08265-y,,#3265,McNeill 2022,,
Identifying Predictors of Homelessness Among Adults in a Large Integrated Health System in Northern California,"Rodriguez, Luis A.; Thomas, Tainayah W.; Finertie, Holly; Wiley, Deanne; Dyer, Wendy T.; Sanchez, Perla E.; Yassin, Maher; Banerjee, Somalee; Adams, Alyce; Schmittdiel, Julie A.","Introduction Homelessness contributes to worsening health and increased health care costs. There is little published research that leverages rich electronic health record (EHR) data to predict future homelessness risk and inform interventions to address it. The authors' objective was to develop a model for predicting future homelessness using individual EHR and geographic data covariates. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 2,543,504 adult members (≥ 18 years old) from Kaiser Permanente Northern California and evaluated which covariates predicted a composite outcome of homelessness status (hospital discharge documentation of a homeless patient, medical diagnosis of homelessness, approved medical financial assistance application for homelessness, and/or ""homeless/shelter"" in address name). The predictors were measured in 2018-2019 and included prior diagnoses and demographic and geographic data. The outcome was measured in 2020. The cohort was split (70:30) into a derivation and validation set, and logistic regression was used to model the outcome. Results Homelessness prevalence was 0.35% in the overall sample. The final logistic regression model included 26 prior diagnoses, demographic, and geographic-level predictors. The regression model using the validation set had moderate sensitivity (80.4%) and specificity (83.2%) for predicting future cases of homelessness and achieved excellent classification properties (area under the curve of 0.891 [95% confidence interval = 0.884-0.897]). Discussion This prediction model can be used as an initial triage step to enhance screening and referral tools for identifying and addressing homelessness, which can improve health and reduce health care costs. Conclusions EHR data can be used to predict chance of homelessness at a population health level.",2023,,Perm J,27,1,56-71,,10.7812/TPP/22.096,,#3268,Rodriguez 2023,,

Demographic characteristics, primary diagnosis and comorbid conditions, and hospital course of treatment were described. Predictors of discharge to a health care facility versus routine discharge to home or self-care were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: There were 154,173 patient visits predominantly involving males, those aged 25-64 years, and non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans. The majority had comorbidities of depression, psychosis, and/or substance abuse (70.2%) and a routine discharge to home or self-care (81.9%). Discharge to home or self-care relative to another health care institution was associated with having charity coverage and being Black/African American.CONCLUSIONS: Those experiencing homelessness experience a high burden of health concerns.

While WaSH insecurity is prevalent in many low and middle-income countries, it is also a problem in high-income countries, like the United States, as is evident in vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness. Limited knowledge exists about the coping strategies unhoused people use to access WaSH services. This study, therefore, examines WaSH access among unhoused communities in Los Angeles, California, a city with the second-highest count of unhoused people across the nation.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a snowball sampling technique with 263 unhoused people living in Skid Row, Los Angeles. We calculated frequencies and used multivariable models to describe (1) how unhoused communities cope and gain access to WaSH services in different places, and (2) what individual-level factors contribute to unhoused people's ability to access WaSH services.RESULTS: Our findings reveal that access to WaSH services for unhoused communities in Los Angeles is most difficult at night. Reduced access to overnight sanitation resulted in 19% of the sample population using buckets inside their tents and 28% openly defecating in public spaces. Bottled water and public taps are the primary drinking water source, but 6% of the sample reported obtaining water from fire hydrants, and 50% of the population stores water for night use. Unhoused people also had limited access to water and soap for hand hygiene throughout the day, with 17% of the sample relying on hand sanitizer to clean their hands. Shower and laundry access were among the most limited services available, and reduced people's ability to maintain body hygiene practices and limited employment opportunities. Our regression models suggest that WaSH access is not homogenous among the unhoused. Community differences exist; the odds of having difficulty accessing sanitation services is two times greater for those living outside of Skid Row (Adj OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.08-6.37) and three times greater for people who have been unhoused for more than six years compared to people who have been unhoused for less than a year (Adj OR: 3.26; 95% CI: 1.36-8.07).CONCLUSION: Overall, this study suggests a need for more permanent, 24-h access to WaSH services for unhoused communities living in Skid Row, including toilets, drinking water, water and soap for hand hygiene, showers, and laundry services.",2023,,Int J Equity Health,22,1,108,,10.1186/s12939-023-01920-8,,#3274,AvelarPortillo 2023,,
Investigating young-adult social outcomes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Riglin, Lucy; Todd, Andrew; Blakey, Rachel; Shakeshaft, Amy; Stergiakouli, Evie; Smith, George Davey; Tilling, Kate; Thapar, Anita","OBJECTIVE: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adult life. However it is unclear whether the risk pathways to adverse adult outcomes are established during childhood or whether associations are driven by concurrent ADHD symptoms that have persisted to adulthood.METHODS: We examined associations between broadly defined child-limited (remitted) and persistent ADHD (assessed using the ADHD subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) with social outcomes (low emotional and instrumental support, antisocial behaviour, employment, receipt of state benefits as an indicator of socio-economic disadvantage, homelessness) at age 25 years in a UK longitudinal population sample ALPSAC (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, age 25 data collected between years 2017 and 2018): total N=6439.RESULTS: Up to 20% of young-people with less favourable social outcomes at age 25 had persistent ADHD. Persistent ADHD was associated with an increased likelihood of being not in education, employment or training (NEET: OR=3.71, 95% CI=2.06 to 6.67, p=1x10-05) and receiving state benefits (OR=2.72, 95% CI=1.62 to 4.57, p=2x10-04) at age 25 years compared to those without ADHD. We did not find strong evidence of associations between child-limited ADHD and social outcomes (NEET OR=1.20, 95% CI=0.54 to 2.69, p=0.65; state benefits OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.76 to 2.51, p=0.29). Persistent ADHD associations with negative social outcomes were observed across family-of-origin income groups, sex and were not explained by comorbidity.CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of continued monitoring and management of ADHD symptoms and related social as well as clinical outcomes across development into adulthood.

Hepatitis C virus risk among young people who inject drugs,"Mateu-Gelabert, Pedro; Sabounchi, Nasim S.; Guarino, Honoria; Ciervo, Courtney; Joseph, Kellie; Eckhardt, Benjamin J.; Fong, Chunki; Kapadia, Shashi N.; Huang, Terry T. K.","BACKGROUND: Injection drug use (IDU) is the leading risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in the U.S. While the general risk factors for HCV transmission are known, there is limited work on how these factors interact and impact young people who inject drugs (YPWID).METHODS: Project data were drawn from a study of 539 New York City (NYC) residents ages 18-29 who were recruited via Respondent-Driven Sampling and, reported past-month non-medical use of prescription opioids and/or heroin. Analyses are based on a subsample of 337 (62%) who reported injecting any drug in the past 12 months. All variables were assessed via self-report, except HCV status, which was established via rapid antibody testing. Integrating the observed statistical associations with extant literature on HCV risk, we also developed a qualitative system dynamics (SD) model to use as a supplemental data visualization tool to explore plausible pathways and interactions among key risk and protective factors for HCV.RESULTS: Results showed a 31% HCV antibody prevalence with an overall incidence of 10 per 100 person-years. HCV status was independently correlated with having shared cookers with two or more people (AOR = 2.17); injected drugs 4-6 years (AOR = 2.49) and 7 or more years (AOR = 4.95); lifetime homelessness (AOR = 2.52); and having been incarcerated two or more times (AOR = 1.99). These outcomes along with the extant literature on HCV risk were used to develop the qualitative SD model, which describes a causal hypothesis around non-linearities and feedback loop structures underlying the spread of HCV among YPWID.CONCLUSIONS: Despite ongoing harm reduction efforts, close to a third of YPWID in the community sample have been exposed to HCV, have risks for injection drug use, and face challenges with structural factors that may be preventing adequate intervention. The qualitative SD model explores these issues and contributes to a better understanding of how these various risk factors interact and what policies could potentially be effective in reducing HCV infections.",2022,,Front Public Health,10,,835836,,10.3389/fpubh.2022.835836,,#3283,Mateu-Gelabert 2022,,
The Joint Effect of Childhood Abuse and Homelessness on Substance Use in Adulthood,"Ararso, Yonathan; Beharie, Nisha Nicole; Scheidell, Joy D.; Schatz, Daniel; Quinn, Kelly; Doran, Kelly M.; Khan, Maria R.","Childhood abuse and homelessness are independently associated with substance use. Though childhood abuse and homelessness are strongly correlated, research on the joint effect of exposure to both traumatic life events on substance use is limited. Objective: To estimate independent and joint effects of childhood abuse and homelessness on substance use risk during emerging adulthood and adulthood. Methods: Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 12,288), we measured associations between exposure to physical or sexual abuse in childhood, homelessness in childhood or emerging adulthood, or exposure to both traumas and outcomes of binge drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use, methamphetamine use, and prescription opioid misuse during emerging adulthood (Wave III, ages 18-26 years) and adulthood (Wave IV, ages 24-32 years). Results: In adjusted analyses, exposure to childhood abuse alone, homelessness alone, and both childhood abuse and homelessness were significant correlates of most substance use indicators in emerging adulthood. Those jointly exposed to childhood abuse and homelessness had disproportionate risk of substance use, particularly use of cocaine (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=4.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.70, 6.71) and methamphetamine (AOR = 6.59, 95% CI: 3.87, 11.21). The independent and combined effects of abuse and homelessness generally persisted into adulthood though associations tended to weaken.

Understanding the life experiences of people with multiple complex needs: peer research in a health needs assessment,"Harland, Jill M.; Adams, Emma A.; Boobis, Sophie; Cheetham, Mandy; Wiseman, Alice; Ramsay, Sheena E.","BACKGROUND: Multiple complex needs (MCN) describe a population experiencing a combination of homelessness, substance use, offending and/or mental ill-health. Using peer researchers, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of individuals with lived experience of MCN with regards to (i) issues leading to MCN and (ii) key intervention opportunities.METHODS: As part of a health needs assessment in Gateshead (North East England), trained peer researchers interviewed 27 adults (aged ≥18 years) with experience of MCN, identified using purposive sampling methods. Peer researchers designed a topic guide for interviews which were audio recorded and thematically analyzed.RESULTS: Interviewees reported adverse childhood experiences leading to MCN including abuse, bereavement, parental imprisonment, family break-up and inadequate support. Mental ill-health, substance use, poverty, early experiences of unstable housing and acute homelessness were identified as major precedents for adulthood experiences of MCN. Between 16 and 20 years, access to housing, social and mental health support was perceived as having the potential to prevent circumstances worsening. Individuals perceived removing barriers to mental health, housing and welfare and financial supports could help.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the perceived role austerity, adverse childhood events and current service provision have in current and future experiences of MCN. Individuals expressed a need for future interventions and support to be judgement free and provided by workers who are educated about MCN and related adversity. Involving peer researchers and individuals with experience of MCN in future research and service provision could ensure appropriate measures and supports are put in place.",2022,,Eur J Public Health,32,2,176-190,,10.1093/eurpub/ckab142,,#3292,Harland 2022,,
Differences in stressful life events between men and women experiencing homelessness,"Rodriguez-Moreno, Sara; Vázquez, José J.; Roca, Pablo; Panadero, Sonia","People experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to experiencing stressful life events (SLEs) at some point in their lives; these SLEs are crucial for understanding the etiology and maintenance of homelessness. This study analyses the differences between men and women experiencing homelessness in the suffering of SLEs throughout their lives (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood). The sample consisted of a group of 293 people experiencing homelessness in Madrid (Spain): 156 men and 137 women. The results suggest that the number and type of SLEs experienced by men and women are different. In general, women experiencing homelessness suffer more SLEs than men in all periods of their lives. The differences in the level of sexual violence in childhood, sexual abuse in adulthood, and abuse by a spouse or partner are particularly striking. However, men experiencing homelessness score significantly higher than women for alcohol abuse, police complaints, arrest, and imprisonment throughout their lives. These findings have significant implications for the design of interventions and social policies that should be tailored to the specific needs of men and women who are homeless.",2021,,J Community Psychol,49,2,375-389,,10.1002/jcop.22465,,#3295,Rodriguez-Moreno 2021,,
Research on women with substance use disorders: Reviewing progress and developing a research and implementation roadmap,"Meyer, Jaimie P.; Isaacs, Krystyna; El-Shahawy, Omar; Burlew, A. Kathleen; Wechsberg, Wendee","BACKGROUND: Research on women with substance use disorders has expanded, yet knowledge and implementation gaps remain.METHODS: Drawing from topics discussed at the 2017 meeting of InWomen's in Montreal, Canada, this article reviews key progress in research on substance use among women, adolescents, and families to delineate priorities for the next generation of research.RESULTS: The field has seen significant accomplishments in multiple domains, including the management of pregnant women with substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders, caring for neonates in opioid withdrawal, greater inclusion of and treatment options for LGBTQ + communities, gendered instrumentation, and gender-focused HIV interventions for adolescent girls and women. Women who use alcohol and other drugs often experience other comorbid medical conditions (chronic Hepatitis C and HIV), contextual confounders (intimate partner violence exposure, homelessness, trauma), and social expectations (e.g., as caretakers) that must be addressed as part of integrated care to effectively treat women's substance use issues. Although significant advances have been made in the field to date, gender-based issues for women remain a neglected area in much of substance abuse research. Few dedicated and gender-focused funding opportunities exist and research has been siloed, limiting the potential for collaborations or interdisciplinary cross-talk.CONCLUSION: Given renewed attention to substance use in the context of the burgeoning opioid epidemic and shifts in global politics that affect women's substance use, the field requires a strategic rethink to invigorate a pipeline of future research and researchers.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend,197,,158-163,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.01.017,,#3298,Meyer 2019,,
Preliminary Efficacy of a Theory-Informed Intervention to Increase COVID-19 Testing Uptake Among People Who Inject Drugs in San Diego County: Findings From a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Bazzi, Angela R.; Abramovitz, Daniela; Harvey-Vera, Alicia; Stamos-Buesig, Tara; Vera, Carlos F.; Artamonova, Irina; Logan, Jenna; Patterson, Thomas L.; Strathdee, Steffanie A.","BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) have low rates of COVID-19 testing yet are vulnerable to severe disease. In partnership with a mobile syringe service program (SSP) in San Diego County, CA, we developed the evidence-, community-, and Social Cognitive Theory-informed ""LinkUP"" intervention (tailored education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving, and planning) to increase COVID-19 testing uptake among PWID.PURPOSE: To assess preliminary efficacy of LinkUP in increasing PWID COVID-19 testing in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).METHODS: We referred participants (PWID, ≥18 years old, San Diego County residents who had not recently undergone voluntary COVID-19 testing) to mobile SSP sites that had been randomized (by week) to offer the active LinkUP intervention or didactic attention-control conditions delivered by trained peer counselors. Following either condition, counselors offered on-site rapid COVID-19 antigen testing. Analyses estimated preliminary intervention efficacy and explored potential moderation.RESULTS: Among 150 participants, median age was 40.5 years, 33.3% identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 64.7% were male, 73.3% were experiencing homelessness, and 44.7% had prior mandatory COVID-19 testing. The LinkUP intervention was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 testing uptake (p < .0001). Homelessness moderated intervention effects; LinkUP increased COVID-19 testing uptake more among participants experiencing homelessness (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.56-2.09; p < .0001) than those not experiencing homelessness (aRR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.43; p = .04).CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this pilot RCT support the preliminary efficacy of the ""LinkUP"" intervention to increase COVID-19 testing among PWID and underscore the importance of academic-community partnerships and prevention service delivery through SSPs and other community-based organizations serving vulnerable populations.",2023,,Ann Behav Med,57,6,472-482,,10.1093/abm/kaad012,,#3301,Bazzi 2023,,
Student-Led Mobile Health Clinic: Patients Served and Learning Experience,"Duford, Amie; Matvienko, Oksana","PURPOSE: Community medicine curriculum prepares physician assistant (PA) students to provide services to vulnerable and underserved populations. This article describes a service-learning model that uses a mobile health clinic (MHC) experience as part of the community medicine rotation. It provides an overview of the clinic's operation, patient documentation and characteristics, and student learning experiences.METHODS: Students collected demographic information on patients who visited the MHC during January through December 2017. The students summarized patient demographics and reflected on their experiences in a report.RESULTS: Two main outcomes are discussed: characteristics of the MHC patients and student observations about their experiences. In 2017, 113 students rotated through the MHC and recorded 813 patient encounters. The largest proportions of patients reported living on the street or in a shelter (71%) and were older than 56 years (40%), males (74%), Caucasian (43%), single (65%), nonveterans (77%), and high school graduates (41%). The top 5 reasons for visits were preventive care, cognitive/functional impairment, cardiometabolic disorders, skin issues, and respiratory illness. The MHC experience and process of recording and analyzing demographic data contributed to students' data management and analytical skills. The students identified problems of recordkeeping and their implications for patient care, gained a greater understanding of medical needs and complexities of treating the homeless, and provided suggestions for improving quality and efficiency of care.CONCLUSIONS: The MHC service-learning model provides diverse, meaningful experiences for students.

These children's physical and mental health status is essential as they are highly prone to malnourishment and psychosocial distress. We aim to evaluate the orphan children's physical and psychosocial status living in orphanages.METHODS: This study adopted a cross-sectional research design conducted with the children living in the orphanages using a pretested, predesigned schedule. A total of 83 children (aged 5 to 19 years) living in three different orphanages in the Sonitpur District of Assam were randomly selected for the study. Body Mass Index (BMI) for age and height were then determined using WHO standards. Thinness was defined as BMI for age below -2 SD (Standard Deviation) and thinness as height for age below -2 SD. The behavioural and mental status of children aged 10-19 years were evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-21) with a cut-off value of SDQ score > 15 as the presence of emotional and behavioural distress.RESULTS: Almost 50% of orphans were in the age group of 10-14 years, 62.7% were females, and 42.2% had a primary level of education. 52.5% of orphans exhibited severe thinness for < -3 SD. Observed severe thinness more among the 5-9 years and 10-14 years (p-value < 0.05) group and among the male orphans (p-value < 0.05). Of 65 children aged 10-19, 18.5% had behavioural and mental distress. Emotional (32.3%) and poor conduct problems (23%) were observed significantly among male adolescents.CONCLUSIONS: Orphaned children, particularly those living in orphanages, are at risk of malnutrition and experience behavioural and psychosocial problems.

Prevalence and Correlates of Unstable Housing Among US Children,"Lebrun-Harris, Lydie A.; Sandel, Megan; Sheward, Richard; Poblacion, Ana; Ettinger de Cuba, Stephanie","IMPORTANCE: Housing instability is an important public health issue, particularly for children. This study provides nationally representative estimates of unstable housing among US children.OBJECTIVE: To examine unstable housing prevalence; differences by sociodemographic characteristics, health, and state of residence; and associations with other hardships.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study examined data from the 2022 National Survey of Children's Health, a population-based, nationally representative survey of randomly selected children whose parent or caregiver responded to an address-based mail or web-based survey. Participants were children aged 0 to 17 years living in households in the 50 US states and District of Columbia (N = 54 103). Bivariate analyses tested for observed differences in unstable housing between groups; logistic regression models tested for significant disparities. Associations between unstable housing and health care and food-related hardships, neighborhood conditions, and adverse childhood experiences were examined.EXPOSURE: Unstable housing experiences.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Unstable housing, comprising 3 indicators: inability to pay mortgage or rent on time in the past 12 months, 2 or more moves in the past 12 months, and homelessness in the child's lifetime. Analyses were adjusted for child age and family poverty ratio. Secondary analyses examine caregiver-reported stress or worry about eviction, foreclosure, or condemned housing in the past 12 months. Weighted prevalence estimates accounted for probability of selection and nonresponse.RESULTS: In 2022, 17.1% (95% CI, 16.4%-17.8%) of children living in US households, representing more than 12.1 million children, experienced 1 or more forms of unstable housing: 14.1% (95% CI, 13.4%-14.7%) lived in households that were unable to pay mortgage/rent, 2.9% (95% CI, 2.6%-3.3%) moved frequently, and 2.5% (95% CI, 2.2%-2.8%) experienced lifetime homelessness. Additionally, 9.0% (95% CI, 8.5%-9.5%) of children had caregivers who reported stress/worry over housing. Prevalence of unstable housing varied across states (range, 12.0%-26.6%). Unstable housing was highest among American Indian or Alaska Native children (27.9%; 95% CI, 21.3%-35.6%), Black or African American children (30.4%; 95% CI, 27.8%-33.1%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander children (27.6%; 95% CI, 16.6%-42.1%) and also differed by special health care needs, family poverty ratio, caregiver education and unemployment status, and whether the family rented or owned their home. Unstable housing was associated with all other types of hardships examined.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that 1 in 6 US children experienced unstable housing, varying by state and sociodemographic factors. The prevalence is likely underestimated because the sample excluded children who are currently institutionalized or experiencing homelessness. Results may help move the field toward a unified national definition of unstable housing for families with children and lead to clinically appropriate and evidence-based screening and interventions to support housing stability and improve children's health.",2024,,JAMA Pediatr,178,7,707-717,,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.1159,,#3310,Lebrun-Harris 2024,,
Seizures and emergency department: characteristics and factors of repeat adult attendees,"Lennard, Sarah; Henley, William; McLean, Brendan; Allard, Jon; Parrett, Mary; Jadav, Mark; Laugharne, Richard; Shankar, Rohit","BACKGROUND: To identify risk factors and characteristics for the repeated attendance at an emergency department (ED) following a seizure.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using non-identifiable data of individuals attending ED at least twice between 2015 and 2018, following a seizure. Data were drawn from the patient administration system of an English rural medium-sized teaching district general hospital emergency department (ED), serving a population of 566,000 people. It was analysed for bio-psycho-social features associated with repeat attendances.RESULTS: Of 3522 seizure-related attendances in the four years, 450 people were identified to be repeaters attending on two or more occasions (range 2-12). Just over a quarter (27%) were 18-29 years old. Higher likelihood of re-attendance was associated with social deprivation and no fixed abode. Mental illness was a significant co-morbidity influencing repeat attendances. Nearly half (47%) had no recorded anti-seizure medication (ASM). Three fifth (60%) were on general medication and a quarter (25%) on psychotropics. Nearly a quarter (22%) had alcohol and recreational drug concerns. Just over a quarter (28%) had no previous epilepsy diagnosis. Nearly a fifth (n = 85, 19%) died during the study period.CONCLUSION: People who present repeatedly with seizures at ED are at significant risk of death over a four-year period and require pro-active clinical follow-up. People who are homeless or from socially deprived areas are over-represented in this group, as are those with alcohol problems, co-morbid mental health conditions and compliance issues.

Predictors of clozapine discontinuation at 2 years in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,"Iruretagoyena, Barbara; Castañeda, Carmen Paz; Mena, Cristian; Diaz, Camila; Nachar, Ruben; Ramirez-Mahaluf, Juan Pablo; González-Valderrama, Alfonso; Undurraga, Juan; Maccabe, James H.; Crossley, Nicolas A.","INTRODUCTION: Little is known about predictors of clinical response to clozapine treatment in treatment-resistant psychosis. Most published cohorts are small, providing inconsistent results. We aimed to identify baseline clinical predictors of future clinical response in patients who initiate clozapine treatment, mainly focusing on the effect of age, duration of illness, baseline clinical symptoms and homelessness.METHODOLOGY: Retrospective cohort of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, aged between 15 and 60 years, that initiated clozapine between 2014 and 2017. Sociodemographic characteristics, years from illness diagnosis, and clinical presentation before the initiation of clozapine were collected and analyzed. All-cause discontinuation at two years follow-up was used as the primary measure of clozapine response.RESULTS: 261 patients were included with a median age at illness diagnosis of 23 years old (IQR 19-29) and a median age at clozapine initiation of 25 (IQR: 21-33). 72.33% (183/253) continued clozapine after two years follow-up.

Older age at clozapine initiation and longer delay from first schizophrenia diagnosis to clozapine initiation were also associated with higher clozapine non-adherence, with each year increasing the odds of discontinuation by 1.043 (95%CI 1.02-1.07; p = 0.001) and OR 1.092 (95%CI 1.01-1.18;p = 0.032) respectively.CONCLUSION: Starting clozapine in younger patients or shortly after schizophrenia diagnosis were associated with better adherence.",2021,,Schizophr Res,235,,102-108,,10.1016/j.schres.2021.07.024,,#3316,Iruretagoyena 2021,,
Substance Use Relapse Among Veterans at Termination of Treatment for Substance Use Disorders,"Betancourt, Christian A.; Kitsantas, Panagiota; Goldberg, Deborah G.; Hawks, Beth A.","INTRODUCTION: Military veterans continue to struggle with addiction even after receiving treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). Identifying factors that may influence SUD relapse upon receiving treatment in veteran populations is crucial for intervention and prevention efforts. The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors that contribute to SUD relapse upon treatment completion in a sample of U.S. veterans using logistic regression and classification tree analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the 2017 Treatment Episode Data Set-Discharge (TEDS-D) included 40,909 veteran episode observations. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine factors associated with SUD relapse after treatment discharge. Classification trees were constructed to identify high-risk subgroups for substance use after discharge from treatment for SUDs.RESULTS: Approximately 94% of the veterans relapsed upon discharge from outpatient or residential SUD treatment. Veterans aged 18-34 years old were significantly less likely to relapse than the 35-64 age group (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.82), while males were more likely than females to relapse (OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.79). Unemployed veterans (OR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.67, 2.22) or veterans not in the labor force (OR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.47) were more likely to relapse than employed veterans. Homeless vs. independently housed veterans had 3.26 (95% CI: 2.55, 4.17) higher odds of relapse after treatment. Veterans with one arrest vs. none were more likely to relapse (OR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.95). Treatment completion was critical to maintain sobriety, as every other type of discharge led to more than double the odds of relapse. Veterans who received care at 24-hour detox facilities were 1.49 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.80) times more likely to relapse than those at rehabilitative/residential treatment facilities. Classification tree analysis indicated that homelessness upon discharge was the most important predictor in SUD relapse among veterans.CONCLUSION: Aside from numerous challenges that veterans face after leaving military service, SUD relapse is intensified by risk factors such as homelessness, unemployment, and insufficient SUD treatment. As treatment and preventive care for SUD relapse is an active field of study, further research on SUD relapse among homeless veterans is necessary to better understand the epidemiology of substance addiction among this vulnerable population. The findings of this study can inform healthcare policy and practices targeting veteran-tailored treatment programs to improve SUD treatment completion and lower substance use after treatment.",2022,,Mil Med,187,12-Nov,e1422-e1431,,10.1093/milmed/usab280,,#3319,Betancourt 2022,,
"The Acceptability, Engagement, and Feasibility of Mental Health Apps for Marginalized and Underserved Young People: Systematic Review and Qualitative Study","Bear, Holly Alice; Ayala Nunes, Lara; Ramos, Giovanni; Manchanda, Tanya; Fernandes, Blossom; Chabursky, Sophia; Walper, Sabine; Watkins, Edward; Fazel, Mina","BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps may provide an opportunity to deliver mental health resources and interventions in a scalable and cost-effective manner. However, young people from marginalized and underserved groups face numerous and unique challenges to accessing, engaging with, and benefiting from these apps.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to better understand the acceptability (ie, perceived usefulness and satisfaction with an app) and feasibility (ie, the extent to which an app was successfully used) of mental health apps for underserved young people. A secondary aim was to establish whether adaptations can be made to increase the accessibility and inclusivity of apps for these groups.METHODS: We conducted 2 sequential studies, consisting of a systematic literature review of mental health apps for underserved populations followed by a qualitative study with underserved young male participants (n=20; age: mean 19). Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, an electronic search of 5 databases was conducted in 2021. The search yielded 18,687 results, of which 14 articles met the eligibility criteria.RESULTS: The included studies comprised a range of groups, including those affected by homelessness, having physical health conditions, living in low- and middle-income countries, and those with sexual and gender minority identities. Establishing and maintaining user engagement was a pervasive challenge across mental health apps and populations, and dropout was a reported problem among nearly all the included studies. Positive subjective reports of usability, satisfaction, and acceptability were insufficient to determine users' objective engagement.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the significant amount of funding directed to the development of mental health apps, juxtaposed with only limited empirical evidence to support their effectiveness, few apps have been deliberately developed or adapted to meet the heterogeneous needs of marginalized and underserved young people. Before mental health apps are scaled up, a greater understanding is needed of the types of services that more at-risk young people and those in limited-resource settings prefer (eg, standard vs digital) followed by more rigorous and consistent demonstrations of acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Adopting an iterative participatory approach by involving young people in the development and evaluation process is an essential step in enhancing the adoption of any intervention, including apps, in ""real-world"" settings and will support future implementation and sustainability efforts to ensure that marginalized and underserved groups are reached.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42021254241; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=254241.",2024,,J Med Internet Res,26,,e48964,,10.2196/48964,,#3322,Bear 2024,,

The Stories for Change (S4C) Diabetes digital storytelling intervention promotes T2D self-management among Hispanic/Latino people. We describe the S4C protocol and participant baseline characteristics.METHODS: Study eligibility criteria: Hispanic or Latino, age 18-70 years, ≥1 office visit within a year at a participating clinic, T2D diagnosis for ≥6 months, HbA1c ≥ 8%, and intention to continue care at the recruitment clinic. We used a two-group, parallel randomized controlled trial design and an intervention derived through a community-based participatory research approach. All participants received usual diabetes care and two cards describing how to engage healthcare teams and access diabetes-related resources. At baseline, the intervention group additionally viewed the 12-min, intervention video (four stories about diabetes self-management). To encourage subsequent video viewing, participants received five monthly text messages. The messages prompted them to self-rate their motivation and self-efficacy for T2D management.

We aim to explore citizens' opinions about homelessness and to explain the differences in attitudes within the general population of eight European countries: France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.METHODS: A nationally representative telephone survey of European citizens was conducted in 2017. Three domains were investigated: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about homelessness. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a generalized linear model for clustered and weighted samples was used to probe the associations between groups with opposing attitudes.RESULTS: Response rates ranged from 30.4% to 33.5% (N = 5,295). Most respondents (57%) had poor knowledge about homelessness. Respondents who thought the government spent too much on homelessness, people who are homeless should be responsible for housing, people remain homeless by choice, or homelessness keeps capabilities/empowerment intact (regarding meals, family contact, and access to work) clustered together (negative attitudes, 30%). Respondents who were willing to pay taxes, welcomed a shelter, or acknowledged people who are homeless may lack some capabilities (i.e. agreed on discrimination in hiring) made another cluster (positive attitudes, 58%). Respondents living in semi-urban or urban areas (ORs 1.33 and 1.34) and those engaged in practices to support people who are homeless (ORs > 1.4; p<0.005) were more likely to report positive attitudes, whereas those from France and Poland (p<0.001) were less likely to report positive attitudes.CONCLUSION: The majority of European citizens hold positive attitudes towards people who are homeless, however there remain significant differences between and within countries.

Gender Differences in the Predictors of Suicide-related Morbidity Among Veterans Reporting Current Housing Instability,"Montgomery, Ann E.; Dichter, Melissa E.; Blosnich, John R.","BACKGROUND: Veterans experiencing housing instability are at increased risk of suicide. Research is needed to identify gender differences in the predictors of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, particularly among Veterans who are unstably housed.OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to explore whether correlates of suicide-related morbidity among unstably housed Veterans vary by gender and identify implications for improved care for these Veterans.METHODS: The study cohort included 86,325 Veterans who reported current housing instability between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2016. This cross-sectional study assessed differences in demographic and outcome variables by gender using χ2 analyses and a series of multiple logistic regressions predicting suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, stratified by gender.RESULTS: Among unstably housed female Veterans, being younger than 40 years was associated with more than double the odds of having an indicator of suicidal ideation and >12 times the odds of having an indicator of a suicide attempt. The effect sizes associated with age were much less pronounced among unstably housed male Veterans. The presence of mental health and substance use conditions as well as a positive screen for military sexual trauma were associated with increased risk of suicide morbidity among both women and men.CONCLUSIONS: Intervention and prevention among unstably housed Veterans may be complicated by unpredictable living situations; further research should explore tailored interventions to address the complex needs of unstably housed Veterans and how suicide prevention can be woven throughout.",2021,,Med Care,59,,S36-S41,,10.1097/MLR.0000000000001422,,#3334,Montgomery 2021,,
Subjective housing stability in the transition away from homelessness,"Frederick, Tyler; Vitopoulos, Nina; Leon, Scott; Kidd, Sean","Housing stability is a complex concept to measure. One set of factors under consideration are those based on a personal or subjective sense of stability. We explore the variables associated with subjective stability and explore how subjective stability relates to housing stability across time. We use data from longitudinal, mixed methods research with 85 young people exiting homelessness. We find that subjective stability is a meaningful construct that can be validated through qualitative and quantitative data. The construct is primarily linked to indicators of environmental and social wellbeing. Subjective stability is also one of the only variables with a significant relationship to T2 housing stability. Qualitative analysis is used to explore these relationships in more detail. We conclude that subjective stability can provide holistic insight into the complex life circumstances influencing housing stability. However, this strength introduces complexity in that subjective stability appears to be developed in comparison with past experiences, as well as feelings of forward momentum on goals beyond housing.",2022,,J Community Psychol,50,2,1083-1101,,10.1002/jcop.22702,,#3337,Frederick 2022,,
Increasing Heroin-Methamphetamine (Goofball) Use and Related Morbidity Among Seattle Area People Who Inject Drugs,"Glick, Sara N.; Klein, Kathryn S.; Tinsley, Joe; Golden, Matthew R.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Methamphetamine use is increasing in the United States, potentially including the simultaneous injection of methamphetamine with heroin (goofball). We compared demographic, behavioral, contextual, and health factors among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the Seattle area and who reported that their main drug was goofball, heroin, or methamphetamine.METHODS: We used data from 2017 and 2019 cross-sectional surveys of clients at Public Health-Seattle & King County's syringe services program (N = 792).RESULTS: Among PWID participants, 55.3% reported using goofball in the last 3 months, and the proportion reporting goofball as their main drug doubled between 2017 (10.3%) and 2019 (20.1%, P < .001). The goofball group had the highest proportions of people who were aged less than 30, women, homeless or unstably housed, and recently incarcerated. PWID whose main drug was goofball reported considerable health risks and morbidity. Witnessing an opioid overdose was most commonly reported by participants whose main drug was goofball. This group also reported naloxone possession and use in an overdose situation more than other participants. The majority of participants were interested in reducing or stopping their opioid and stimulant use.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Among PWID, using goofball as a main drug doubled over 2 years and was characterized by contextual and individual factors that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality.SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to characterize goofball use as a main drug. Clinical and public health efforts to diminish morbidity associated with opioid use need to integrate interventions that address the co-use of methamphetamine.

Access to health and rights of children in street situations and working children: a scoping review,"Jörgensen, Eva; Napier-Raman, Sharanya; Macleod, Shona; Seth, Rajeev; Goodman, Michael; Howard, Neil; Einarsdóttir, Jónína; Banerjee, Meghendra; Raman, Shanti","BACKGROUND: Street and working children (SWC) and young people (YP) are highly vulnerable to violence, exploitation, hazardous environments and human rights violations. While the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the International Labour Organisation provide some guidance, there is limited information on their right to healthcare. This study aims to identify enablers and barriers to healthcare access for SWC and document associated rights violations.METHODS: From 2000 to the present, we conducted systematic searches for SWC (0-18 years) in databases including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EBSCO, PUBMED and PROQUEST, using broad search terms related to street children, working children, healthcare access and rights. The searches were supplemented by grey literature and hand searches. Two independent reviewers finalised the included studies, and data were analysed using a rights-based framework with narrative analysis and thematisation.RESULTS: The initial search yielded 7346 articles (5972 for street children and 1374 for working children), with 35 studies (18 for street children and 17 for working children) included in the review. Most studies on working children (13/17) focused on trafficking/commercial exploitation. Studies were predominantly from Africa, followed by the USA, Asia, the UK and Canada, with only two employing a rights framework. SWC face barriers such as cost, distance, visibility/accessibility of services, stigma, seclusion, threats of violence, lack of legal documents, crisis-oriented healthcare use and self-medication. Enablers included agency, self-efficacy, positive relationships with adults and proactive healthcare use when accessible. Emergency departments are frequently accessed by SWC, indicating a need for healthcare professionals to be trained and sensitised. Holistic and comprehensive healthcare is essential.CONCLUSION: Significant research gaps exist, with many SWC populations under-represented. SWC share healthcare access barriers with other marginalised groups. Healthcare for SWC must be tailored to their unique needs and strengths and be holistic and trauma-informed.",2024,,BMJ Paediatr Open,8,1,e002870,,10.1136/bmjpo-2024-002870,,#3343,Jörgensen 2024,,
The use of arts-based methodologies and methods with young people with complex psychosocial needs: A systematic narrative review,"Nathan, Sally; Hodgins, Michael; Wirth, Jonathan; Ramirez, Jacqueline; Walker, Natasha; Cullen, Patricia","BACKGROUND: Arts-based methodologies and methods (ABM) can elicit rich and meaningful data with seldom-heard groups and empower participants in research. Young people with complex psychosocial needs could be better engaged in research using arts-based approaches to overcome communication and literacy issues as well as distrust of those with power, including researchers. A critical review of the use and impact of ABM among this population is timely. The purpose of this review is to synthesize and examine the experience and use of ABM with young people with complex psychosocial needs.METHODS: A systematic narrative literature review was conducted with a search of the literature from 2009 to 2021. All abstracts were reviewed independently by two authors and full papers were screened for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data synthesis focused on a descriptive numerical summary and a thematic analysis focused on key patterns across papers relating to the review objectives.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 25 papers were included. The most common issues of focus were mental health (n = 10) and homelessness (n = 11) and methods using Photovoice (n = 12) and Body Mapping (n = 5). Individual interview data (n = 20) were the most commonly analysed, followed by created works (n = 19). Less than half the studies involved young people in the interpretation of the data collected. Knowledge translation was not described in almost half the studies, with public exhibits (n = 7) and forums with service providers (n = 4) being the most common activities. Key themes across the studies were valued over traditional methods in eliciting data, ABM as an approach to engage these young people in research and the impact of the use of ABM on participants and on key stakeholders through knowledge translation.CONCLUSIONS: The growing field of ABM presents opportunities to enhance research with young people with complex psychosocial needs by promoting meaningful exploration of experiences, engaging participants in research and strengthening knowledge translation. The involvement of young people in the interpretation of data and ensuring that knowledge translation occurs are key areas for future attention.PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The findings of this review will inform future research to improve the engagement of young people with complex psychosocial needs in research and promote power sharing between researchers and research participants.",2023,,Health Expect,26,2,795-805,,10.1111/hex.13705,,#3346,Nathan 2023,,
"Health Care Access and Use Among Children & Adolescents Exposed to Parental Incarceration-United States, 2019","Khazanchi, Rohan; Heard-Garris, Nia J.; Winkelman, Tyler N. A.","OBJECTIVE: The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with spillover impacts on 5 million children with an incarcerated parent. Children exposed to parental incarceration (PI) have suboptimal health care access, use, and outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. However, little is known about their access and utilization during childhood. We evaluated relationships between PI and health care use and access throughout childhood and adolescence.METHODS: We analyzed the nationally representative 2019 National Health Interview Survey Child Sample to examine cross-sectional associations between exposure to incarceration of a residential caregiver, access to care, and health care use among children aged 2-17. Respondents were asked about measures of preventive care access, unmet needs due to cost, and acute care use over the last year. We estimated changes associated with PI exposure using multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, parental education, family structure, rurality, income, insurance status, and disability.RESULTS: Of 7405 sample individuals, 467 (weighted 6.2% [95% CI 5.5-6.9]) were exposed to PI. In adjusted analyses to produce national estimates, exposure to PI was associated with an additional 2.2 million children lacking a usual source of care, 2 million with forgone dental care needs, 1.2 million with delayed mental health care needs, and 865,000 with forgone mental health care needs.CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PI was associated with worse access to a usual source of care and unmet dental and mental health care needs. Our findings highlight the need for early intervention by demonstrating that these barriers emerge during childhood and adolescence.",2023,,Acad Pediatr,23,2,464-472,,10.1016/j.acap.2022.10.001,,#3349,Khazanchi 2023,,

Our Voice in a rural community: empowering Colombian adolescents to advocate for school community well-being through citizen science,"Montes, Felipe; Guerra, Ana María; Higuera-Mendieta, Diana; De La Vega-Taboada, Eduardo; King, Abby C.; Banchoff, Ann; Maturana, Augusto César Rodríguez; Sarmiento, Olga L.","BACKGROUND: Santa Ana is home to an Afro-descendant rural population of the island of Barú in Cartagena, Colombia. While a popular area for tourism, Santa Ana's population is affected by multidimensional poverty, precarious work conditions, homelessness, broken streets and sewer systems, limited quality education, and a lack of recreation and sport spaces. While Santa Ana's Community Action Board aims to unify efforts and resources to solve these problems, the state's capacity to meet the requirements of the Board is limited.METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between healthy lifestyles and characteristics of Santa Ana's school using the Our Voice Citizen Science Research Method. This systemic approach combines information and communication technologies with group facilitation to empower adolescents to: 1) collect and discuss data about factors in their local environments that facilitate or hinder well-being within their school community; 2) identify relevant local stakeholders who could help to address the issues identified; and 3) advocate collectively for local improvements to support increased well-being at a community level.RESULTS: Eleven citizen scientists ages 13 to 17 years from the science club of Institución Educativa Santa Ana were recruited and together conducted 11 walks within the school to collect data about the facilitators and barriers to student well-being. They identified barriers to well-being related to school infrastructure, furniture, bathrooms, and sense of belonging. They then advocated with school stakeholders and reached agreements on concrete actions to address identified barriers, including fostering a culture among students of caring for school property and presenting their findings to the community action board. This methodology allowed the community to realize how students can become agents of change and take collective action when motivated by solution-oriented methodologies such as Our Voice. Project ripple effects, including greater empowerment and participation in collective actions by students, also were observed.CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of the school's built environment in the well-being of students in rural areas. The Our Voice method provided the opportunity to inform school-based interventions, and promoted ripple effects that expanded productive dialogue to the community level and generated systemic actions involving actors outside of the school community.",2022,,BMC Public Health,22,1,2411,,10.1186/s12889-022-14559-x,,#3355,Montes 2022,,
Mortality among tuberculosis patients in New York City,"Hood, G.; Trieu, L.; Ahuja, S. D.","OBJECTIVES: To quantify tuberculosis (TB) related mortality among TB patients in New York City (NYC), NY, USA, and identify risk factors associated with TB-related mortality.DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of verified TB patients in NYC, 2004-2013. NYC Office of Vital Statistics death certificate data and TB surveillance data were matched. Death certificate data were used to identify TB-related deaths. Risk factors for TB-related death for US-born and non-US-born populations were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: Of 8209 TB patients in NYC, 168 (2%) suffered TB-related deaths before or during anti-tuberculosis treatment. Of these, 62% occurred among non-US-born patients, and 38% occurred among US-born patients. Among the latter, TB-related death was associated with increased age (65 vs. 18-44 years, adjusted OR [aOR] 8.27, 95%CI 3.47-19.71), being culture-positive (aOR 6.79, 95%CI 2.10-21.97), and having both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary disease (aOR 5.06, 95%CI 1.91-13.40).

This study aimed to understand factors in childhood and adolescence that shape the vulnerability to underage sex work initiation.DESIGN: Building on previous qualitative research with this cohort, analysis of behavioural-biological cross-sectional data using hierarchical logistic regression.PARTICIPANTS AND MEASURES: FSWs aged 18-45 years were randomly selected from seven Sex Workers Outreach Programme clinics in Nairobi, and between June and December 2019, completed a baseline behavioural-biological survey. Measurement tools included WHO Adverse Childhood Experiences, Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test and questionnaires on sociodemographic information, sexual risk behaviours and gender-based violence. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were conducted using hierarchical modelling.RESULTS: Of the 1003 FSWs who participated in the baseline survey (response rate 96%), 176 (17.5%) initiated sex work while underage (<18 years). In the multivariable analysis, factors associated with entering sex work while underage included incomplete secondary school education (aOR=2.82; 95% CI=1.69 to 4.73), experiencing homelessness as a child (aOR=2.20; 95% CI=1.39 to 3.48), experiencing childhood physical or sexual violence (aOR=1.85; 95% CI=1.09 to 3.15), young age of sexual debut (≤15 years) (aOR=5.03; 95% CI=1.83 to 13.79) and being childless at time of sex work initiation (aOR=9.80; 95% CI=3.60 to 26.66).CONCLUSIONS: Lower education level and childhood homelessness, combined with sexual violence and sexual risk behaviours in childhood, create pathways to underage initiation into sex work.

"Co-occurring homelessness, justice involvement, opioid dependence and psychosis: a cross-sectoral data linkage study","Tweed, Emily J.; Leyland, Alastair H.; Morrison, David S.; Katikireddi, S. Vittal","BACKGROUND: Administrative data offer unique opportunities for researching experiences which pose barriers to participation in primary research and household surveys. Experiencing multiple social disadvantages is associated with very poor health outcomes, but little is known about how often this occurs and what combinations are most common. We linked administrative data across public services to create a novel population cohort containing information on experiences of homelessness, justice involvement, opioid dependence and psychosis.METHODS: We securely linked administrative data from (i) a population register derived from general practitioner registrations; (ii) local authority homelessness applications; (iii) prison records; (iv) criminal justice social work reports; (v) community dispensing for opioid substitution therapy; and (vi) a psychosis clinical register, for people aged ≥18 years resident in Glasgow, Scotland between 01 April 2010 and 31 March 2014. We estimated period prevalence and compared demographic characteristics for different combinations.RESULTS: Of 536 653 individuals in the cohort, 28 112 (5.2%) had at least one of the experiences of interest during the study period and 5178 (1.0%) had more than one. Prevalence of individual experiences varied from 2.4% (homelessness) to 0.7% (psychosis). The proportion of people with multiple co-occurring experiences was highest for imprisonment (50%) and lowest for psychosis (14%). Most combinations showed a predominance of men living in the most deprived areas of Scotland.CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectoral record linkage to study multiple forms of social disadvantage showed that co-occurrence of these experiences was relatively common.

Cumulative exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including neglect, abuse and household dysfunction before age 18, has been found to be independently associated with both an increased risk of social exclusion and adverse health and mortality outcomes in adulthood.Despite this, the impact of ACEs on health and mortality within socially excluded populations is poorly understood.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, PsycINFO, Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts and Criminal Justice Database for peer-reviewed studies measuring ACEs and their impact on health and mortality in socially excluded populations.Three review questions will guide our data extraction and analysis. First, what is the prevalence of ACEs among people experiencing social exclusion in included studies? Second, what is the relationship between ACEs and health and mortality outcomes among people experiencing social exclusion? Does resilience modify the strength of association between ACEs and health outcomes among people experiencing social exclusion?We will meta-analyse the relationship between ACE exposure and health outcomes classified into six a prior categories: (1) substance use disorders; (2) sexual and reproductive health; (3) communicable diseases; (4) mental illness; (5) non-communicable diseases and (6) violence victimisation, perpetration and injury. If there are insufficient studies for meta-analysis, we will conduct a narrative synthesis. Study quality will be assessed using the MethodologicAl STandards for Epidemiological Research scale.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Our findings will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal, in presentations at academic conferences and in a brief report for policy makers and service providers.

Increase in pregabalin recreational use in adolescents in France,"Dufayet, Laurene; Care, Weniko; Deheul, Sylvie; Laborde-Casterot, Hervé; Nisse, Patrick; French PCC Research Group; Langrand, Jerome; Vodovar, Dominique","INTRODUCTION: Misuse/abuse of pregabalin is increasing worldwide. French Poison Control Centers (PCCs) recently received several unusual calls regarding the recreational use of pregabalin in adolescents. This study aims to describe this new and specific population of pregabalin misusers.METHODS: We extracted all cases of pregabalin intentional exposures reported to the French National Database of Poisonings (FNDP) from 2004 to 2020. We compared the proportion of recreational exposure to pregabalin between adolescents (10-17 years) and adults (>18 years). We reviewed all cases of pregabalin recreational exposures in adolescent in order to describe the characteristics of this population.RESULTS: During the study period, 382 cases of acute intentional exposure to pregabalin were reported in adolescents and 1188 in adults, 94/382 (24.6%) and 43/1188 (3.6%) were pregabalin recreational use, respectively (p < .0001). Almost all cases of pregabalin recreational use in adolescent were reported from 2018 (86/94; 91%). Most of those adolescent patients were males (male/female ratio - 5.3:1) and the median age was 15 years (range: 11-17.8). They were homeless or living in migrant shelters in most of the cases (73/90, 81%). Two-third of these exposures (62/94; 66%) involved other toxicant(s) than pregabalin. Most of the patients remains asymptomatic (10/94; 11%), or developed minor to moderate neurological symptoms (76/94; 81%). Eight developed severe symptoms (8/94; 8%) including coma (5/8) or generalized seizures (2/8). Five patients (5/8) required oro-tracheal intubation. No fatality was reported.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a sharp increase in pregabalin recreational use in adolescents in France.

"Public restrooms, periods, and people experiencing homelessness: An assessment of public toilets in high needs areas of Manhattan, New York","Maroko, Andrew R.; Hopper, Kim; Gruer, Caitlin; Jaffe, Maayan; Zhen, Erica; Sommer, Marni","Access to safe, clean water and sanitation is globally recognized as essential for public health. Public toilets should be accessible to all members of a society, without social or physical barriers preventing usage. A public toilet facility's design and upkeep should offer privacy and safety, ensure cleanliness, provide required sanitation-related resources, and be gender equitable, including enabling comfortable and safe management of menstruation. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) refers to the need to ensure that girls, women and all people who menstruate have access to clean menstrual products, privacy to change the materials as often as needed, soap and water for washing the body as required, and access to facilities to dispose of used materials. Challenges around menstruation faced by people experiencing homelessness, which tend to be greater than those facing the general population, include inadequate toilet and bathing facilities, affordability issues around menstrual products, and menstrual stigma. Public toilets are a vital resource for managing menstruation, particularly for vulnerable populations without reliable access to private, safe, and clean spaces and menstrual products. This mixed-methods study sought to: 1) understand the lived experiences of MHM among people experiencing homelessness in New York City with respect to public toilets; 2) describe general and MHM-related characteristics of public toilets in high need areas of Manhattan and analyze their interrelationships; and 3) examine the associations among neighborhood-level demographics and the public toilet characteristics in those areas. Qualitative methods included key informant interviews (n = 15) and in-depth interviews (n = 22) with people with experience living on the street or in shelters, which were analyzed using Malterud's 'systematic text condensation' for thematic cross-case analysis. Quantitative methods included audits and analyses of public toilet facilities (n = 25) using traditional statistics (e.g., Spearman's correlations) and spatial analyses (e.g., proximity buffers). Qualitative findings suggest cleanliness, access to restrooms, and availability of resources are critical issues for the participants or prospective users. Quantitative analyses revealed insufficiently provided, maintained, and resourced public toilets for managing menstruation in high-needs areas. Findings also suggest that toilets with more MHM-related resource availability, such as menstrual products and toilet stall disposal bins, were more difficult to access. Neighborhood-level characteristics showed a potential environmental injustice, as areas characterized by higher socioeconomic status are associated with more access to MHM-specific resources in public restrooms, as well as better overall quality.",2021,,PLoS One,16,6,e0252946,,10.1371/journal.pone.0252946,,#3373,Maroko 2021,,

Reducing the drivers of drug demand in English towns by understanding risk and resilience in the community and developing a framework for partnership action: a mixed methods analysis,"Whitehead, Robert; Wells, Catherine","BACKGROUND: Substance misuse has extensive effects on individuals and communities, ranging from the poor health of people who use drugs to the pressure placed on health care, social services, and the criminal justice system. Strategies to curtail the supply and demand of drugs and reduce these effects typically focus on supply, with less emphasis placed on the drivers of demand. We piloted and evaluated a public health approach for understanding the drivers and effects of substance misuse in a local area, and how these might be targeted for prevention through multi-agency partnership action.METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed methods analysis was conducted, using multi-agency data. 3 years of data provided by criminal justice agencies (police, youth justice, and probation), drug treatment services, social care, education, and hospitals were used to profile the local demand and effect of drugs on individuals and communities in a coastal town in southern England. The experiences of local professionals who support people who misuse drugs, or people affected by drug misuse, were collected via an online survey that was disseminated to relevant partnership organisations, including homelessness charities and drug treatment providers. A public health framework identifying relevant risk and resilience factors in the community was developed by combining the multi-agency data and survey responses The methodological efficacy of this approach to inform partnership action was evaluated via a survey with the project's stakeholders.FINDINGS: Community housing, mental health, and cycles entrenching substance misuse were identified as risk factors that increase individual-level, interpersonal-level, and community-level vulnerabilities to the harms of drug misuse, violence, and exploitation. Evaluation found this mixed-methods analysis for understanding risk and resilience to be a valuable approach to enable public health and community safety leaders to develop a framework for partnership action to reduce the negative effects of drug demand in the community.INTERPRETATION: Analysis of multi-agency data helped to further a shared understanding in local partners of the drivers and effects of drug demand at a local level; and, through a public health lens, clearly identified the role that local organisations can play in minimising the harms of substance misuse and exploitation.FUNDING: No funding received.",2022,,Lancet,400 Suppl 1,,S11,,10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02221-8,,#3379,Whitehead 2022,,

The authors compared groups on baseline demographic characteristics, family and living situation, clinical measures, and pathways to care.RESULTS: Of 1,129 eligible participants, 12% were persistently symptomatic through follow-up. Being medication nonadherent, being homeless, having a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and having a longer duration between symptom onset and program enrollment were predictive of persistent symptoms during the first year of CSC.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that despite intensive treatment, severe symptoms in young people with psychosis may persist because of economic barriers, treatment delays, and lack of stability.",2022,,Psychiatr Serv,73,1,92-95,,10.1176/appi.ps.202000821,,#3382,Zambrano 2022,,
Development and Validation of a Clinical Risk Score to Predict Hospitalization Within 30 Days of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Diagnosis,"Aboumrad, Maya; Zwain, Gabrielle; Smith, Jeremy; Neupane, Nabin; Powell, Ethan; Dempsey, Brendan; Reyes, Carolina; Satram, Sacha; Young-Xu, Yinong","INTRODUCTION: Early identification of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for hospitalization may help to mitigate disease burden by allowing healthcare systems to conduct sufficient resource and logistical planning in the event of case surges. We sought to develop and validate a clinical risk score that uses readily accessible information at testing to predict individualized 30-day hospitalization risk following COVID-19 diagnosis.METHODS: We assembled a retrospective cohort of U.S. Veterans Health Administration patients (age ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. We screened patient characteristics using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator logistic regression and constructed the risk score using characteristics identified as most predictive for hospitalization. Patients diagnosed before November 1, 2020, comprised the development cohort, while those diagnosed on or after November 1, 2020, comprised the validation cohort. We assessed risk score discrimination by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test. This study was approved by the Veteran's Institutional Review Board of Northern New England at the White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Reference no.:1473972-1).RESULTS: The development and validation cohorts comprised 11,473 and 12,970 patients, of whom 4,465 (38.9%) and 3,669 (28.3%) were hospitalized, respectively. The independent predictors for hospitalization included in the risk score were increasing age, male sex, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, homelessness, nursing home/long-term care residence, unemployed or retired status, fever, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, cough, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Model discrimination and calibration was good for the development (AUROC = 0.80; HL P-value = .05) and validation (AUROC = 0.80; HL P-value = .31) cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: The prediction tool developed in this study demonstrated that it could identify patients with COVID-19 who are at risk for hospitalization. This could potentially inform clinicians and policymakers of patients who may benefit most from early treatment interventions and help healthcare systems anticipate capacity surges.",2023,,Mil Med,188,4-Mar,e833-e840,,10.1093/milmed/usab415,,#3385,Aboumrad 2023,,

The success rates in the treatment of tuberculosis are suboptimal. Objective. To identify associated factors with the lack of success of antituberculosis treatment in patients with a tuberculosis treatment history. Materials and methods. We performed a retrospective, analytical, observational, and cohort study of patients reentering the Mycobacterium program in Cali, Colombia. We included patients over 15 years old with pulmonary tuberculosis between 2015 and 2019 and a history of tuberculosis treatment. Patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis were excluded. Results. A total of 605 patients with a treatment history were included, 60% due to unfinished treatment and 40% due to relapse. Compared to patients reentering due to relapse (ORa=2.34, CI=1.62-3.38), the independent variables associated with treatment failure at discharge were homelessness (ORa=2.45, CI=1.54-3.89), substance dependence (ORa=1.95, CI=1.24-3.05), tuberculosis/HIV coinfection (ORa=1.69, CI=1.00-2.86), diabetes (ORa=1.89, CI=1.29-2.77), and unfinished previous tuberculosis treatment due to follow-up loss, abandonment, or other causes. Programmatic variables favoring treatment success were voluntary HIV testing counseling (p<0.001) and HIV testing (p<0.001). Conclusion. Homelessness, substance dependence, tuberculosis/HIV coinfection, diabetes, and incomplete previous treatment due to loss to follow-up, abandonment, or treatment failure hindered the success of antituberculosis. These characteristics should be identified and addressed during the initial care of patients reentering treatment for tuberculosis.",2023,,Biomedica,43,3,360-373,,10.7705/biomedica.6961,,#3388,Varela 2023,,
Socioeconomic Indicators of Treatment Prognosis for Adults With Depression: A Systematic Review and Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis,"Buckman, Joshua E.

Understanding this association would aid in the clinical management of depression.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether employment status, financial strain, housing status, and educational attainment inform prognosis for adults treated for depression in primary care, independent of treatment and after accounting for clinical prognostic factors.DATA SOURCES: The Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases were searched from database inception to October 8, 2021.STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials that used the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R; the most common comprehensive screening and diagnostic measure of depressive and anxiety symptoms in primary care randomized clinical trials), measured socioeconomic factors at baseline, and sampled patients with unipolar depression who sought treatment for depression from general physicians/practitioners or who scored 12 or more points on the CIS-R. Exclusion criteria included patients with depression secondary to a personality or psychotic disorder or neurologic condition, studies of bipolar or psychotic depression, studies that included children or adolescents, and feasibility studies. Studies were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 reviewers.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted and cleaned by data managers for each included study, further cleaned by multiple reviewers, and cross-checked by study chief investigators. Risk of bias and quality were assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tools, respectively. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) reporting guidelines.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depressive symptoms at 3 to 4 months after baseline.RESULTS: This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis identified 9 eligible studies that provided individual patient data for 4864 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.5 (14.0) years; 3279 women [67.4%]). The 2-stage random-effects meta-analysis end point depressive symptom scale scores were 28% (95% CI, 20%-36%) higher for unemployed patients than for employed patients and 18% (95% CI, 6%-30%) lower for patients who were homeowners than for patients living with family or friends, in hostels, or homeless, which were equivalent to 4.2 points (95% CI, 3.6-6.2 points) and 2.9 points (95% CI, 1.1-4.9 points) on the Beck Depression Inventory II, respectively. Financial strain and educational attainment were associated with prognosis independent of treatment, but unlike employment and housing status, there was little evidence of associations after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that unemployment was associated with a poor prognosis whereas home ownership was associated with improved prognosis. These differences were clinically important and independent of the type of treatment received. Interventions that address employment or housing difficulties could improve outcomes for patients with depression.",2022,,JAMA Psychiatry,79,5,406-416,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0100,,#3391,Buckman 2022,,

Routine Care involved assistance scheduling a post-discharge appointment with a primary care provider that often partnered with the hospital where the initial encounter occurred.MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was a binary indicator of death or additional hospital encounters within 90 days of initial discharge. Secondary outcomes included any additional hospital encounters, and counts of hospital encounters, over 180 days.KEY RESULTS: Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to TC intervention and 164 to Routine Care; 34.6% were uninsured, 49.7% had Medicaid, and 57.4% were homeless or lived in a high-poverty area. There was no significant difference between arms in the 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.13). However, TC patients had 37% and 35% lower probability of any inpatient admission over 90 days (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91) and 180 days (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.89), respectively. Over 180 days, TC patients had 42% fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.37-0.90).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients randomized to a patient-centered transitional care intervention, there was no significant reduction in 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters.

Gender differences in first episode psychosis: Some arguments to develop gender specific treatment strategies,"Salvadé, Aude; Golay, Philippe; Abrahamyan, Lilith; Bonnarel, Vincent; Solida, Alessandra; Alameda, Luis; Ramain, Julie; Conus, Philippe","INTRODUCTION: Some aspects of gender differences in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have been studied, especially in cross-sectional designs and with a short-term follow-up. However, only a few studies have considered the evolution during the follow-up of SSD patients according to their gender. In this study, we explore gender differences from the time of entry in an early intervention program for psychosis, up to three years follow-up.METHODS: We conducted a prospective study including a cohort of 474 patients treated at the Treatment and Early Intervention in Psychosis (TIPP) program, 319 men and 155 women, having presented a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Data regarding premorbid and baseline sociodemographic, psychopathological and patient functioning, were collected. These data were reassessed longitudinally after 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after entry in TIPP.RESULTS: Regarding premorbid and baseline characteristics, woman developed threshold symptoms of a FEP 1 year later than men on average. Women were more likely to be married, men were more likely to live in pension or care home facility or to be homeless. Women displayed a higher rate of history of suicide attempts and exposure to childhood trauma, while men were more likely to have a forensic history, a history of abuse of alcohol and cannabis as well as a dependency to cannabis at the time of entry in TIPP. Regarding evolution, men were more prone to violent acts and were less likely to decrease their usage of substances. The longitudinal analysis highlighted that men displayed greater negative symptoms over the entire treatment period, lower functioning after 6 months and on all assessment points after. Both genders displayed similar rate of improvement in these 3 dimensions over time.CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that there are some gender differences in the early phase of psychosis that may require differentiation of assessment and treatment to improve recovery.",2024,,Schizophr Res,271,,300-308,,10.1016/j.schres.2024.07.046,,#3397,Salvadé 2024,,

These approaches may be beneficial outside of these populations.METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, PEDro, OTSeeker, and NIOSHTIC for trials including unemployed people with any condition and including severe mental illness if combined with other co-morbidities or other specific circumstances (e.g., homelessness). We excluded trials where inclusion was based on severe mental illness alone. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias (RoB v2.0) and four reviewers extracted data. We assessed rates of competitive employment as compared to traditional vocational rehabilitation or waiting list/services as usual.FINDINGS: Ten randomised controlled trials (913 participants) were included. Supported employment was more effective than control interventions for improving competitive employment in seven trials: in people with affective disorders [risk ratio (RR) 10.61 (1.49, 75.38)]; mental disorders and justice involvement [RR 4.44 (1.36,14.46)]; veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [RR 2.73 (1.64, 4.54)]; formerly incarcerated veterans [RR 2.17 (1.09, 4.33)]; people receiving methadone treatment [RR 11.5 (1.62, 81.8)]; veterans with spinal cord injury at 12 months [RR 2.46 (1.16, 5.22)] and at 24 months [RR 2.81 (1.98, 7.37)]; and young people not in employment, education, or training [RR 5.90 (1.91-18.19)]. Three trials did not show significant benefits from supported employment: populations of workers with musculoskeletal injuries [RR 1.38 (1.00, 1.89)]; substance abuse [RR 1.85 (0.65, 5.41)]; and formerly homeless people with mental illness [RR 1.55 (0.76, 3.15)]. Supported employment interventions may be beneficial to people from more diverse populations than those with severe mental illness alone. Defining competitive employment and increasing (and standardising) measurement of non-vocational outcomes may help to improve research in this area.",2021,,Prim Health Care Res Dev,22,,e79,,10.1017/S1463423621000827,,#3400,Probyn 2021,,

We investigated the impact of COVID-19 on PEH compared with the general population in LA County.METHODS: We calculated crude COVID-19 mortality rates per 100 000 population and mortality rates adjusted for age, race, and sex/gender among PEH and compared them with the general population in LA County from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021.RESULTS: Among adults aged ≥18 years, the crude mortality rate per 100 000 population among PEH was 20% higher than among the general LA County population (348.7 vs 287.6). After adjusting for age, the mortality rate among PEH was 570.7 per 100 000 population. PEH had nearly twice the risk of dying from COVID-19 as people in the general LA County population; PEH aged 18-29 years had almost 8 times the risk of dying compared with their peers in the general LA County population.

Psychosocial mediators of perceived stigma and suicidal ideation among transgender women,"Kota, Krishna Kiran; Salazar, Laura F.; Culbreth, Rachel E.; Crosby, Richard A.; Jones, Jamal","BACKGROUND: Transgender women (TGW) in the U.S. experience high rates of stigma, depression, and elevated rates of suicide. This study examined correlates of suicidal ideation and estimated the conditional indirect effects of perceived stigma and psychosocial mediators on suicidal ideation.METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, TGW (N = 92) were recruited through snowball sampling in Atlanta, Georgia. Structured interviews were conducted. Suicidal ideation was assessed by combining two variables that measured suicidal thoughts. Logistic regression models were performed to identify the potential risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation. We examined hypothesized psychosocial factors, including anxiety, depression, psychosocial impact of gender minority status, and substance use behaviors as potential mediators for the relationship between perceived stigma and suicidal ideation. All models were controlled for age, race, education, and homelessness.RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was reported by 33% (N = 30) of the study participants. In multivariable analysis, suicidal ideation was associated with sexual abuse (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.10-9.30), anxiety (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.10-2.73), family verbal abuse (AOR = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.10-8.40), stranger verbal abuse (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.02-10.08), and psychosocial impact of gender minority status (AOR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.81-6.46). Partner support was found to be the protective factor for suicidal ideation (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.13-0.90). In the mediation analysis, the psychosocial impact of gender minority status mediated the relationship between perceived stigma and suicidal ideation. The estimated conditional indirect effect was 0.46, (95% CI = 0.12-1.11).CONCLUSION: Interventions that aim to reduce suicidal behaviors among TGW should address stigma, psychosocial impact of gender minority status, and different forms of violence and abuse.",2020,,BMC Public Health,20,1,125,,10.1186/s12889-020-8177-z,,#3406,Kota 2020,,
Understanding Contraceptive Needs of Women Who Inject Drugs in Orange County: A Qualitative Study,"Florsheim, Orli K.; Augustine, Dallas; Van Ligten, Megan M.; Thiel de Bocanegra, Heike; Perry, Rachel","OBJECTIVES: Women with opioid use disorder experience higher rates of unintended pregnancy compared with the general US population. Our aim was to examine the factors that may affect access to desired contraception for women who use injection drugs.METHODS: Using purposive sampling, we conducted semi-structured interviews pertaining to contraceptive use with 14 women ages 18 to 44 who were current users of injection drugs living in Orange County, CA between March and December 2019. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using grounded theory.RESULTS: Participants discussed logistical barriers, including homelessness and lack of transportation, as well as perceived barriers, such as a belief in the inability to become pregnant while using drugs, that affect access to contraceptive care. Women also discussed the factors that motivate them to use contraception despite these barriers, including the desire for sobriety before becoming pregnant and fear of harming a fetus while using substances. Some participants expressed feeling uncomfortable disclosing substance use to their healthcare providers out of concern for stigmatization. Several points of access for contraceptive care were elucidated, including visits for primary and postpartum care, as well as in carceral spaces. Finally, participants expressed a desire to obtain contraceptive services at a local syringe exchange program due to trusting relationships with providers and increased ease of access.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight several causative factors for the unmet contraceptive need among women who use injection drugs, and suggest that syringe exchange programs represent a unique access point for the provision of contraceptive care for this population.",2021,,J Addict Med,15,6,498-503,,10.1097/ADM.0000000000000795,,#3409,Florsheim 2021,,
The effect of a no-cost contraceptive initiative on method selection by women with housing insecurity,"Gawron, Lori M.; Simmons, Rebecca G.; Sanders, Jessica N.; Myers, Kyl; Gundlapalli, Adi V.; Turok, David K.","OBJECTIVES: To compare the sociodemographic characteristics of participants in a contraceptive initiative by housing security and determine the association between housing insecurity on contraceptive method selection before and after the removal of cost.STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional assessment includes 4,327 reproductive-aged participants in the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative who sought new contraceptive services and reported housing status at enrollment. HER Salt Lake prospectively explored the impact of improved contraceptive access on socioeconomic outcomes in Salt Lake County (USA). For six months (September 2015-March 2016) we collected control data, which included clinic standard-of-care cost-sharing. The intervention started March 2016, and provided no-cost contraception services and unlimited opportunities for method switching over the subsequent three years.RESULTS: There were 964 (22%) housing-insecure participants. Compared to those with stable housing, housing-insecure individuals more commonly identified as a sexual minority, received public assistance and lacked health insurance. Housing-insecure women preferentially selected long-acting reversible contraception during the control period (aOR 1.60; 95%CI 1.01-2.56), but method selection equalized across housing status during the intervention.CONCLUSIONS: When cost is not a barrier, all women desire a comprehensive selection of contraceptive methods, regardless of housing security. Contraceptive clients in this vulnerable population need interventions which address access barriers to all methods to support reproductive planning.IMPLICATIONS: Unintended pregnancy during housing insecurity may result in homelessness. This study found housing-insecure women desire access to all contraceptive methods, not just long acting reversible contraception. Integration of comprehensive family planning initiatives into efforts to address homelessness is essential to support this vulnerable population in their reproductive planning.",2020,,Contraception,101,3,205-209,,10.1016/j.contraception.2019.11.003,,#3412,Gawron 2020,,

Faculty, nursing, and pharmacist students, educated 477 participants, aged 18-80 years, on the risk factors associated with untreated hypertension. Then, participants self-completed the consented demographic survey questionnaire. Finally, the sitting blood pressure (BP) was recorded three times based on a standardized procedure, using Omron BPN monitor with cuff.RESULTS: Seven pharmacy students, nine nursing students, two registered nurses, five registered pharmacists, and two medical doctors collaboratively provided health education to the homeless community and screened their sitting BP. 390/477 (81.8%) of participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. Participants (54.7%) of the reported education level was at the high School level or less. More than the half of the participants (average age of 51 ± 13 years) had hypertension (median SBP/DBP ≥ 130/82.7 mmHg), respectively. The prevalence of hypertension for the overall cohort was 61.52% (95% CI, 56.59-66.35).

Characterizing the HIV Care Continuum and Identifying Barriers and Facilitators to HIV Diagnosis and Viral Suppression Among Black Transgender Women in the United States,"Bukowski, Leigh A.; Chandler, Cristian J.; Creasy, Stephanie L.; Matthews, Derrick D.; Friedman, Mackey R.; Stall, Ronald D.","BACKGROUND: Although black transgender women (BTW) experience high prevalence of HIV in the United States, no characterization of the HIV care continuum exists for this population. This study addresses this gap by (1) characterizing the HIV care continuum, and (2) exploring correlates of HIV diagnosis and viral suppression among a community-based sample of BTW.METHODS: Data came from Promoting Our Worth, Equality, and Resilience (POWER). From 2014 to 2017, POWER recruited BTW who attended Black Pride events in 6 U.S. cities. Participants completed a behavioral health survey and were offered onsite HIV testing. Simple frequencies were used to characterize the HIV care continuum, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify correlates of HIV diagnosis and viral suppression.RESULTS: A total of 422 BTW provided completed data for our analysis, 45.0% of whom were living with HIV. Over half of the HIV-positive BTW (51.4%) reported being undiagnosed at the time of survey, and 24.5% reported viral suppression. Incarceration and a lack of access to medical care were significantly and positively associated with an undiagnosed HIV-positive status in multivariable models. Incarceration, homelessness, polydrug use, physical assault, intimate partner violence, and current hormone use were significantly and negatively associated with viral suppression in multivariable models.CONCLUSIONS: Developing and implementing interventions that address timely HIV diagnosis may assist in informing the HIV disparity among BTW in the United States.

Synthetic cannabinoid use in psychiatric patients and relationship to hospitalisation: A retrospective electronic case register study,"Hobbs, Melissa; Patel, Rashmi; Morrison, Paul D.; Kalk, Nicola; Stone, James M.","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cannabis use has been associated with psychosis and with poor outcome in patients with mental illness. Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) have been suggested to pose an even greater risk to mental health, but the effect on clinical outcome has not been directly measured. In this study, we aimed to investigate the demographics and hospitalisation of psychiatric patients who were SC users.METHODS: We searched the Biomedical Research Centre Clinical Record Interactive Search register for SC users and age- and sex-matched SC non-users who had been psychiatric patients under the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust. We recorded diagnosis, homelessness, cannabis use and the total number of days admitted as an inpatient to secondary and tertiary mental-health services.RESULTS: We identified 635 SC users and 635 age- and sex-matched SC non-users. SC users were significantly more likely to be homeless (χ2=138.0; p<0.0001) and to use cannabis (χ2=257.3; p<0.0001) than SC non-users. SC users had significantly more inpatient days after their first recorded use of SCs than controls (M (SD)=85.5 (199.7) vs. 25.4 (92.32); p<0.0001). Post hoc tests revealed that SC non-users who used cannabis had fewer inpatient days than SC users (p<0.0001), and that non-users of both SC and cannabis had fewer inpatient days than SC non-using cannabis users (p=0.02).CONCLUSIONS: SC use may lead to an increase in the number of days spent in hospital in patients with psychiatric illness.

Participants with schizophrenia (n = 510) were identified in an epidemiological investigation of 123 572 people aged 15 years and older in 1994 and followed up in 2008 in Xinjin, Chengdu, China. Longer DUP (>6 months) was common in participants (27.3%). In 1994, participants with DUP ≤ 6 months were more likely to have a significantly lower rate of suicide attempts, shorter duration of illness and higher rate of full remission compared with those with DUP > 6 months. No significant differences were found regarding the rates of survival, suicide, death due to other causes and homelessness between individuals with shorter and longer DUP in 2008. Nevertheless, longer DUP (>6 months) of participants in 2008 was significantly associated with higher mean of PANSS total negative and general mental scores, longer duration of illness and higher rate of live alone in the logistic regression model. Earlier identification, treatment and rehabilitation, and family intervention should be addressed when developing mental health policies and delivering community mental health services.",2018,,Psychiatry Res,267,,340-345,,10.1016/j.psychres.2018.06.043,,#3424,Ran 2018,,
Induced abortion among women veterans: data from the ECUUN study,"Schwarz, Eleanor Bimla; Sileanu, Florentina E.; Zhao, Xinhua; Mor, Maria K.; Callegari, Lisa S.; Borrero, Sonya","OBJECTIVE: We compared rates of induced abortion among women veterans receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare to rates in the general US population, as current policy prohibits VA provision of abortion counseling or services even when pregnancy endangers a veteran's life.METHODS: We analyzed data from 2298 women veterans younger than 45 years who completed a telephone-based, cross-sectional survey of randomly sampled English-speaking women from across the United States who had received VA healthcare. We compared lifetime, last-5-year and last-year rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion among participants to age-matched data from the National Survey of Family Growth. As few abortions were reported in the last year, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between abortion in the last 5 years and age, race/ethnicity, income, education, religion, marital status, parity, geography, deployment history, housing instability, and past medical and mental health among VA patients.RESULTS: Women veterans were more likely than matched US women to report ever having an abortion [17.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.1%-19.3% vs. 15.2% of US women]. In the last 5 years, unintended pregnancy and abortion were reported by veterans at rates similar to US women. In multivariable models, VA patients were more likely to report abortion in the last 5 years if their annual income was less than $40,000 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.30-6.70), they had experienced homelessness or housing instability (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.01-3.62), they were single (adj. OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.23-4.91) and/or they had given birth (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.19-4.40).CONCLUSION: Women veterans face unintended pregnancy and seek abortion as often as the larger US population.IMPLICATIONS: The Veterans Health Care Act, which prohibits provision of abortion services, increases vulnerable veterans' out-of-pocket healthcare costs and limits veterans' reproductive freedom.",2018,,Contraception,97,1,41-47,,10.1016/j.contraception.2017.09.012,,#3427,Schwarz 2018,,
"Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics Associated With Recent Incarceration Among People With HIV, United States, 2015-2017","Reyes, Jovanni V.; Myles, Ranell L.; Luo, Qingwei; Beer, Linda; Burton, Deron C.","OBJECTIVES: We examined sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors associated with previous incarceration among people with diagnosed HIV to inform HIV care efforts for this population.METHODS: We used 2015-2017 data from a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of US adults with diagnosed HIV (N = 11 739). We computed weighted percentages and 95% CIs to compare the characteristics of people with HIV incarcerated in the past 12 months (ie, recently) with people with HIV not recently incarcerated. We used adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with predicted marginal means to examine associations between selected factors and incarceration status.RESULTS: Adults with HIV who were recently incarcerated, when compared with those who were not, were more likely to be aged 18-29 years (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.51), non-Hispanic Black (PR = 1.39), less educated (<high school diploma; PR = 1.41), unemployed (PR = 1.32), or living at or below the federal poverty level (PR = 1.64); to have recently experienced homelessness (PR = 4.56); and to have recently used drugs (PR = 1.68). Clinically, they were more likely to have been diagnosed with HIV in the past 5 years (aPR = 1.26), have lower CD4 counts (aPR = 1.45), have recently used the emergency department (aPR = 1.15), and have experienced severe anxiety (aPR = 1.50) and less likely to be retained in care, be recently virally suppressed, or have sustained viral suppression.CONCLUSIONS: Among people with HIV, recent incarceration was associated with increased health risks and worse health outcomes.

First, a greater number of minutes spent rocking was associated with significantly greater scores on the Expectancy scale of the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ; p = .05), suggesting participants experiencing higher urges and desires to drink rocked to self-soothe. Second, a significant association was observed between a greater number of minutes spent rocking and lower scores on the ACQ Purposefulness subscale ( p = .03), indicating greater time rocking was associated with fewer urges and desires that are connected with the intent and plan to drink.CONCLUSION: Vestibular stimulation by rocking in a rocking chair may increase the ability to self-regulate mood and substance cravings, thereby potentially reducing risk of relapse and recurrent chronic homelessness.",2018,,J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc,24,3,190-198,,10.1177/1078390317746726,,#3434,Cross 2018,,
"The relationship between having a regular general practitioner (GP) and the experience of healthcare barriers: a cross-sectional study among young people in NSW, Australia, with oversampling from marginalised groups","Kang, Melissa; Robards, Fiona; Luscombe, Georgina; Sanci, Lena; Usherwood, Tim","BACKGROUND: Young people (12-24 years) visit general practice but may not have a 'regular' general practitioner (GP). Whether continuity of GP care influences experiences with, and barriers to, health care among young people is unknown. This paper explores the association between having a regular GP and experience of healthcare barriers and attitudes to health system navigation among young people in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional survey administered either online or face-to-face in community settings. Young people living in NSW were recruited, with oversampling of those from five socio-culturally marginalised groups (those who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, homeless, of refugee background, in rural or remote locations, sexuality and/or gender diverse). In this analysis of a larger dataset, we examined associations between having a regular GP, demographic and health status variables, barriers to health care and attitudes to health system navigation, using chi-square tests and odds ratios. Content and thematic analyses were applied to free-text responses to explore young people's views about having a regular GP.RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and sixteen young people completed the survey between 2016 and 2017. Of these, 81.1% had seen a GP in the previous 6 months and 57.8% had a regular GP. Cost was the most frequently cited barrier (45.8%) to accessing health care generally. Those with a regular GP were less likely to cite cost and other structural barriers, feeling judged, and not knowing which service to go to. Having a regular GP was associated with having more positive attitudes to health system navigation. Free-text responses provided qualitative insights, including the importance of building a relationship with one GP.CONCLUSIONS: General practice is the appropriate setting for preventive health care and care coordination. Having a regular GP is associated with fewer barriers and more positive attitudes to health system navigation and may provide better engagement with and coordination of care. Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of young people who have a regular GP.",2020,,BMC Fam Pract,21,1,220,,10.1186/s12875-020-01294-8,,#3437,Kang 2020,,
"Viral Rebound Among Persons With Diagnosed HIV Who Achieved Viral Suppression, United States","Craw, Jason A.; Beer, Linda; Tie, Yunfeng; Jaenicke, Tom; Shouse, R. Luke; Prejean, Joseph","BACKGROUND: Some persons who achieve viral suppression may later experience viral rebound, potentially putting them at risk for transmitting HIV. We estimate the prevalence of, and describe factors associated with, viral rebound among adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States who had ≥2 viral load tests in a 12-month period.SETTING: The Medical Monitoring Project is an annual cross-sectional survey about the experiences and needs of adults with diagnosed HIV sampled from the National HIV Surveillance System.METHODS: We analyzed interview and medical record data from 3 Medical Monitoring Project cycles spanning June 2015-May 2018. We analyzed viral load results from the 12-month period before the interview among persons with ≥2 viral load tests who achieved viral suppression. Data were weighted based on known probabilities of selection, adjusted for patient nonresponse, and poststratified to known population totals from the National HIV Surveillance System.RESULTS: Among those with ≥2 viral load tests who achieved viral suppression, 7.5% demonstrated viral rebound. In multivariable analyses, viral rebound was higher among non-Hispanic blacks, persons ages 18-39, persons with public insurance, persons recently experiencing homelessness, persons with higher numbers of viral load tests, persons who missed HIV care appointments, and persons with suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Viral rebound varied by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

Willingness to share contacts in case of COVID-19 positivity-predictors of collaboration resistance in a nation-wide Italian survey,"Bikbov, Boris; Tettamanti, Mauro; Bikbov, Alexander; D'Avanzo, Barbara; Galbussera, Alessia Antonella; Nobili, Alessandro; Calamandrei, Gemma; Candini, Valentina; Starace, Fabrizio; Zarbo, Cristina; de Girolamo, Giovanni","BACKGROUND: The unwillingness to share contacts is one of the least explored aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report the factors associated with resistance to collaborate on contact tracing, based on the results of a nation-wide survey conducted in Italy in January-March 2021.METHODS AND FINDINGS: The repeated cross-sectional on-line survey was conducted among 7,513 respondents (mean age 45.7, 50.4% women) selected to represent the Italian adult population 18-70 years old. Two groups were defined based on the direct question response expressing (1) unwillingness or (2) willingness to share the names of individuals with whom respondents had contact. We selected 70% of participants (training data set) to produce several multivariable binomial generalized linear models and estimated the proportion of variation explained by the model by McFadden R2, and the model's discriminatory ability by the index of concordance. Then, we have validated the regression models using the remaining 30% of respondents (testing data set), and identified the best performing model by removing the variables based on their impact on the Akaike information criterion and then evaluating the model predictive accuracy. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using principal component analysis. Overall, 5.5% of the respondents indicated that in case of positive SARS-CoV-2 test they would not share contacts. Of note, this percentage varied from 0.8% to 46.5% depending on the answers to other survey questions. From the 139 questions included in the multivariable analysis, the initial model proposed 20 independent factors that were reduced to the 6 factors with only modest changes in the model performance. The 6-variables model demonstrated good performance in the training (c-index 0.85 and McFadden R2 criteria 0.25) and in the testing data set (93.3% accuracy, AUC 0.78, sensitivity 30.4% and specificity 97.4%). The most influential factors related to unwillingness to share contacts were the lack of intention to perform the test in case of contact with a COVID-19 positive individual (OR 5.60, 95% CI 4.14 to 7.58, in a fully adjusted multivariable analysis), disagreement that the government should be allowed to force people into self-isolation (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.84), disagreement with the national vaccination schedule (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.69), not following to the preventive anti-COVID measures (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.59), the absence of people in the immediate social environment who have been infected with COVID-19 (1.66, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.21), as well as difficulties in finding or understanding the information about the infection or related recommendations. A limitation of this study is the under-representation of persons not participating in internet-based surveys and some vulnerable groups like homeless people, persons with disabilities or migrants.CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed several groups that expressed unwillingness to collaborate on contact tracing. The identified patterns may play a principal role not only in the COVID-19 epidemic but also be important for possible future public health threats, and appropriate interventions for their correction should be developed and ready for the implementation.",2022,,PLoS One,17,9,e0274902,,10.1371/journal.pone.0274902,,#3443,Bikbov 2022,,

The basic income for care leavers in Wales pilot evaluation: Protocol of a quasi-experimental evaluation,"Westlake, David; Holland, Sally; Sanders, Michael; Schroeder, Elizabeth; Pickett, Kate E.; Johnson, Matthew; Petrou, Stavros; Hick, Rod; Roberts, Louise; Rodriguez-Guzman, Guillermo; Vallis, Dimitris; Fahr, Patrick; Bezeczky, Zoe; Mathur, Vibhor; Lloyd, Harriet","BACKGROUND: This study will evaluate the Basic Income for Care Leavers in Wales pilot (BIP), which is the most generous basic income scheme in the world. A cohort of care-experienced young people who become aged 18 during a 12-month enrolment period (July 2022-June 2023) are receiving £1,600 (before tax) per month for two years, and the Welsh Government intends this to have a range of benefits. This evaluation will examine the impact of BIP, the implementation of the pilot and how it is experienced, and its value for money.METHODS: The study is a theory-based quasi-experimental evaluation, and the design and methods are informed by ongoing co-production with care-experienced young people. We will estimate the impact of BIP on participants using self-reported survey data and routinely collected administrative data. This will include outcomes across a range of domains, including psychological wellbeing, physical and mental health, financial impact, education, training and volunteering. Comparisons between temporal (Welsh) and geographical (English, using administrative data) controls will be done using coarsened exact matching and difference in differences analysis. The process evaluation will examine how BIP is implemented and experienced, primarily through monitoring data (quantitative) and interview, observational, and focus group data (qualitative). The economic evaluation will take a public sector and a societal perspective to identify, measure and value the costs and outcomes of BIP, and to synthesise the evidence to inform a social cost-benefit analysis at 24 months post-intervention.DISCUSSION: BIP is unusual in that it targets a wide range of outcomes and is available to an entire national cohort of participants. The evaluation also has several practical constraints. Therefore, the study will use a range of methods and triangulate between different analyses to assess how successful it is. Findings will inform policy in relation to care leavers, social security and basic income studies worldwide.",2024,,PLoS One,19,10,e0303837,,10.1371/journal.pone.0303837,,#3449,Westlake 2024,,
Food insecurity and food pantry use among transgender and gender non-conforming people in the Southeast United States,"Russomanno, Jennifer; Jabson Tree, Jennifer M.","BACKGROUND: Transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) people face high rates of poverty, joblessness, and homelessness, rendering this population vulnerable to experiencing food insecurity. Yet, there is almost no empirical evidence concerning food insecurity and the use of local and federal food assistance resources in the TGNC community. Food insecurity, the use of local and Federal food assistance resources, and associations with gender-related minority stressors and resilience using the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience (GMSR) scale among TGNC individuals living in the Southeast United States (U.S.) were documented in this study.METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with TGNC people living in the Southeast U.S. Participants were recruited via targeted Facebook advertisements.RESULTS: In total, 105 TGNC people completed the survey; 79% of survey participants experienced food insecurity, 19% utilized Federal, and 22% utilized local food assistance resources. High levels of minority stress and community resilience were reported. The GMSR resilience scale Pride (aOR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.19, p = .04) was significantly associated with the use of local food pantries, but minority stressors were not. No significant associations were found between GMSR and food security.CONCLUSION: TGNC people living in the Southeast U.S. experienced food insecurity, unstable housing, low wages, and social stigma that were a barrier to using emergency food resources. Multi-level public health solutions that address discriminatory legislative policies and create linkages between TGNC people and local and federal food assistance are required to address issues of food insecurity in the TGNC population.",2020,,BMC Public Health,20,1,590,,10.1186/s12889-020-08684-8,,#3452,Russomanno 2020,,

"Trends in Pediatric Viral Symptoms, Influenza Testing, and SARS-CoV-2 Testing From a Statewide Electronic Health Record Consortium, January 2017 to July 2021","Khazanchi, Rohan; Spaulding, Alicen B.; Bodurtha, Peter J.; Neely, Claire; Winkelman, Tyler N. A.; Minnesota EHR Consortium","OBJECTIVE: The heterogeneous implementation and uptake of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic amplified the need for locally responsive disease surveillance mechanisms. Using data from a newly developed statewide electronic health record (EHR) consortium in Minnesota, we sought to characterize trends in pediatric viral symptoms, influenza testing, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing.METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional analysis of EHR data from 1/1/2017 to 7/30/2021 across 8 large health systems in Minnesota. We included patients ≤18 years of age with any SARS-CoV-2 test, influenza test, or documented diagnostic code which met our viral symptom definition. We plotted week-by-week trends in viral symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza testing, and test positivity, stratified between children (0-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years).RESULTS: We identified 1,079,924 patients ≤18 years of age with viral symptoms or testing; 880,669 (81.5%) were children ≤11 years. Influenza testing and influenza test positivity remained well below historical averages from March 2020 through mid-May 2021. Peaks in viral symptoms during this time were concomitant with peaks in SARS-CoV-2 testing and test positivity, whereas influenza testing and test positivity remained stagnant. Influenza test positivity rates increased substantively among children from May through July 2021.CONCLUSIONS: Viral illness and influenza testing among pediatric patients were below historical averages throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing increases in influenza test positivity may merit clinical and public health awareness and intervention. Future NPI policies can be better targeted with insights from collaborative EHR-based surveillance, which enhances real-time, locally sensitive measurement of disease outbreaks.",2021,,Acad Pediatr,21,8,1420-1425,,10.1016/j.acap.2021.08.008,,#3456,Khazanchi 2021,,
"Tuberculosis Transmission or Mortality Among Persons Living with HIV, USA, 2011-2016","Schmit, K. M.; Shah, N.; Kammerer, S.; Bamrah Morris, S.; Marks, S. M.","BACKGROUND: Persons living with HIV are more likely to have tuberculosis (TB) disease attributed to recent transmission (RT) and to die during TB treatment than persons without HIV. We examined factors associated with RT or mortality among TB/HIV patients.METHODS: Using National TB Surveillance System data from 2011 to 2016, we calculated multivariable adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 99% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate associations between patient characteristics and RT or mortality. Mortality analyses were restricted to 2011-2014 to allow sufficient time for reporting outcomes.RESULTS: TB disease was attributed to RT in 491 (20%) of 2415 TB/HIV patients. RT was more likely among those reporting homelessness (aOR, 2.6; CI, 2.0, 3.5) or substance use (aOR,1.6; CI, 1.2, 2.1) and among blacks (aOR,1.8; CI, 1.2, 2.8) and Hispanics (aOR, 1.8; CI, 1.1, 2.9); RT was less likely among non-US-born persons (aOR, 0.2; CI, 0.2, 0.3). The proportion who died during TB treatment was higher among persons with HIV than without (8.6% versus 5.2%; p < 0.0001). Among 2273 TB/HIV patients, 195 died during TB treatment. Age ≥ 65 years (aOR, 5.3; CI, 2.4, 11.6), 45-64 years (aOR, 2.2; CI, 1.4, 3.4), and having another medical risk factor for TB (aOR, 3.3; CI, 1.8, 6.2) were associated with death; directly observed treatment (DOT) for TB was protective (aOR, 0.5; CI, 0.2, 1.0).CONCLUSIONS: Among TB/HIV patients, blacks, Hispanics, and those reporting homelessness or substance use should be prioritized for interventions that decrease TB transmission. Improved adherence to treatment through DOT was associated with decreased mortality, but additional interventions are needed to reduce mortality among older patients and those TB/HIV patients with another medical risk factor for TB.",2020,,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,7,5,865-873,,10.1007/s40615-020-00709-7,,#3459,Schmit 2020,,
Factors associated with pregnancy and induced abortion among street-involved female adolescents in two Nigerian urban cities: a mixed-method study,"Obiyan, Mary O.; Olaleye, Atinuke O.; Oyinlola, Funmilola F.; Folayan, Morenike O.","OBJECTIVES: This study determined the correlates of unwanted pregnancy and induced abortion among sexually active female street-involved adolescents (SIAs) aged 10-19 years in two urban cities in South-west, Nigeria.METHODS: The data for this study were extracted from a larger mixed-method survey dataset on the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of 1505 street-involved young people aged 10 to 24 years. For the quantitative data, the explanatory variables were age, history of school attendance, employment status, religion, living arrangement and city of residence. The study outcomes were a history of pregnancy and a history of induced abortion of last pregnancy. Binomial regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the explanatory and outcome variables. For the qualitative data generated through focus group discussions and in-depth-interviews, inductive and deductive approaches were used in conducting a thematic analysis to explore the perspectives and experiences of SIA on pregnancy and induced abortion.RESULTS: Of the 424 female SIAs, 270 (63.7%) reported having had sex. Sixty-four (23.7%) respondents had a history of pregnancy, of which 38 (59.4%) gave a history of induced abortion of the last pregnancy. A history of school attendance significantly reduced the likelihood of being pregnant (AOR: 0.42, 95% C.I: 0.19-0.91), while 15-19-years-old SIAs who were pregnant were significantly less likely to abort (AOR: 0.13, 95% C.I: 0.02-0.77). Qualitative reports indicated that unintended pregnancy and induced abortion was a common experience among the sexually active SIAs. Many participants were aware of the methods of, and places to induce abortion.CONCLUSION: A large proportion of SIAs are sexually active with a high incidence of unintended pregnancy and a high rate of unsafe abortion. Access of female SIAs to education can reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. Attention needs to be paid to how SIAs can have access to contraception.",2023,,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,25,,10.1186/s12913-022-09014-x,,#3462,Obiyan 2023,,
Sexually transmitted disease among street dwellers in southern Ethiopia: a mixed methods study design,"Wakgari, Negash; Woyo, Terefe; Kebede, Emnet; Gemeda, Hirut; Gebremedhin, Samson","BACKGROUND: Lack of knowledge about sexual violence, its consequences, substance use and homelessness are major problems that make street dwellers susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases. Hence, this study assessed knowledge, attitudes and treatment-seeking behaviors related to sexually transmitted diseases among street dwellers in southern Ethiopia.METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was conducted among 842 respondents. A simple random sampling technique was used to select seven cities among fourteen major cities of the region. The sample was allocated proportionally to each selected city. In order to identify and fill in the required sample size, a snowball sampling technique was used. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. The collected data were entered using Epidata and exported to SPSS version 23.0 for further analysis. Unstructured questionnaires were also used to collect 21 in-depth interviews and 10 key informants' interviews. Respondents for in-depth interviews were selected purposively during quantitative data collection.RESULTS: Most street dwellers were aware of (86.7%) and had a favourable attitude towards (84.4%) prevention and management of sexually transmitted diseases. A portion of respondents experienced bad-smelling genital discharge (13.8%), genital ulcers (11.2%) and a burning sensation (14.5%) during urination, in the previous year. Among those who experienced symptoms of sexually transmitted disease, only 15.3% of them received treatment from a health care provider. Fear of questions raised by providers was one of the reasons for not seeking care according to our qualitative findings.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a significant number of street dwellers reported experiencing symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease. Despite having awareness about sexually transmitted diseases, seeking treatment from a health center was found to be low based on both quantitative and qualitative findings. We recommend that health care providers should undergo special training to address the sexual and reproductive health problems of street dwellers.",2020,,BMC Public Health,20,1,434,,10.1186/s12889-020-08584-x,,#3465,Wakgari 2020,,
Double-blind evaluation of homeopathy on cocaine craving: a randomized controlled pilot study,"Adler, Ubiratan Cardinalli; Acorinte, Ana Carolina; Calzavara, Fernando Oliveira; da Silva, Adriano André; de Toledo Cesar, Amarilys; Adler, Maristela Schiabel; Martinez, Edson Zangiacomi; Galduróz, José Carlos Fernandes","BACKGROUND: Brazil is among the nations with the greatest rates of annual cocaine usage. Pharmacological treatment of cocaine addiction is still limited, opening space for nonconventional interventions. Homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and Erythroxylum coca have been tested in the integrative treatment of cocaine craving among homeless addicts, but this setting had not proven feasible, due to insufficient recruitment.OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effectiveness and tolerability of homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca in the integrative treatment of cocaine craving in a community-based psychosocial rehabilitation setting.DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, eight-week pilot trial was performed at the Psychosocial Attention Center for Alcohol and Other Drugs (CAPS-AD), Sao Carlos/SP, Brazil. Eligible subjects included CAPS-AD patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis of cocaine dependence (F14.2). The patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: psychosocial rehabilitation plus homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca (homeopathy group), and psychosocial rehabilitation plus indistinguishable placebo (placebo group).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was the percentage of cocaine-using days. Secondary measures were the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores. Adverse events were reported in both groups.RESULTS: The study population comprised 54 patients who attended at least one post-baseline assessment, out of the 104 subjects initially enrolled. The mean percentage of cocaine-using days in the homeopathy group was 18.1% (standard deviation (SD): 22.3%), compared to 29.8% (SD: 30.6%) in the placebo group (P < 0.01). Analysis of the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale scores showed no between-group differences in the intensity of cravings, but results significantly favored homeopathy over placebo in the proportion of weeks without craving episodes and the patients' appraisal of treatment efficacy for reduction of cravings. Analysis of 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores found no significant differences. Few adverse events were reported: 0.57 adverse events/patient in the homeopathy group compared to 0.69 adverse events/patient in the placebo group (P = 0.41).CONCLUSIONS: A psychosocial rehabilitation setting improved recruitment but was not sufficient to decrease dropout frequency among Brazilian cocaine treatment seekers. Psychosocial rehabilitation plus homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca were more effective than psychosocial rehabilitation alone in reducing cocaine cravings. Due to high dropout rate and risk of bias, further research is required to confirm our findings, with specific focus on strategies to increase patient retention.TRIAL REGISTRATION: RBR-2xzcwz (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br).",2018,,J Integr Med,16,3,178-184,,10.1016/j.joim.2018.03.004,,#3468,Adler 2018,,
Health Care Access and Use Among U.S. Children Exposed to Neighborhood Violence,"Khazanchi, Rohan; South, Eugenia C.; Cabrera, Keven I.; Winkelman, Tyler N. A.; Vasan, Aditi","INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood violence is an adverse childhood experience which impacts millions of U.S. children and is associated with poor health outcomes across the life course. These effects may be mitigated by access to care. Yet, the ways in which exposure to neighborhood violence shapes children's health care access have been understudied.METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 16,083 children (weighted N=67,214,201) ages 1 to <18 years from the 2019 and 2021 National Health Interview Survey. Guardians were asked about preventive care access, unmet health needs, and health care utilization in the last year. Changes associated with exposure to neighborhood violence were estimated using marginal effects from multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for year, age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, family structure, rurality, income, insurance type, insurance discontinuity, and overall reported health.RESULTS: Of 16,083 sample children, 863 (weighted 5.3% [95% CI 4.8-5.7]) reported exposure to neighborhood violence, representing a weighted population of ∼3.5 million. In adjusted analyses, exposure to violence was associated with forgone prescriptions (adjusted difference 1.2 percentage-points (pp) [95%CI 0.1-2.3]; weighted national population impact 42,833 children), trouble paying medical bills (7.7pp [4.4-11.0]; 271,735), delayed medical (1.5pp [0.2-2.9]; 54,063) and mental health care (2.8pp [1.1-4.6]; 98,627), and increased urgent care (4.5pp [0.9-8.1]; 158,246) and emergency department utilization (6.4pp [3.1-9.8]; 227,373).CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative study, neighborhood violence exposure among children was associated with unmet health needs and increased acute care utilization. Evidence-based interventions to improve access to care and reduce economic precarity in communities impacted by violence are needed to mitigate downstream physical and mental health consequences.",2024,,Am J Prev Med,66,6,936-947,,10.1016/j.amepre.2024.01.009,,#3471,Khazanchi 2024,,
Prospective Assessment of Social Determinants of Health and Length of Stay Among Emergency General Surgery and Trauma Patients,"DePolo, Nicole; Bathan, Karen; Tran, Zachary; Peng, Jiahao; Singh, Pramil; Lum, Sharon S.; Wu, Esther","BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDOH) including insurance and substance use affect 50-90% of health outcomes, yet there remains no standard means to quantify or predict their impact. We prospectively evaluated the effects of SDOH on length of stay (LOS) and readmissions among emergency general surgery (EGS) and trauma patients. We compared these outcomes with Medicare Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) data to better quantify the impact of SDOH.METHODS: Adult (≥18 years old) EGS/trauma patients admitted July 7-28, 2020 at a Level 1 trauma center were prospectively enrolled. Primary outcomes were overall LOS, one-year readmissions, and excess LOS (eLOS), defined as days beyond DRG mean LOS.RESULTS: Assessment of SDOH among the 52 patients enrolled revealed that 5.8% of patients were homeless; 26.9% experienced substance abuse; 13.5% were uninsured on admission; and 7.7% on discharge. Mean LOS was 5 ± 4 days; 1-year readmission rate 25.0%; eLOS mean 1.75 ± 2.4 days. LOS was associated with substance use (OR 70.6 95% CI 11.7-160.4). eLOS was associated with substance use (OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.5-25.1) and public or no insurance (OR 26.0, 95% CI 4.9-138.1). No correlations were found between SDOH and readmission rates.DISCUSSION: EGS and trauma patients experience high rates of negative SDOH which affect clinical outcomes including LOS and readmissions. Medicare DRG determined eLOS is a fiscally relevant measure of the impact of SDOH and differs from LOS and readmissions. Further investigation is required to determine if eLOS can delineate the effects of other SDOH on admission outcomes for this patient population.",2023,,Am Surg,89,10,4186-4190,,10.1177/00031348231180927,,#3474,DePolo 2023,,
Trajectories of Psychological Distress in Australians Living in Urban Poverty: The Impact of Interpersonal Trauma,"Keane, Carol A.; Magee, Christopher A.; Kelly, Peter J.","Childhood maltreatment and interpersonal trauma experience is an important factor underpinning the apparent perpetuation of the cycle of social disadvantage experienced by homeless adults. This paper aimed to examine longitudinal patterns of psychological distress in a sample of 1,504 socially disadvantaged adult participants from the Journeys Home Study in Australia. The current paper utilized the ""conservation of resources"" theory and the concept of ""risk factor caravans"" to investigate the nature and implications of childhood trauma in the context of homelessness. Growth mixture modeling revealed four distinct trajectories of psychological distress as measured by the Kessler 6 across six time points (covering a period of 2.5 years): chronic, escalating, attenuating, and resistant. Our results also indicated that experiences of different types of trauma during childhood were associated with these psychological distress trajectories. In particular, adults experiencing chronic psychological distress were significantly more likely than those exhibiting distress resistance to have experienced multiple and varied childhood maltreatment, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.30, 95% CI [0.37, 6.05], p = .002. Furthermore, adult experiences of assault were found to be associated with psychological distress. These findings have important implications for mental health, as well as interventions aimed at breaking the cycle of urban poverty. Specific focus on interpersonal trauma vulnerabilities is important. Prioritizing socioecological stability, with mental health needs assessed on an individual level, may be most appropriate. This work also highlights the need to direct future attention to barriers to access and facilitation of social support services.",2018,,J Trauma Stress,31,3,362-372,,10.1002/jts.22297,,#3477,Keane 2018,,
College focused rapid rehousing: Deploying an existing community model to address homelessness on campus,"Baiocchi, Arturo; Curry, Susanna; Crutchfield, Rashida; Wolin, Jessica; Wilking, Jennifer; Roll, Susan","Research indicates that financial and housing insecurity challenges are widespread on most college campuses throughout the U.S. However, there is wide variability in how campuses address these challenges. This study reports on a three-year implementation of the College-Focused Rapid Rehousing pilot; an initiative in California by which universities commissioned community providers to assist students in need via a modified Rapid Rehousing (RRH) intervention. RRH is a widely implemented intervention that combines move-in assistance, short-term rental subsidies, and ongoing case management, to help individuals quickly transition into stable housing. The mixed-methods evaluation included analyses of online surveys (n = 141), administrative records (n = 368), and focus groups conducted with staff across eight campuses (n = 35). Survey findings indicate that CFRR programs assisted a diverse group of students with similar histories of housing insecurity. Quantitative analyses also show that most participants experienced the intervention as designed, though with some inconsistencies in how quickly some were assisted. Qualitative findings highlight contextual factors that affected the consistency of the intervention, including tight rental markets and philosophical disagreements among administrators about the intervention's scope. Despite study limitations, findings provide insights into the applicability of the RRH model on campus settings and directions for future research.",2024,,J Prev Interv Community,52,1,122-142,,10.1080/10852352.2024.2315369,,#3480,Baiocchi 2024,,
"Impact of Targeted Local Interventions on Tuberculosis Awareness and Screening Among Persons Experiencing Homelessness During a Large Tuberculosis Outbreak in Atlanta, Georgia, 2015-2016","Kerr, Eleanor M.; Vonnahme, Laura A.; Goswami, Neela D.","OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks disproportionately affect persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) in the United States. During 2014-2016, a resurgent TB outbreak occurred among PEH in Atlanta, Georgia. To control the outbreak, citywide policies and educational interventions were implemented in January 2015. Policy changes standardized and enforced TB screening requirements for PEH in homeless shelters. Educational campaigns informed PEH of the outbreak and encouraged TB screening. We evaluated factors associated with, and the effect policy changes and educational interventions had on, TB screening and awareness among PEH in Atlanta.METHODS: Questions related to TB screening and awareness of the outbreak were added to an annual US Department of Housing and Urban Development survey of PEH in Atlanta in 2015 (n = 296 respondents) and 2016 (n = 1325 respondents). We analyzed the 2016 survey data to determine characteristics associated with outcomes.RESULTS: From 2015 to 2016, reported TB screening increased from 81% to 86%, and awareness of the TB outbreak increased from 68% to 75%. In 2016, sheltered PEH were significantly more likely than unsheltered PEH to report being evaluated for TB in the previous 6 months (prevalence odds ratio [pOR] = 3.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.28-4.47) and to report being aware of the TB outbreak (pOR = 4.00; 95% CI, 2.89-5.55).CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of required TB screening and educational interventions may reduce the incidence and severity of TB outbreaks among PEH in other communities. Furthermore, the annual survey of PEH offers an opportunity to collect data to better inform practices and policies.",2020,,Public Health Rep,135,1_suppl,90S-99S,,10.1177/0033354920932644,,#3483,Kerr 2020,,
Intimate partner violence and receptive syringe sharing among women who inject drugs in Indonesia: A respondent-driven sampling study,"Stoicescu, Claudia; Cluver, Lucie D.; Spreckelsen, Thees F.; Mahanani, Mietta M.; Ameilia, Rima","BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV are overlapping public health problems that disproportionately affect women who inject drugs. Little is known about the relationship between IPV and HIV-related unsafe injecting practices among women in low- and middle-income settings. This study investigated whether IPV victimisation was associated with receptive syringe sharing among women who inject drugs in Indonesia.METHODS: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used to recruit 731 women aged 18+ years, injecting drugs in the preceding 12 months, and residing in Greater Jakarta or Bandung, West Java. Population estimates were derived using the RDS-II estimator. Multivariate logistic regressions assessed relationships between different forms of past-year IPV (i.e. psychological abuse, physical and/or injurious assault, forced sex) and receptive syringe sharing, controlling for city differences and sociodemographic cofactors.RESULTS: Overall, 21.1% of participants reported engaging in past-month receptive syringe sharing. In multivariate analyses controlling for all forms of IPV, receptive syringe sharing was significantly positively associated with experiencing psychological abuse (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.06,3.24; p = 0.030), physical and/or injurious assault (OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.04,2.89; p = 0.034), and several covariates: injecting pharmaceuticals only (versus heroin only) (OR = 3.58; 95% CI = 1.66,7.69; p = 0.001), experiencing unstable housing and/or homelessness (OR = 2.89; 95% CI = 1.41,5.95; p = 0.004), and residing in Bandung, West Java (versus Greater Jakarta) (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.40,3.90; p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: IPV is a significant risk factor for HIV-related injecting risk among women who inject drugs in Indonesia. These findings indicate the urgent need to scale up harm reduction interventions and align existing programs with IPV prevention and support services, with specific efforts targeting the needs of female injectors.",2019,,Int J Drug Policy,63,,11-Jan,,10.1016/j.drugpo.2018.08.009,,#3486,Stoicescu 2019,,
"Psychosocial Determinants of HIV Stigma among Men Who Have Sex with Men in San Francisco, California","Bhatta, Dharma N.; Hecht, Jennifer; Facente, Shelley N.","BACKGROUND: Stigma and discrimination are major challenges faced by people living with HIV (PLWH), and stigma continues to be prevalent among PLWH. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 584 men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV between July 2018 and December 2020, designed to better understand which demographic and behavioral characteristics of MSM living with HIV in San Francisco, California are associated with experience of stigma, so that programs and initiatives can be tailored appropriately to minimize HIV stigma's impacts.METHODS: This analysis was conducted with data from San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF) encompassing services from multiple different locations in San Francisco. Data about the level of HIV-related stigma experienced were collected through a single question incorporated into programmatic data collection forms at SFAF as part of the client record stored in SFAF's electronic health record. We performed linear regression to determine the associations between self-reported experiences of HIV stigma and other characteristics among MSM living with HIV.RESULTS: HIV stigma was low overall among MSM living with HIV who are actively engaged in HIV care in San Francisco; however, it was significantly higher for the age groups of 13-29 years (adjusted risk difference (ARD): 0.251, 95% CI: 0.012, 0.489) and 30-49 years (ARD: 0.205, 95% CI: 0.042, 0.367) when compared to the age group of 50 years and older, as well as people who were homeless (ARD: 0.844, 95% CI: 0.120, 1.568), unstably housed (ARD: 0.326, 95% CI: 0.109, 0.543) and/or having mental health concerns (ARD: 0.309, 95% CI: 0.075, 0.544), controlling for race, injection history, and viral load.CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight an opportunity to develop culturally, socially, and racially appropriate interventions to reduce HIV stigma among MSM living with HIV, particularly for younger men and those struggling with housing stability and/or mental health.",2021,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,18,15,8031,,10.3390/ijerph18158031,,#3489,Bhatta 2021,,
Correlates of Transitions Into Housing Instability Among Veterans Accessing Veterans Health Administration Health Care,"Montgomery, Ann E.; Rahman, Fazlur A. K. M.; Cusack, Meagan; Varley, Allyson; Byrne, Thomas","BACKGROUND: Prior research has explored the patterns and dynamics of homelessness; such an understanding is necessary to improve policy and programmatic responses and prevent new episodes of housing instability.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to identify correlates of veterans' transitions into housing instability and inform initiatives aimed to address their needs, with a focus on how to prevent new episodes of housing instability.METHODS: The cohort for this study includes 4,633,069 veterans who responded to the Veterans Health Administration's universal screen for housing instability at least twice between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2016; 1.2% reported recent housing instability and 98.8% reported ongoing housing stability. The χ or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate, compared veterans' characteristics by housing status. A multivariate logistic regression identified independent risk factors associated with recent housing instability, controlling for sociodemographic, military service, diagnostic, and health services use variables.RESULTS: Sociodemographic and health services use variables increased veterans' odds of transitioning into housing instability. The diagnoses with the greatest effect sizes were drug use disorder (adjusted odds ratio=1.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.45-1.55) and opioid use disorder, which was associated with a >2-fold increase in the odds of experiencing recent housing instability (adjusted odds ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval: 2.04-2.41).CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence to inform existing and future interventions to prevent new episodes of housing instability.

This article describes and compares differences in the prevalence of self-reported experiences with discrimination in health care settings by sociodemographic and clinical care factors among persons with diagnosed HIV in the United States.METHODS: We analyzed interview and medical record data collected during June 2018-May 2019 from 3850 PWH who had received HIV care in the past 12 months. We calculated weighted percentages and associated 95% confidence intervals and assessed the association between any experience of discrimination and selected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics using prevalence ratios with predicted marginal means.RESULTS: Approximately 25% of PWH who had an HIV care visit in the past 12 months reported experiencing any discrimination. Experiences with discrimination were significantly more prevalent among persons aged 18-29 years (34%); transgender persons (41%); persons of gay (25%), bisexual (31%), or other (40%) sexual orientations; and persons who did not have a regular provider (39%), lived at/below poverty level (28%), were homeless (39%) or incarcerated (37%) in the past 12 months. PWH who experienced discrimination were more likely to have missed at least one HIV care visit, not be taking antiretroviral therapy, and have missed antiretroviral therapy doses.

"Performance of a short, self-report adherence scale in a probability sample of persons using HIV antiretroviral therapy in the United States","Wilson, Ira B.; Tie, Yunfeng; Padilla, Mabel; Rogers, William H.; Beer, Linda","BACKGROUND: Excellent adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains a cornerstone of HIV care. A three-item adherence self-report scale was recently developed and validated, but the scale has not been previously tested in a nationally representative sample.DESIGN: We administered the adherence scale to participants in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Medical Monitoring Project, which is a probability sample of US adults with diagnosed HIV.METHODS: We combined sociodemographic and clinical participant data from three consecutive cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project (6/2015-5/2018). We used medical record reviews to determine most recent viral load, and whether viral loads were suppressed at all measurement points in the past 12 months. We describe the relationship between adherence scale score and two measures of viral load suppression (most recent and sustained), and estimate linear regression models using sampling weights to determine independent predictors of ART adherence scores.RESULTS: Of those using ART, the median adherence score was 93 (100 = perfect adherence), and the standardized Cronbach's alpha was 0.83. For both measures of viral load suppression, the relationship with the adherence score was generally linear; there was no 'cutoff' point indicating good vs. poor adherence. In the multivariable model, younger age, nonwhite race, poverty, homelessness, depression, binge-drinking, and both non-IDU and IDU were independently associated with lower adherence.CONCLUSION: The adherence measure had good psychometric qualities and a linear relationship with viral load, supporting its use in both clinical care and research.

Participants met the following criteria: 1) 18 years or older, 2) current moderate/severe opioid use disorder (DSM-5), 3) past 6-month NPB use. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify subgroups based on past 6-month (days of NPB and heroin/fentanyl use; use of NPB to get high; use of non-prescribed and prescribed pharmaceutical opioids; participation in formal treatment) and lifetime (years since first NPB and other illicit opioid use) characteristics. Selected auxiliary variables were compared across classes using Asparouhov and Muthén's 3-step approach.RESULTS: 49.7% were female, and 88.8% were non-Hispanic whites. 89% used NPB to self-treat withdrawal.

I'm just trying to stay: Experiences of temporal uncertainty in modular and supportive housing among young people who use drugs in Vancouver,"Manson, Daniel; Kerr, Thomas; Fast, Danya","Over the past decades the city of Vancouver has attempted to address a lack of affordable housing for it most marginalized citizens, including young people who use drugs (YPWUD), by expanding access to temporary modular and supportive housing. These projects are guided by a Housing First philosophy that recognizes housing as a key social determinant of health. In this commentary, we draw attention to how, rather than providing a clear pathway to greater stability, modular and supportive housing have become part of broader ""institutional circuits"" that reinforce residential transience and what we call ""temporal uncertainty."" We use this term to describe a painful and frustrating inability to move though time in desired ways despite the promise of greater stability that housing is supposed to engender. Rather than allowing young people to establish more predictable day-to-day rhythms and routines and enact the futures they imagine for themselves, residing in modular and supportive housing environments often generates significant instability and uncertainty. We believe that Housing First interventions have significant potential to reduce harms and improve outcomes for YPWUD. However, chronic temporal uncertainty must be addressed, including through the creation of more permanent, desirable social housing, extending supports to young people beyond tenancies, and working with them to develop timelines and plans for what happens next.",2022,,Int J Drug Policy,110,,103893,,10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103893,,#3507,Manson 2022,,

Entry to Sex Trade and Long-Term Vulnerabilities of Female Sex Workers Who Enter the Sex Trade Before the Age of Eighteen,"Footer, Katherine H. A.; White, Rebecca Hamilton; Park, Ju Nyeong; Decker, Michele R.; Lutnick, Alexandra; Sherman, Susan G.","Female sex workers are a structurally vulnerable population, including critical insecurity such as having access to food and shelter. This risk may be heightened among individuals who enter sex work as minors. However, the reasons for entering sex work as a minor and the long-term structural risk implications are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the reasons for and long-term impact of trading sex before the age of eighteen on women's structural vulnerability among a cohort of 250 cisgender women involved in street-based sex work in Baltimore City, Maryland, USA. We used logistic regression to explore the role of age of entry on two structural vulnerability outcomes of interest (homelessness and recent food insecurity in the past 3 months). Overall, 73% of women entered the sex trade to get drugs, 36% of women entered to get basic necessities such as food or housing, and 17% of women entered to support their children or family. Of significance, 21% of those aged < 18 years at entry reported being either coerced, threatened, pressured, misled, tricked, or physically forced into trading sex compared to 5% in those who entered at an older age group (p value < 0.001). In adjusted analysis, women who first trade sex before the age of 18 had 4.54 increased odds of experiencing recent homelessness (95% CI 1.92-10.70) and had 3.14 times increased odds of experiencing recent food insecurity (95% CI 1.42-6.94). Those who entered as minors were also more likely to be HIV positive (11.3% vs 3.6%, p value = 0.02). This study highlights that those who trade sex at a younger age experience an ongoing cumulative vulnerability in comparison to those entering over the age of 18. These findings call for additional research into a more detailed understanding of young women's entry into the sex trade and trajectory.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the participant co-funded assistance program ('Return to Country' [R2C]), when offered to low socio-economic individuals experiencing homelessness, represented an effective use of scarce resources.STUDY DESIGN: In northern Australia, a remote and sparsely populated area, Indigenous persons who travel to regional centres cannot always afford airfares home; they therefore become stranded away from their 'country' leading to rapidly deteriorating health, isolation and separation from family and kin. The R2C program was designed to facilitate travel for persons who were temporarily stranded and were voluntarily seeking to return home. The program provided operational support and funding (participants co-funded AU$99) to participants to return home.METHODS: Using a descriptive, case series research design, university researchers independently evaluated the R2C program using semi-structured interviews with 37 participants.RESULTS: An investment of AU$970 per participant in the program with partial co-payment was associated with high participant acceptability and satisfaction in-line with harms reduction around substance and criminal abuse, which is suggestive of long-term success for the model.CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can contribute to the development of best practice guidelines and policies that specifically address the needs of this unique population of stranded persons, who are seeking to return home. The acceptance of the co-payment model can be adopted by policy makers involved in homelessness prevention in other locations in Australia or internationally as an add-on service provision to mainstream housing support.",2018,,Public Health,156,,26-33,,10.1016/j.puhe.2017.11.021,,#3516,Jacups 2018,,
Association of illicit drug use in adolescence with socioeconomic and criminal justice outcomes in adulthood: prospective findings from a UK national birth cohort,"White, James; Bell, Steven; Batty, G. David","BACKGROUND: Illicit drug use in adolescence has been linked to drug use and poor mental health in adult life, but few studies have examined the relation between adult economic and criminal justice outcomes.METHODS: We analysed data from 14 082 participants (6999 women) in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study. Illicit drug use over study members' lifetime and in the past year were self-reported at 16 years of age. Thirteen outcomes were self-reported at 30 years of age, including illicit drug use, smoking, problems with alcohol, mental and physical health, experience of socioeconomic disadvantage and experiences with the criminal justice system.RESULTS: At 16 years of age, 20.3% of the participants had ever tried an illicit drug and 7.2% had used in the past year. After adjustment for ﻿childhood socioeconomic status and mental health problems, and following correction for multiple testing, there was a dose-response association between illicit drug use at 16 years with illicit drug use in adult life in the past year (OR; 95% CI - 1.83, 1.51 to 3.12), experiencing homelessness (1.74, 1.16 to 2.62), being arrested (1.57, 1.29 to 1.92) and cautioned (1.97, 1.50 to 2.57) by the police, and being found guilty at court (1.73, 1.34 to 2.23).CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent drug use was associated with an array of social and criminal outcomes in later life.",2020,,J Epidemiol Community Health,74,9,705-709,,10.1136/jech-2019-213282,,#3519,White 2020,,
Patient Flow and Reutilization of Crisis Services Within 30 Days in a Comprehensive Crisis System,"Tomovic, Milos; Balfour, Margaret E.; Cho, Ted; Prathap, Nishanth; Harootunian, Gevork; Mehreen, Raihana; Ostrovsky, Andrey; Goldman, Matthew L.","OBJECTIVE: Crisis services are undergoing an unprecedented expansion in the United States, but research is lacking on crisis system design. This study describes how individuals flow through a well-established crisis system and examines factors associated with reutilization of such services.METHODS: This cross-sectional study used Medicaid claims to construct episodes describing the flow of individuals through mobile crisis, specialized crisis facility, emergency department, and inpatient services. Claims data were merged with electronic health record (EHR) data for the subset of individuals receiving care at a crisis response center. A generalized estimating equation was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for demographic, clinical, and operational factors associated with reutilization of services within 30 days of an episode's end point.RESULTS: Of 41,026 episodes, most (57.4%) began with mobile crisis services or a specialized crisis facility rather than the emergency department. Of the subset (N=9,202 episodes) with merged EHR data, most episodes (63.3%) were not followed by reutilization. Factors associated with increased odds of 30-day reutilization included Black race, homelessness, stimulant use, psychosis, and episodes beginning with mobile crisis services or ending with inpatient care. Decreased odds were associated with depression, trauma, and involuntary legal status. Most (59.3%) episodes beginning with an involuntary legal status ended with a voluntary status.CONCLUSIONS: Crisis systems can serve a large proportion of individuals experiencing psychiatric emergencies and divert them from more restrictive and costly levels of care. Understanding demographic, clinical, and operational factors associated with 30-day reutilization may aid in the design and implementation of crisis systems.",2024,,Psychiatr Serv,75,7,614-621,,10.1176/appi.ps.20230232,,#3522,Tomovic 2024,,
"Brief Report: Longitudinal Associations Between Place of Sex Work and Client Condom Coercion Among Sex Workers in Baltimore, Maryland","Logie, Carmen H.; White, Rebecca H.; Galai, Noya; Tomko, Catherine; Sherman, Susan G.","INTRODUCTION: The sex work environment influences sex workers' control over enforcing condom use. Sex work in outdoor and public spaces, compared with indoor spaces, may inhibit condom negotiation. We examined longitudinal associations between public place of sex work and condom coercion among female sex workers.METHODS: This cohort study involved 5 data collection points over 1 year among female sex workers (N = 246) in Baltimore, Maryland, recruited by targeted sampling. We conducted bivariate analyses to examine associations between currently conducting any sex work in a public place (PPSW, eg, car, abandoned house, street, park/forest, and public bathroom) vs. exclusively indoor sex work (eg, house, motel, and dance club) with sociodemographic, substance use (eg, injection drug use, crack use), and past 3-month condom coercion (eg, client condom refusal/removal). We used logistic regressions with generalized estimating equations and exchangeable correlation structure to examine longitudinal associations between PPSW and subsequent condom coercion, adjusting for sociodemographic and substance use variables.FINDINGS: Among participants (race/ethnicity: White: 67.5%; Black/African American: 22.8%; Latina/other ethnicity: n = 9.8%; age range: 18-61), most reported daily injection drug use (58.5%), daily crack use (62.2%), and homelessness (62.2%). Most (88.6%) reported any PPSW at baseline. Current PPSW was associated with increased odds of past 3-month condom coercion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 2.94, P = 0.01) compared with indoor sex work, as was daily crack use (aOR 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 2.37).CONCLUSIONS: Public sex work environments were associated with client condom coercion and confer additional sexual health risks in contexts of illegality.

Jovon; Koreitem, Ala; Mocello, A. Rain; Lisha, Nadra E.; Leslie, Hannah H.; Estrada, Itzel; Libby, Margaret K.; Lippman, Sheri A.; Lightfoot, Marguerita A.","BACKGROUND: Deep-rooted racial residential segregation and housing discrimination have given rise to housing disparities among low-income Black young adults in the US. Most studies have focused on single dimensions of housing instability, and thus provide a partial view of how Black young adults experience multiple, and perhaps overlapping, experiences of housing instability including homelessness, frequent moves, unaffordability, or evictions. We aimed to illuminate the multiple forms of housing instability that Black young adults contend with and examine relationships between housing instability and mental health outcomes.METHODS: Using baseline data from the Black Economic Equity Movement (BEEM) guaranteed income trial with 300 urban low-income Black young adults (aged 18-24), we conducted a three-stage latent class analysis using nine housing instability indicators. We identified distinct patterns by using fit indices and theory to determine the optimal number of latent classes. We then used multinomial logistic regression to identify subpopulations disproportionately represented within unstable housing patterns. Finally, we estimated associations between housing experience patterns and mental health outcomes: depression, anxiety, and hope.RESULTS: We found high prevalence of housing instability with 27.3% of participants reporting experiences of homelessness in the prior year and 39.0% of participants reporting multiple measures of housing instability. We found the 4-class solution to be the best fitting model for the data based on fit indices and theory. Latent classes were characterized as four housing experience patterns: 1) more stably housed, 2) unaffordable and overcrowded housing, 3) mainly unhoused, and 4) multiple dimensions of housing instability. Those experiencing unaffordable and overcrowded housing and being mainly unhoused were more than four times as likely to have symptoms of depression (Unaffordable: aOR = 4.57, 95% CI: 1.64, 12.72; Unhoused: aOR = 4.67, 95% CI:1.18, 18.48) and more than twice as likely to report anxiety (Unaffordable: aOR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.03, 5.04; Unhoused: aOR = 3.36, 95% CI: 1.12, 10.05) compared to the more stably housed pattern. We found that hope scores were similarly high across patterns.CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of housing instability and mental health challenges among low-income Black young adults demands tailored interventions to reduce instability, given widening racial disparities and implications for future well-being into adulthood.",2024,,BMC Public Health,24,1,2492,,10.1186/s12889-024-19948-y,,#3528,Nakphong 2024,,
"The relationship between drug use settings, roles in the drug economy, and witnessing a drug overdose in Baltimore, Maryland","Latkin, Carl A.; Edwards, Catie; Davey-Rothwell, Melissa A.; Yang, Cui; Tobin, Karin E.","BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in drug overdose deaths in the United States. In the current study, the authors examined factors associated with witnessing a drug overdose.METHODS: A sample of 450 substance users in Baltimore, Maryland, were recruited for a behavioral intervention and were administered a survey. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to compare participants who never witnessed a drug overdose with those who witnessed one in the prior 6 months and those who witnessed an overdose over 6 months ago.RESULTS: Most (58%) participants were male, 40% experienced homelessness in the prior 6 months, 63% reported a history of heroin injecting, 84% had snorted heroin, 75% reported witnessing a drug overdose, and 38% experienced an overdose. In multinomial logistic regression models, witnessing an overdose in the past 6 months was associated with number of different types of places where drugs were used (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.34), history of experiencing an overdose (aOR = 1.80), injecting heroin and/or speedball (aOR = 1.78), and snorting heroin (aOR = 1.54). Witnessing an overdose more than 6 months ago was associated with number of different places where drugs were used (aOR = 1.25), history of experiencing an overdose (aOR = 1.61), snorting heroin (aOR = 1.42), and injecting heroin or speedball (aOR = 1.47).CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that people who engage in more public and frequent drug use, and hence are more likely to witness an overdose, should be targeted for interventions to prevent and treat drug overdose.",2018,,Subst Abus,39,3,384-389,,10.1080/08897077.2018.1439801,,#3531,Latkin 2018,,
Development and Validation of a Risk Prediction Tool to Identify People with HIV Infection Likely Not to Achieve Viral Suppression,"Gebrezgi, Merhawi T.; Fennie, Kristopher P.; Sheehan, Diana M.; Ibrahimou, Boubakari; Jones, Sandra G.; Brock, Petra; Ladner, Robert A.; Trepka, Mary Jo","Identifying people with HIV infection (PHIV), who are at risk of not achieving viral suppression, is important for designing targeted intervention. The aim of this study was to develop and test a risk prediction tool for PHIV who are at risk of not achieving viral suppression after a year of being in care. We used retrospective data to develop an integer-based scoring method using backward stepwise logistic regression. We also developed risk score categories based on the quartiles of the total risk score. The risk prediction tool was internally validated by bootstrapping. We found that nonviral suppression after a year of being in care among PHIV can be predicted using seven variables, namely, age group, race, federal poverty level, current AIDS status, current homelessness status, problematic alcohol/drug use, and current viral suppression status. Those in the high-risk category had about a 23 increase in the odds of nonviral suppression compared with the low-risk group. The risk prediction tool has good discriminative performance and calibration. Our findings suggest that nonviral suppression after a year of being in care can be predicted using easily available variables. In settings with similar demographics, the risk prediction tool can assist health care providers in identifying high-risk individuals to target for intervention. Follow-up studies are required to externally validate this risk prediction tool.",2020,,AIDS Patient Care STDS,34,4,157-165,,10.1089/apc.2019.0224,,#3534,Gebrezgi 2020,,
Children on the Streets of Ibadan Nigeria: Neglect of Children's Rights,"Obimakinde, A. M.; Shabir, Moosa","BACKGROUND: The Nigerian Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 2008 enacted prohibitive laws against child streetism. However, in metropolises like Ibadan, there is a growing epidemic of street children, particularly the category with existing family ties known as ""children on the streets"". Children on the street come from home daily to engage in economic-oriented activities on the streets and return home to their families at night time.OBJECTIVE: We focused on perceptions of formal responses to the problem of child streetism in Ibadan.METHODS: This was qualitative research. Participants were selected from each of the five urban LGA of Ibadan, purposively and by snowball technique. In-depth Interviews (IDI) were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Framework analysis of data was supported by ATLASTi version 22.RESULTS: Fifty-three (53) interviews were conducted including IDI with ten (10) child-welfare officers, ten (10) street shop owners, eleven (11) children on the street, and ten (10) pairs of parent-child dyads. Two themes emerged including governmental shortcomings with six subthemes and suboptimal governmental interventions with four subthemes. Child streetism in Ibadan is a consequence of the State's failed education systems, inadequate children's vocational and rehabilitation programs, lax child welfare laws, lack of empowerment of skilled children, and poor implementation of the policy on ideal family size. Interventions that were existing but sub-optimal included communitybased child welfare programs, parental poverty alleviation, public sensitisation and child welfare monitoring programmes.CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to update, enforce laws, and amalgamate efforts against child streetism in Ibadan.",2024,,West Afr J Med,41,3,265-276,,,,#3537,Obimakinde 2024,,
An exploratory study of the prevalence and adverse associations of in-school traditional bullying and cyberbullying among adolescents in Connecticut,"Rostam-Abadi, Yasna; Stefanovics, Elina A.; Zhai, Zu Wei; Potenza, Marc N.","Bullying, traditional or cyber, among adolescents, is a public health concern. In this study, we explored frequencies and correlates of different forms of bullying among Connecticut high-school students. Youth Risk Behavior Survey data from 2019 from Connecticut adolescents (N = 1814) were used. χ2 tests and survey-weighted logistic regressions examined relationships between bullying subgroups (in-school traditional bullying (ISTB) only, cyberbullying only, and both) and mental concerns, risk behaviors, academic performance, physical health, and receipt of social support, with the logistic regressions adjusted for demographics. The past-12-month frequency of having experienced only cyberbullying was 5.6%, only ISTB was 9.1%, and both forms was 8.7%. Between-group differences were observed by bullying status in terms of sex and race/ethnicity. In adjusted models, bullying status was associated with suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-harm, depression/dysphoria, mental health, use of alcohol, marijuana, injection drugs, tobacco, and e-vapor, gambling, driving under influence of alcohol, high-risk sexual behavior, physical fights, weapon-carrying, injuries/threats at school, feeling unsafe at school, dating violence, obesity, poor general health, insecure housing, less perceived family support, and poor academic performance. People experiencing both types of bullying were typically more likely to report adverse measures. High-school students commonly report bullying. The findings that both forms (traditional and cyber) were more robustly linked to negative experiences highlight the need for examining further relationships between types and patterns of bullying and mental health and functioning.

The effect of the global financial crisis on preventable hospitalizations among the homeless in New York State,"White, Brandi; Ellis, Charles; Jones, Walter; Moran, William; Simpson, Kit","Objective Periods of economic instability may increase preventable hospitalizations because of increased barriers to accessing primary care. For underserved populations such as the homeless, these barriers may be more pronounced due to limited resources in the health care safety net. This study examined the impact of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 on access to care for the homeless in New York State. Methods Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) were used as a proxy measure for primary care access. Admissions for ACSCs were identified in the New York State Inpatient Database from 2006 to 2012. Hospitalization rates for ACSCs were calculated for the homeless and nonhomeless. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate the impact of the financial crisis on hospitalization rates for ACSCs. Results The findings indicate that during the financial crisis, homeless adults had significantly higher preventable hospitalizations than nonhomeless adults, and the uninsured homeless had significantly higher preventable hospitalizations when compared to other homeless subgroups. After the financial crisis, preventable hospitalizations for the homeless stabilized but remained at higher rates than those for the nonhomeless. Conclusions These findings are important to developing health policies designed to provide effective care for underserved population such as the homeless.",2018,,J Health Serv Res Policy,23,2,80-86,,10.1177/1355819617742180,,#3543,White 2018,,

Respondents reported SRH on a 5-point Likert type scale (poor to excellent), which we dichotomized into ""good or better"" and ""poor or fair"". We computed weighted percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and age-adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to investigate associations between SRH and HIV outcomes and demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics.RESULTS: Nationally, 72% of PWH reported ""good or better"" SRH. PWH with the following characteristics had a lower prevalence of ""good or better"" SRH, compared with those without: any missed HIV care appointment in the last 12 months (aPR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.81-0.91), symptoms of moderate or severe depression (aPR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.43-0.59) and anxiety (aPR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.54-0.68), unstable housing or homelessness (aPR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71-0.82), and hunger or food insecurity (aPR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69-0.80), as well as having a mean CD4 count <200 cells/mm 3 vs. CD4 + >500 cells/mm 3 (aPR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.86).CONCLUSIONS: Though SRH is a holistic measure reflective of HIV outcomes, integrated approaches addressing needs beyond physical health are necessary to improve SRH among PWH in the United States.

Examining Factors Associated with Cannabis Use Among Sexual and Gender Minority and Cisgender Heterosexual Emerging Adults in California,"Jauregui, Juan C.; Hong, Chenglin; Assaf, Ryan D.; Cunningham, Nicole J.; Krueger, Evan A.; Flynn, Risa; Holloway, Ian W.","Purpose: We explored correlates of cannabis risk and examined differences between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and cisgender heterosexual emerging adults (ages 18-29) in California. Methods: We recruited 1491 participants aged 18-29 years for a cross-sectional online survey. Ordinal logistic regressions assessed associations between minority stress (discrimination and internalized homophobia [IH]), social support (perceived social support and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer+ [LGBTQ+] community connectedness), and cannabis risk scores (low, medium, and high risk of developing problems related to their cannabis use). We also explored differences in cannabis risk scores by sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Results: Higher everyday discrimination scores were associated with increased odds of self-scoring in a higher cannabis risk range (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31-1.79). We found no significant associations for IH, LGBTQ+ community connectedness, or social support on cannabis risk scores. There were also no statistically significant differences by SOGI groups; however, SOGI did moderate the relationship between IH and cannabis risk score such that the slope for IH was 0.43 units higher for cisgender sexual minority women compared to cisgender sexual minority men (95% CI = 0.05-0.81). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that experiences of everyday discrimination are important contributors to developing cannabis-related problems and IH may have more pronounced effects for sexual minority women compared to sexual minority men.

Factors influencing the willingness of community service organisation staff to provide smoking cessation support: a qualitative study,"Parnell, Ashleigh; Box, Emily; Biagioni, Nicole; Bonevski, Billie; Anwar-McHenry, Julia; Slevin, Terry; Pettigrew, Simone","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore factors influencing community service organisation (CSO) staff members' willingness to provide tobacco cessation support to clients experiencing disadvantage.METHODS: Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 staff members from seven services in the alcohol and other drugs, homelessness, and mental health sectors in Western Australia.RESULTS: The primary barriers to providing cessation support were believing that addressing smoking was not a priority relative to other issues, being a current smoker, and the lack of a formal tobacco cessation program within the organisation. Factors that appeared to be most influential in enabling the delivery of cessation support were organisational processes requiring staff to routinely ask clients about tobacco use, confidence to provide support, and being a past smoker.CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of organisational procedures that include routine cessation care should be of high priority in CSOs to help reduce smoking rates among clients.

Assessing Differences in mHealth Usability and App Experiences Among Young African American Women: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Opper, Claudia A.; Browne, Felicia A.; Howard, Brittni N.; Zule, William A.; Wechsberg, Wendee M.","BACKGROUND: In North Carolina, HIV continues to disproportionately affect young African American women. Although mobile health (mHealth) technology appears to be a tool capable of making public health information more accessible for key populations, previous technology use and social determinants may impact users' mHealth experiences.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate mHealth usability, assessing differences based on previous technology use and social determinants among a sample of African American women in emerging adulthood.METHODS: As part of a National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded randomized controlled trial with African American women (aged 18-25 years), counties were assigned to receive an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention through mHealth and participants were asked to complete usability surveys at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Participants' first survey responses were analyzed through 2-tailed t tests and linear regression models to examine associations with previous technology use and social determinants (P<.05).RESULTS: The mean System Usability Scale (SUS) score was 69.2 (SD 17.9; n=159), which was higher than the threshold of acceptability (68.0). Participants who had previously used a tablet indicated higher usability compared to participants without previous use (mean 72.9, SD 18.1 vs mean 57.6, SD 11.4; P<.001), and participants with previous smartphone use also reported higher usability compared to participants without previous use (mean 71.9, SD 18.3 vs mean 58.0, SD 10.7; P<.001). Differences in SUS scores were observed among those reporting homelessness (mean 58.3, SD 19.0 vs mean 70.8, SD 17.2; P=.01), unemployment (mean 65.9, SD 17.2 vs mean 71.6, SD 18.1; P=.04), or current school enrollment (mean 73.2, SD 18.5 vs mean 65.4, SD 16.5; P=.006). Statistically significant associations were not observed for food insecurity (mean 67.3, SD 18.6 vs mean 69.9, SD 17.7; P=.45).CONCLUSIONS: Although above-average usability was observed overall, these findings demonstrate differences in mHealth usability based on past and current life experiences.

"Factors Associated with Smoking Cessation and the Receipt of Cessation Services in a Public, Safety-Net Primary Care System","Gu, Dian; Rafferty, Henry; Vijayaraghavan, Maya","BACKGROUND: Prevalence of smoking is high among patients receiving care in safety-net settings, and there is a need to better understand patient factors associated with smoking cessation and receipt of cessation services.OBJECTIVE: To identify patient factors associated with smoking cessation attempts and receipt of cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy in a large safety-net health system.DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using EHR data in a safety-net system in San Francisco, CA.PARTICIPANTS: We included 7384 adult current smokers who had at least three unique primary care encounters with documented smoking status between August 2019 and April 2022.MAIN MEASURES: We assessed four outcomes using multivariate generalized estimating equation models: (1) any cessation attempt, indicating a transition in smoking status from ""current smoker"" to ""former smoker""; (2) sustained cessation, defined as transition in smoking status from current smoker to former smokers for two or more consecutive visits; (3) receipt of smoking cessation counseling from healthcare providers; and (4) receipt of pharmacotherapy.KEY RESULTS: Of 7384 current adult smokers, 17.6% had made any cessation attempt, and of those 66.5% had sustained cessation. Most patients (81.1%) received counseling and 41.8% received pharmacotherapy. Factors associated with lower odds of any cessation attempt included being aged 45-64, non-Hispanic black, and experiencing homelessness. The factor associated with lower odds of sustained cessation was being male. Factors associated with lower odds of receiving counseling were being insured by Medicaid or being uninsured. Factors associated with lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy included speaking languages other than English, being male, and identifying as racial and ethnic minorities.CONCLUSIONS: Health system interventions could close the gap in access to smoking cessation services for unhoused and racial/ethnic minority patients in safety-net settings, thereby increasing cessation among these populations.",2024,,J Gen Intern Med,39,9,1657-1665,,10.1007/s11606-024-08664-3,,#3558,Gu 2024,,
Does future resource input reflect need in first-episode psychosis: Examining the association between individual characteristics and 5-year costs,"Hastrup, Lene H.; Nordentoft, Merete; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte","AIM: Coupling data on future resource consumption with baseline characteristics can provide vital information of future consumption patterns for newly diagnosed patients. This study tested whether higher need (as measured by severity of illness) and other baseline characteristics of newly diagnosed patients were associated with higher future service costs.METHOD: Five hundred forty-seven patients between 18 and 45 years randomized to the OPUS trial was analysed in the study. Multiple regression analysis was applied to estimate the impact of the explanatory variables on mean total costs, which consisted of total health care costs and costs of supportive living facilities.RESULTS: Lower age, higher level of symptoms (global assessment of functioning), alcohol or cannabis misuse, and being homeless were associated with higher total costs over 5 years, whereas sex, duration of untreated psychosis, and educational level did not show any impact on future resource consumption.CONCLUSION: The association between future costs and severity of illness suggests that higher needs among patients were associated with higher resource input level. Our results also indicate that other factors than need might affect future costs, for example, parents who serve as advocates for young patients had impact on future health costs. We also found indications of potential barriers among patients with other citizenship in access to health-care services.

Gains in life expectancy in the Australian population due to reductions in smoking: comparisons between interventions targeting the population versus interventions in a specific high risk group,"Mannan, Haider","BACKGROUND: Four decades of population-based tobacco control strategies have contributed to substantial reduction in smoking prevalence in Australia. However, smoking prevalence is still double in socially disadvantaged groups compared to those that are not. But not all tobacco control strategies successfully used in the general population is effective in specific high-risk population groups. Hence, an effective way to reduce smoking in high risk population groups may include targeting them specifically to identify and support smokers to quit. In this backdrop, we examined whether tobacco control interventions at the population-level are more effective in increasing life expectancy among Australians compared to interventions targeting a high risk group or a combination of the two when smoking prevalence is reduced to 10 and 0% respectively.METHODS: Using the risk percentiles approach, analyses were performed separately for men and women using data from various sources such as the 2014-15 National Health Survey linked to death registry, simulated data for high risk groups, and the Australian population and deaths data from the census. Indigenous status was simulated by preferentially assigning those who are indigenous to lower SES quintiles. The age-sex distribution of mental disorder status was simulated using its distribution from 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey with 25.9% of mentally ill being assigned to current smoking category and the rest to non-smoking category. The age-sex distribution of prisoners was simulated based on 2014 ABS Prisoners Australia survey with 74% of prisoners being assigned to current smoker category and the rest to non-smoker category. Homelessness status was simulated according to age, sex and indigenous status for 2011 census with all homeless being allocated to the lowest SES category. The age-sex distribution of total cholesterol level was simulated based on 2011-13 Australian Health Survey.RESULTS: The results showed that the combined approach for reducing smoking is most effective for improving life expectancy of Australians particularly for the socially disadvantaged and mentally ill groups both of which have high fraction of smokers in the population. For those who were mentally ill the gain in ALE due to reduction of smoking to 10% was 0.53 years for males and 0.36 years for females which were around 51 and 42% respectively of the maximal gains in ALE that could be achieved through complete cessation.CONCLUSIONS: Targeting high-risk population groups having substantial fraction of smokers in the population can strongly complement the existing population-based smoking reduction strategies. As population and high risk approaches are both important, the national prevention policies should make judicious use of both to maximize health gain.",2020,,BMC Public Health,20,1,1478,,10.1186/s12889-020-09600-w,,#3564,Mannan 2020,,
"Association of public care in childhood with social, criminal, cognitive, and health outcomes in middle-age: five decades of follow-up of members of the 1958 birth cohort study","Xie, Tiffany; de Mestral, Carlos; Batty, G. David","BACKGROUND: Children who have been exposed to public (out-of-home) care experience a range of negative outcomes by late adolescence and early adulthood. The longer-term impact of childhood care is, however, uncertain.AIM: To examine if there is a prospective association between childhood public care and adverse life outcomes in middle-age.METHODS: We used data from the UK 1958 birth cohort study of 18 558 individuals. Parents reported offspring care status at age 7, 11 and 16. An array of social, criminal, cognitive, and health outcomes was self-reported by cohort members at age 42 (71% response proportion in eligible sample) and a cognitive test battery was administered at age 50 (62% response).RESULTS: A total of 420 (3.8%) of 11 160 people in the analytical sample experienced childhood public care by age 16.

Microsystems of Recovery in Homeless Services: The Influence of Service Provider Values on Service Users' Recovery Experiences,"Manning, Rachel M.; Greenwood, Ronni Michelle","There is still much to learn about how aspects of the ecology of homelessness shape homeless adults' recovery experiences. In the present mixed-methods study, the relationship of service providers' work-related values to their service users' recovery experiences in the microsystem of homelessness were examined. Service providers completed semi-structured qualitative interviews about their service users, daily work activities, and work-related goals. At three time points, their service users completed quantitative measures of choice, mastery, and recovery in four life domains: physical health, psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and community integration. Service providers' interview transcripts were coded for three indicators of values: assumptions, actions, and end-states. Summative Content Analysis was used to transform qualitative codes into numeric data so they could be used to predict service users' recovery. In a series of growth curve models, the extent to which service providers' end-state values, as an indicator of consumer-led values, was shown to indirectly predict service users' recovery experiences, through their perceived choice and mastery. Findings confirm that providers' values are an important influence on service users' recovery. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for recovery-oriented theory and practice.",2018,,Am J Community Psychol,61,2-Jan,88-103,,10.1002/ajcp.12215,,#3570,Manning 2018,,
Who are the male partners of adolescent girls and young women in Swaziland? Analysis of survey data from community venues across 19 DREAMS districts,"Reynolds, Zahra; Gottert, Ann; Luben, Erin; Mamba, Bheki; Shabangu, Patrick; Dlamini, Nsindiso; Dlamini, Muhle; Mathur, Sanyukta; Pulerwitz, Julie","BACKGROUND: Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, ages 15-24) are at high risk of HIV in Swaziland. Understanding more about their male sexual partners can inform HIV prevention efforts for both.METHODS: Using the PLACE methodology across all 19 DREAMS implementation districts, 843 men ages 20-34 were surveyed between December 2016-February 2017. Surveys were conducted at 182 venues identified by community informants as places where AGYW and men meet/socialize. Descriptive and multivariate analyses examined characteristics and risk behaviors of male partners of AGYW.RESULTS: Men's average age was 25.7. Sixty-three percent reported female partners ages 15-19, and 70% reported partners ages 20-24 in the last year; of those, 12% and 11% respectively had five or more such partners. Among the 568 male partners of AGYW, 36% reported consistent condom use with their current/last partner. Forty-two percent reported testing for HIV in the last year; 6% were HIV-positive, and of those, 97% were currently on treatment. One-third (37%) reported being circumcised; among uncircumcised, 81% were not considering it. In multivariate analyses, men who reported three or more AGYW partners in the last year were more likely to be HIV-positive (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1,8.8). Men were also less likely to disclose their HIV status to adolescent versus older partners (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,0.9) and partners more than 5 years younger than themselves (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,0.9). Results also revealed relatively high unemployment and mobility, substantial financial responsibilities, and periodic homelessness.CONCLUSIONS: Most men identified through community venues reported relationships with AGYW, and these relationships demonstrated substantial HIV risk. Challenging life circumstances suggest structural factors may underlie some risk behaviors. Engaging men in HIV prevention and targeted health services is critical, and informant-identified community venues are promising intervention sites to reach high-risk male partners of AGYW.",2018,,PLoS One,13,9,e0203208,,10.1371/journal.pone.0203208,,#3573,Reynolds 2018,,
Homelessness in the Perinatal Period and Associations With Reproductive Interconception Care: 2016-2019 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System,"Galvin, Annalynn M.; Lewis, Melissa A.; Walters, Scott T.; Thompson, Erika L.","OBJECTIVES: Women experiencing homelessness have higher rates of unintended pregnancy than stably housed women and may benefit from reproductive interconception care. How reproductive interconception care differs between women who did and did not experience perinatal homelessness is not known. We estimated prevalence ratios of reproductive interconception behaviors among US women experiencing homelessness during the perinatal period.METHODS: We used data from the 2016-2019 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System to calculate the prevalence of 5 reproductive interconception care outcomes: attending a maternal postpartum checkup, participating in a conversation with a health care provider about birth intervals, receiving family planning counseling, obtaining a prescription for short-acting contraception, and having a long-acting reversible contraceptive inserted. We used complex survey weights, stratified by perinatal homelessness, and converted adjusted logistic regression odds ratios between housing status and outcome variables to adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% CIs.RESULTS: Among participants, approximately 2.4% (weighted percentage; unweighted 2953 of 100 706) experienced homelessness sometime in the 12 months before their children were born; the majority were non-Hispanic (83.2%) and White (69.4%), were not married (82.2%), and had public health insurance (56.8%). Perinatal homelessness was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of attending a postpartum maternal visit (aPR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94) and a higher prevalence of having a conversation about birth intervals with their health care providers (aPR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that improving attendance at postpartum visits and evaluating birth interval conversations may strengthen interconception care practices while contextualizing social determinants such as housing stability. Improving uptake of postpartum visits may reduce unintended pregnancy, short birth intervals, and adverse birth outcomes in future pregnancies among women experiencing homelessness.",2024,,Public Health Rep,139,4,458-466,,10.1177/00333549231204658,,#3576,Galvin 2024,,
Butt Why? Exploring factors associated with cigarette scavenging behaviors among adult smokers enrolling in a clinical trial for smoking cessation,"Lantini, Ryan; Sillice, Marie A.; Fava, Joseph L.; Jennings, Ernestine; Rosen, Rochelle K.; Horowitz, Santina M.; Becker, Bruce M.; Bock, Beth C.","INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking is associated with many adverse health effects and is an important public health concern. Increased understanding of smokers' behavior is central to developing effective interventions. Cigarette scavenging, a behavior that involves smoking shared or previously used cigarettes has thus far only been shown to be prevalent among homeless or incarcerated populations. The current study examines whether cigarette scavenging is prevalent in a more general population of adult smokers enrolling in a smoking cessation clinical trial, and whether engagement in this behavior is associated with demographic or smoking-related psychosocial factors.METHODS: Baseline data was obtained from adult smokers (N=227) enrolling in a randomized clinical trial for smoking cessation. Cigarette scavenging was assessed using three items: a) sharing a cigarette with a stranger; b) smoking a ""found"" cigarette and c) smoking a previously used cigarette ""butt"". Participants who endorsed engaging in at least one of these three behaviors were categorized as a scavenger.RESULTS: Approximately 32% of participants endorsed at least one cigarette scavenging behavior. A multiple logistic regression analysis found that scavengers were more likely to be: men (p<0.001), of younger age at smoking onset (p=0.012), unemployed (p=0.003), more likely to have used marijuana in the past 30days (p=0.005), single or living alone (p=0.003), and to have experienced higher withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts (p=0.044) as compared to non-scavengers.CONCLUSIONS: Scavenging is common among adult smokers. Interventions that address cigarette scavenging behaviors may better meet the needs of this unique smoking subgroup.",2018,,Addict Behav,78,,200-204,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.11.037,,#3579,Lantini 2018,,

Key informant interviews with service providers were used to augment findings.RESULTS: Participants identified 48 unique services or service approaches they believed would improve the health of residents in the area, including those addressing health care, mental health and addictions, youth, families, people experiencing homelessness, seniors, general social services, and services targeting specific populations. While service providers consistently identified a critical need for mental health and addiction services, community members placed greater importance on the social determinants of health including access to housing, job placement supports and training and service accessibility. Both groups agreed that services and programs for seniors and people experiencing homelessness would be highly important.CONCLUSION: Our study provides a unique example of using concept mapping as a tool to aid a rapid service gap analysis and community engagement in a metropolitan area.

HIV Treatment Cascade by Housing Status at Enrollment: Results from a Retention in Care Cohort,"Hawk, Mary; Maulsby, Catherine; Enobun, Blessing; Kinsky, Suzanne; AIDS United Retention in Care Intervention Team","Though housing instability is linked to poor HIV health outcomes, studies that assess the HIV treatment cascade by housing status are limited. Using data from a multi-site Retention in Care initiative we constructed HIV treatment cascades for participants (n = 463) of five grantee sites. We found no significant differences in viral suppression at follow-up among participants who were unstably housed at enrollment (49%) as compared to those who were stably housed at enrollment (54%). Among participants with available data at 6- or 12-month follow-up, 94% were engaged in care, 90% were retained in, 94% were on ART, and 71% had suppressed viral load. Some site-level differences were noted; at two of the sites participants who were stably housed were more likely to be retained in care and on ART. Overall, findings demonstrated that participants moved successfully through the HIV treatment cascade regardless of housing status at enrollment, suggesting that evidence-based support and services to help people living with HIV/AIDS can help mitigate barriers to engagement in care associated with lack of stable housing.",2019,,AIDS Behav,23,3,765-775,,10.1007/s10461-018-2295-y,,#3585,Hawk 2019,,
Please Be Careful with Me: Discrepancies between Adolescent Expectations and Clinician Perspectives on the Management of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,"Trent, Maria; Recto, Michelle; Qian, Qiang; Butz, Arlene; Frick, Kevin D.; Ellen, Jonathan M.; Lehmann, Harold","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare clinician perspectives for the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with those of adolescent patients and parents.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Urban academic pediatric and adolescent medicine practices and school-based health clinics in a large urban community with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and a national sample of adolescent-serving clinicians.PARTICIPANTS: Female patients aged 12-19 years, parents raising an adolescent older than the age of 12 years in the urban community, and clinicians who serve adolescents recruited from regional and national listservs.INTERVENTIONS: None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue scale scores on a scale of 0-10 corresponding to preferences on patient disposition in 17 clinical scenarios for a hypothetical patient with PID.RESULTS: Compared with adolescents, clinicians were significantly more likely to endorse hospitalizations when patients presented with severe or complicated illness (β = 0.9; standard error [SE], 0.22; P < .001), possible surgical emergency (β = 0.83; SE, 0.2; P < .001), concurrent pregnancy (β = 0.59; SE, 0.3; P = .046), or failure of outpatient treatment (β = 0.58; SE, 0.29; P = .045). Compared with clinicians, adolescents were significantly more likely to endorse hospitalizations when patients presented at a young age (β = 1.36; SE, 0.38; P < .001), were homeless (β = 0.88; SE, 0.32; P = .007), were afraid to inform a partner (β = 1.66; SE, 0.40; P < .001), or had unaware parents (β = 2.86; SE, 0.39; P < .001).CONCLUSION: Clinicians were more likely to recommend hospitalization when doing so adhered to national guidelines on PID treatment.

There are few studies on the prevalence and determinants of intestinal parasites infections in street dwellers, who may experience significant health and socioeconomic implications. Understanding the prevalence and associated factors of intestinal parasites in this population is crucial for targeted interventions to mitigate the spread of these infections.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites in street dwellers attending a shelter in Cali, Colombia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 66 participants who met the inclusion criteria. We collected serial stool samples for laboratory evaluation and sociodemographic data, and information on their hygiene habits and addictions.RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of the participants had intestinal parasites or commensals, with 30% presenting monoparasitism, 46% polyparasitism, and 20% eosinophilia. Blastocystis spp. was the most common organism (68.18%), followed by Endolimax nana (34.85%) and Entamoeba coli (18.18%). The most common pathogens were the Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar/E. moshkovskii complex (10.61%) and hookworms (9.09%). We evaluated prevalence-related determinants.CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal parasitism is a health problem among street dwellers in Cali. A serial examination is recommended for diagnosing intestinal parasitic infection, especially in cases of low parasite loads.

Experiences of homeless women in accessing health care in community-based settings: a qualitative systematic review,"Allen, Jodi; Vottero, Beth","INTRODUCTION: Homelessness among women is on the rise in the US and continues to be a concern globally. The challenges homeless women face are unique and vast, yet how they experience health care can greatly affect their desire to access health care in the future. The ability to shed light on what is meaningful to homeless women in their health care experiences can guide the changes necessary to provide appropriate patient-centered, impactful care with the goal of increasing access by this vulnerable population.OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify, appraise and synthesize existing qualitative evidence on the experiences of homeless women when accessing community-based health care services.INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review included studies on homeless women, both previously or currently, aged 18 or older. The phenomena of interest were homeless women's health care experiences, including perspectives, narratives and/or reflections, at any time during their period of homelessness. The review included health care services received by homeless women in community-based settings, shelter-based clinics and/or mobile clinics. Qualitative data including, but not limited to, the designs of phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, qualitative description, action research and feminist research were considered.METHODS: Using a three-step search strategy, databases of published and unpublished articles were searched from database inception to 2018. All included studies were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality, and data was extracted and pooled using the JBI System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information. Findings were rated according to their level of credibility, categorized based on similarity in meaning, and subjected to a meta-synthesis. Two reviewers utilized a meta-aggregative approach.RESULTS: A total of 196 qualitative articles were identified of which 24 were included after critical appraisal. Meta-synthesis generated three synthesized findings: (1) Homeless women who access health care services at community-based settings feel as if their homelessness qualifies them as second-class citizens, which impedes future access; (2) Homeless women have an expectation of therapeutic communication from their health care providers, the lack of which can incite negative emotional responses, fear and knowledge deficits; (3) Homeless women with limited resources struggle to prioritize competing needs, such as transportation, time and money, which influences their ability to access health care. These synthesized findings were derived from 47 study findings that were subsequently aggregated into 10 categories. Of the 47 study findings, 32 were rated as unequivocal and 15 were rated as credible. The overall ConQual for each of the three synthesized findings was low due to common dependability issues across the included studies. A total of 454 participants were included. The included studies were published from 1997 to 2017.CONCLUSION: The review identified that homeless women's experiences when accessing health care in community-based settings, particularly in the US, have been poor and have negatively affected their desire to access health care in the future. The synthesized findings illustrate clear indicators for use of cultural competence and addressing provider bias in the delivery of health care to homeless women. This review also highlights the importance of understanding clinical experiences of providing direct care for these women in order to shed light on the type of advocacy needed to ensure equitable access to health care services. While this review uncovered issues with some global health care systems, the predominance of system constraints within the US highlights the need for health policy reform to improve the experiences of homeless women when accessing health care.",2020,,JBI Evid Synth,18,9,1970-2010,,10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00214,,#3603,Allen 2020,,

Impacts on the individual, healthcare system, and society may be particularly striking within the veteran population due to the presence of physical and mental health comorbidities. Disease burden is also influenced by a complex interplay between social determinants of health and health disparities. The objective of the current study was to compare non-healthcare societal outcomes between veterans with and without schizophrenia in the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA).METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the VHA database (01/2013-09/2019; study period). Veterans with schizophrenia (≥2 diagnoses of ICD-9295.xx, ICD-10 F20.x, F21, and/or F25.x during the study period) were identified; the index date was the earliest observed schizophrenia diagnosis. Veterans with schizophrenia were propensity score-matched to those without schizophrenia using baseline characteristics. A 12-month baseline and variable follow-up period were applied. The frequency of unemployment, divorce, incarceration, premature death, and homelessness were compared between the matched cohorts using standardized mean difference (SMD). Risk of unemployment and homelessness were estimated using logistic regression models.RESULTS: A total of 102,207 veterans remained in each cohort after matching (91% male; 61% White [per AMA]; median age, 59 years). Among veterans with schizophrenia, 42% had a substance use disorder and 30% had mental health-related comorbidities, compared with 25 and 15%, respectively, of veterans without schizophrenia. Veterans with schizophrenia were more likely to experience unemployment (69% vs. 41%; SMD: 0.81), divorce (35% vs. 28%; SMD: 0.67), homelessness (28% vs. 7%; SMD: 0.57), incarceration (0.4% vs. 0.1%; SMD: 0.47), and premature death (14% vs. 12%; SMD < 0.1) than veterans without schizophrenia. After further adjustments, the risk of unemployment and of homelessness were 5.4 and 4.5 times higher among veterans with versus without schizophrenia. Other predictors of unemployment included Black [per AMA] race and history of substance use disorder; for homelessness, younger age (18-34 years) and history of mental health-related comorbidities were additional predictors.CONCLUSION: A greater likelihood of adverse societal outcomes was observed among veterans with versus without schizophrenia. Given their elevated risk for unemployment and homelessness, veterans with schizophrenia should be a focus of targeted, multifactorial interventions to reduce disease burden.",2022,,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,458,,10.1186/s12888-022-04022-x,,#3606,Lin 2022,,
"A classification model of homelessness using integrated administrative data: Implications for targeting interventions to improve the housing status, health and well-being of a highly vulnerable population","Byrne, Thomas; Baggett, Travis; Land, Thomas; Bernson, Dana; Hood, Maria-Elena; Kennedy-Perez, Cheryl; Monterrey, Rodrigo; Smelson, David; Dones, Marc; Bharel, Monica","Homelessness is poorly captured in most administrative data sets making it difficult to understand how, when, and where this population can be better served. This study sought to develop and validate a classification model of homelessness. Our sample included 5,050,639 individuals aged 11 years and older who were included in a linked dataset of administrative records from multiple state-maintained databases in Massachusetts for the period from 2011-2015. We used logistic regression to develop a classification model with 94 predictors and subsequently tested its performance. The model had high specificity (95.4%), moderate sensitivity (77.8%) for predicting known cases of homelessness, and excellent classification properties (area under the receiver operating curve 0.94; balanced accuracy 86.4%). To demonstrate the potential opportunity that exists for using such a modeling approach to target interventions to mitigate the risk of an adverse health outcome, we also estimated the association between model predicted homeless status and fatal opioid overdoses, finding that model predicted homeless status was associated with a nearly 23-fold increase in the risk of fatal opioid overdose. This study provides a novel approach for identifying homelessness using integrated administrative data. The strong performance of our model underscores the potential value of linking data from multiple service systems to improve the identification of housing instability and to assist government in developing programs that seek to improve health and other outcomes for homeless individuals.",2020,,PLoS One,15,8,e0237905,,10.1371/journal.pone.0237905,,#3609,Byrne 2020,,
A Novel Inpatient Buprenorphine Induction Program for Adolescents With Opioid Use Disorder,"Trope, Lee A.; Stemmle, Monica; Chang, Annie; Bashiri, Nasrin; Bazazi, Alexander R.; Lightfoot, Marguerita; Congdon, Jayme L.","BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from nonprescribed opioid use and opioid use disorder (OUD) in adolescents have risen dramatically. Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) with buprenorphine reduces nonprescribed opioid use and prevents overdoses, though <5% of adolescents with OUD have timely access, partly because of barriers associated with buprenorphine induction. Induction in an inpatient pediatric setting has the potential to address such barriers and improve adolescent MOUD access.METHODS: We developed and implemented a protocol for inpatient buprenorphine induction and linkage to MOUD care within a safety-net health system. After 1 year, we conducted descriptive analysis of participant characteristics, rates of induction completion and treatment linkage, and adverse events. We analyzed field notes from multidisciplinary huddles to identify implementation facilitators and barriers.RESULTS: During May 2021 to July 2022, we completed 46 admissions for 36 patients aged 12 to 21 years. All used fentanyl and no other opioids. Forty of 46 (87%) admissions resulted in completed induction, and 3 additional patients never developed withdrawal symptoms and were discharged with maintenance buprenorphine. Linkage to ongoing treatment occurred within 2 weeks for 31 of 43 (72%) admissions for which buprenorphine was started. We identified facilitators and barriers to program implementation and maintenance.CONCLUSION: These results provide promising preliminary evidence of the feasibility of inpatient buprenorphine induction for adolescents with OUD. Given the public health urgency and severe shortage of adolescent access to MOUD, these results prompt consideration of broader clinical implementation and research to facilitate rapid expansion of access to evidence-based OUD care.",2023,,Hosp Pediatr,13,2,e23-e28,,10.1542/hpeds.2022-006864,,#3612,Trope 2023,,
Injection drug use and overdose among young adults who use prescription opioids non-medically,"Liebling, Elliott J.; Green, Traci C.; Hadland, Scott E.; Marshall, Brandon D. L.","INTRODUCTION: Non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) use is a critical public health problem in the United States, with 2.1 million new initiates annually. Young adult NMPO users are at high risk for initiating injection drug use. We assessed correlates of injection drug use among young adult NMPO users in Rhode Island, a state heavily impacted by opioid overdose.METHODS: We used data from the Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription Drug Study (RAPiDS), which recruited 199 residents aged 18-29 who reported past-30-day NMPO use (65.3% male). We compared individuals who reported ever having injected with individuals who reported never injecting, using logistic regression to identify independent correlates of injection.RESULTS: Among eligible participants, the mean age was 24.6years and 61.3% were white. Over one-quarter (n=59, 29.6%) of the sample had ever injected drugs. The majority (n=46, 78.0%) of participants who had ever injected drugs reported injecting heroin as her/his first drug; the majority also reported previously snorting her/his first drug that was injected (n=46, 78.0%). In multivariable analyses, white race, older age, lifetime homelessness, and ever having overdosed or seen someone overdose were independently associated with an increased likelihood of ever injecting drugs.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a high prevalence of lifetime injection drug use among young adults who use prescription opioids non-medically. Given the observed associations between injection drug use and witnessing as well as experiencing overdose, interventions are urgently needed to improve overdose education and naloxone distribution to young adult NMPO users who inject drugs.",2018,,Addict Behav,76,,20-26,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.07.017,,#3615,Liebling 2018,,
Harm reduction in an emergency response to homelessness during South Africa's COVID-19 lockdown,"Marcus, Tessa S.; Heese, Jan; Scheibe, Andrew; Shelly, Shaun; Lalla, Sasha X.; Hugo, Jannie F.","BACKGROUND: Caledonian Stadium, the main mass temporary shelter for homeless people in the City of Tshwane, was created as a local response to the imperatives of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) National State of Disaster lockdown in South Africa. This is a case study of the coordinated emergency healthcare response provided by the University of Pretoria's Department of Family Medicine between 24 March and 6 April 2020.METHODS: This study uses a narrative approach to restory situated, transient, partial and provisional knowledge. Analysis is based on documented data and iteratively triangulated interviews on the operational experiences of selected healthcare first responders directly involved in the shelter.RESULTS: The impending lockdown generated intense interactions by UP-DFM to prepare for the provision of COVID-19 and essential generalist primary with partners involved in the Community Oriented Substance Use Programme (COSUP). With approximately 2000 people at the shelter at its peak, the numbers exceeded expectations. Throughout, while government officials tried to secure bedding, food and toilets, the shelter was poorly equipped and without onsite management. The COSUP clinical team prioritised opioid substitution therapy using methadone and COVID-19 screening over generalist healthcare to manage withdrawal and contain tension and anxiety. COSUP and its partners helped the city plan and implement the safe re-sheltering of all Caledonian residents.CONCLUSION: The Caledonian shelter is an account of organisational resilience in the face of homelessness and substance use emergencies triggered by lockdown. Through community-oriented, bottom-up self-organisation, a clinically led team navigated a response to the immediate needs of people who are homeless and/or use drugs that evolved into a more sustainable intervention. Key lessons learnt were the importance of communicating with people directly affected by emergencies, the value of using methadone to reduce harms during emergencies and the imperative of including OST in essential primary healthcare.",2020,,Harm Reduct J,17,1,60,,10.1186/s12954-020-00404-0,,#3618,Marcus 2020,,
Psychiatric Disorders in Hospitalized Homeless Individuals: A Nationwide Study,"Trivedi, Chintan; Adnan, Mahwish; Shah, Kaushal; Manikkara, Geetha; Mansuri, Zeeshan; Jain, Shailesh","Objective: To compare the incidence of inpatient psychiatric admissions and evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among homeless individuals. Methods: This cross-sectional study utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset for the year 2016-2017. US adult homeless patients (age ≥ 18 years) admitted to the hospital were age and sex matched (1:1) with non-homeless individuals using the propensity score matching technique. Results: The study included a total of 614,390 homeless patients (mean age = 46.1 years, 71.9% male). Most of the homeless patients were Black (24.8% vs 17.3% of the non-homeless population). Mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders were highly prevalent in homeless patients compared to those who were non-homeless (P < .001). Composite of psychiatric disorders was also significantly higher in the homeless group (64.9% vs 29.1%, P < .001). Suicidal ideation was present in 19.4% of the homeless individuals and in 2.9% of the non-homeless (P < .001). Hospital admissions related to any psychiatric condition were 33.9% in the homeless and 6.7% in the non-homeless (P < .001). Compared to the non-homeless, homeless patients admitted for psychiatric disorders had longer inpatient psychiatric admissions (8.7 vs 7.7 days, P < .001). Conclusions: The results revealed a positive association between homelessness, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and suicidal ideations/attempts. Appropriate psychiatric screening measures are needed for the homeless. Homelessness is associated with longer inpatient psychiatric stay. The challenges faced in treating and preventing mental illness in the homeless should be investigated further.",2022,,Prim Care Companion CNS Disord,24,6,21m03209,,10.4088/PCC.21m03209,,#3621,Trivedi 2022,,
Homelessness as a predictor of mortality: an 11-year register-based cohort study,"Feodor Nilsson, Sandra; Laursen, Thomas Munk; Hjorthøj, Carsten; Nordentoft, Merete","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between homelessness and psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, on one hand, and cause-specific and all-cause mortality on the other in a high-income country.METHODS: A historical nationwide register-based cohort study of the Danish population from 15 years of age between 2000 and 2011 was conducted. The association between homelessness, psychiatric disorders, and mortality was analysed by Poisson Regression adjusting for important confounders. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for people with a history of homelessness compared with the general population using direct age-standardisation.RESULTS: During 51,892,324 person-years of observation, 656,448 died. People with at least one homeless shelter contact accounted for 173,592 person-years with 4345 deaths. The excess mortality in the population experiencing homelessness compared with the general population was reduced by 50% after adjusting for psychiatric diagnoses, including substance use disorders (mortality rate ratio (MRR) for men 3.30, 95% CI 3.18-3.41; women 4.41, 95% CI 4.14-4.71). Full adjustment including physical comorbidity and socioeconomic factors in a sub-cohort aged 15-29 years resulted in an MRR of 3.94 (95% CI 3.10-5.02) compared with the general population. The excess mortality associated with homelessness differed according to psychiatric diagnosis, sex, and cause of death.CONCLUSIONS: A mental health or a substance use disorder combined with homelessness considerably increases the risk of death. However, homelessness is also independently associated with high mortality. Differences in the association between homelessness and mortality in men and women suggest the need for sex-tailored interventions.",2018,,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,53,1,63-75,,10.1007/s00127-017-1456-z,,#3624,FeodorNilsson 2018,,
Dual HIV risk and vulnerabilities among people who inject drugs in Iran: Findings from a nationwide study in 2020,"Mehmandoost, Soheil; Khezri, Mehrdad; Aghaali, Niloofar; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Haghdoost, Ali Akbar; Tavakoli, Fatemeh; Sharifi, Hamid; Karamouzian, Mohammad","INTRODUCTION: People who inject drugs (PWID) are a key population at risk of HIV in Iran. We measured the prevalence and covariates of HIV-related risk behaviours among PWID in Iran.METHODS: We conducted a respondent-driven bio-behavioural surveillance survey among PWID from July 2019 to March 2020 in 11 major cities. We assessed PWID's recent (i.e., last three months) HIV-related risk behaviours using a four-level categorical variable: Only unsafe injection (i.e., sharing needles/syringes or injecting equipment), only unsafe sex (i.e., unprotected sex), dual HIV risk (i.e., both unsafe injection and unprotected sex), and safe injection and sex. Data were summarized using RDS-weighted analysis. Multinomial logistic regression models were built to characterize HIV-related risk behaviours and relative risk ratio (RRR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported.RESULTS: Overall, 2562 men who inject drugs (MWID) were included in the regression analysis. The RDS-weighted prevalence of dual HIV risk was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.8, 1.9), only unsafe injection was 4.5%, and only unsafe sex was 11.8%. Compared to the safe injection and sex group, dual HIV risk was significantly and positively associated with multiple partnership (RRR = 15.06; 3.30, 68.73). Only unsafe injection was significantly associated with homelessness in the last 12 months (RRR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.34, 6.80). Only unsafe sex was significantly associated with multiple partnership (RRR = 6.66; 4.27, 10.38), receiving free condoms (RRR = 1.71; 1.01, 2.89), receiving free needles (RRR = 2.18; 1.22, 3.90), and self-received risk for HIV (RRR = 2.51; 1.36, 4.66). Moreover, history of HIV-testing in the last three months was significantly associated with only unsafe injection (RRR = 2.71; 1.84, 3.80). Among the 90 women who injected drugs, none reported dual HIV risk behaviours.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: While the low prevalence of dual HIV risk among PWID is encouraging, unprotected sexual practices among PWID is concerning. Expanding sexual health education and care services as well as tailored interventions aimed at reducing high-risk sexual activities among PWID are warranted. Additionally, tackling potential misperceptions about risk of HIV transmission among PWID in Iran is warranted.",2024,,Harm Reduct J,21,1,187,,10.1186/s12954-024-01107-6,,#3627,Mehmandoost 2024,,
Housing and supportive services for young mothers experiencing substance use disorder and homelessness: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized trial,"Yilmazer, Tansel; Zhang, Jing; Chavez, Laura; Famelia, Ruri; Feng, Xin; Ford, Jodi; Kelleher, Kelly; Slesnick, Natasha","BACKGROUND: Mothers experiencing homelessness and caring for young children struggle with high rates of substance use and mental health problems. A comprehensive supportive housing intervention was implemented to assist young mothers experiencing substance use disorder (SUD) and homelessness. The cost-effectiveness of this intensive intervention could inform future dissemination.METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial that lasted from May 2015 to October 2018. Mothers experiencing homelessness between the ages of 18-24 years with a SUD were randomly assigned to housing+support services (HOU + SS) (n = 80), housing-only (HOU) (n = 80), or services as usual SAU (n = 80). Using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), the study compared the costs of HOU + SS and HOU to SAU for three outcomes: housing stability (percent days of stable housing), substance use (percent days of substance use), and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory score). Direct intervention costs of HOU + SS and HOU from both payor and societal perspectives were estimated. Cost data were collected from detailed study financial records. Outcomes were taken from 6-month assessments.RESULTS: The average societal cost of HOU + SS per participant was $5114 [CI 95 %, $4949-5278], while the average societal cost of HOU was $3248 [CI 95 %, $ 3,140-$3341] (2019 U.S. dollars). The calculated ICERs show that HOU was more cost-effective than HOU + SS and SAU for housing outcome. For illicit drug use, HOU + SS was more cost-effective than HOU. Finally, for depressive symptoms, neither HOU + SS or HOU were more cost effective than SAU.CONCLUSION: While HOU is more cost-effective for increasing housing, HOU + SS is more cost-effective for reducing illicit drug use. However, housing without improvements in substance use may not be sustainable, and supportive services are likely essential for improved well-being overall beyond the housing outcome alone.",2024,,J Subst Use Addict Treat,166,,209494,,10.1016/j.josat.2024.209494,,#3630,Yilmazer 2024,,

A dearth of research has explored the factors that predict incarceration among transgender women or the longitudinal impact of incarceration on the health of this population.METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 221 transgender women ages 16-29 from Boston, MA and Chicago, IL were prospectively assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. Mixed effects models were used to identify risk factors for incarceration and examine whether incarceration predicts somatic, anxiety and depressive symptoms, illicit drug use, and binge drinking over time, controlling for baseline psychiatric and substance use disorders.RESULTS: Overall, 38% experienced incarceration, before (33%) and during (18%) the study period. Significant independent predictors of recent incarceration included sex work, recent homelessness, school dropout and number of times incarcerated prior to enrollment while recent incarceration significantly predicted somatic symptoms and illicit drug use over time.CONCLUSIONS: Incarceration burden is high in young transgender women.

Seeking menstrual products: a qualitative exploration of the unmet menstrual needs of individuals experiencing homelessness in New York City,"Gruer, Caitlin; Hopper, Kim; Smith, Rachel Clark; Kelly, Erin; Maroko, Andrew; Sommer, Marni","BACKGROUND: There has been increasing recognition that certain vulnerable populations in the United States of America struggle to meet their menstruation-related needs, including people experiencing homelessness. Media and policy attention on this subject has focused on the provision of free menstrual products to vulnerable populations, including a New York City legislative bill, which guarantees access to menstrual products for Department of Homeless Services shelter residents (Intros 1123-A).METHODS: This qualitative study explored the challenges people experiencing homelessness in New York City face in accessing menstrual products. Data collection was conducted from June to August 2019 and included: Semi-structured key informant interviews with staff from relevant government agencies and homeless service providers (n = 15), and semi-structured in-depth interviews with individuals with experience living on the street and in shelters (n = 22). Data were analysed using thematic analysis.RESULTS: Key themes that emerged included: (1) insufficient and inconsistent access to menstrual products; (2) systemic challenges to providing menstrual products; and (3) creative solutions to promote access to menstrual products. Both shelter- and street-living individuals reported significant barriers to accessing menstrual products. While both populations struggle, those in shelters were more likely to be able to purchase menstrual products or access free products at their shelter, while those living on the streets were more likely to have to resort to panhandling, theft, or using makeshift materials in place of menstrual products. Across both populations, individuals described barriers to accessing free products at shelters and service providers, primarily due to distribution systems that rely on gatekeepers to provide a few pads or tampons at a time, sometimes of inadequate quality and only upon request. Shelters and service providers also described challenges providing these products, including inconsistent supply.CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical importance of expanding and improving initiatives seeking to provide access to menstrual products for vulnerable populations. Despite policy level efforts to support menstrual product access, individuals experiencing homelessness in New York City, whether living in shelters or on the street, are often not able to access the menstrual products that they need to manage their monthly menstrual flow.",2021,,Reprod Health,18,1,77,,10.1186/s12978-021-01133-8,,#3636,Gruer 2021,,
What is usual care for teenagers expecting their first child in England? A process evaluation using key informant mapping and participant survey as part of the Building Blocks randomised controlled trial of specialist home visiting,"Robling, Michael; Cannings-John, Rebecca; Channon, Sue; Hood, Kerenza; Moody, Gwen; Poole, Ria; Sanders, Julia","OBJECTIVES: We compared the US-derived Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) home visiting programme when added to usually provided health and social care for first-time teenage mothers, to usual care alone. We aimed to: establish the nature of usual care, measure service usage and assess performance bias in core usual care services.DESIGN: Within trial process evaluation. Local professionals completed a survey mapping local health and social care services in seven domains. This focused on services available to young women, especially those relevant to pregnant teenagers. Descriptive data were assessed thematically to establish the range of services. Quantitative data collection with FNP supervisors enumerated service provision by site. Services identified were included in main participant trial follow-up interviews at four time points to quantify usage. Usage was described descriptively by domain. We explored predictors of health visitor visits.SETTING: 18 partnerships of local authority and healthcare organisations in England.OUTCOMES: Descriptive framework of services. Rates of service usage reported by trial participants.RESULTS: 161 separate services were identified, with multiple service models in each domain, broadly categorised as universal or specialist (eg, for teenage mothers). FNP supervisors identified 30-63 universal services per site and 22-67 specialist services. Use of core maternity care services was similar across trial arms and with only small differences in use of health visiting services. Participants accessed a wide range of services. Women who had ever been homeless, who had a higher subjectively defined social status, and poorer mental health received more visits from a health visitor.CONCLUSIONS: The large number of services available to teenage mothers in England may limit the incremental benefit achievable through enhanced home visiting. There was little evidence of compensatory practice, such as additional care for women in the usual care arm. Measuring usual care when trialling complex interventions is challenging and essential.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN23019866.",2018,,BMJ Open,8,5,e020152,,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020152,,#3639,Robling 2018,,
High response and re-infection rates among people who inject drugs treated for hepatitis C in a community needle and syringe programme,"Schulkind, Jasmine; Stephens, Brian; Ahmad, Farsana; Johnston, Linda; Hutchinson, Sharon; Thain, Donna; Ward, Zoe; Vickerman, Peter; Hickman, Matt; Dillon, John F.","To achieve WHO hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination targets by 2030, mathematical models suggest there needs to be significant scale-up of treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID). We tested whether people who actively inject drugs can be recruited and treated successfully through a community needle and syringe programme (NSP), and assessed rates of re-infection. 105 HCV RNA positive participants were enrolled prospectively. Participants were recruited from the largest NSP in Dundee over 42 months. 94/105 individuals commenced treatment. Genotype 1 (G1) individuals (n = 37) were treated with peg-interferon+ribavirin+Simepravir/Telaprevir. Genotype 2/3 (G2/3) (n = 57) received peg-interferon+ribavirin. Weekly study visits took place within the NSP. Mean age of participants was 34.0 years (SD 6.9), 71.3% (61/94) were male. One in five (20/94) participants were homeless. 68.1% (64/94) were on OST (opiate substitution therapy) at enrolment; participants injected median 6.5 times/wk. In terms of clinical outcomes, >80% treatment adherence was 71.3% (67/94). There was no difference in SVR-12 rates by genotype: 81.0% (30/37) for G1 and 82.5% (47/55) for G2/3. At 18 months post-treatment, 15/77 participants were reinfected, followed up over 69.8 person-years, yielding a re-infection rate of 21.5/100 person-years (95% CI 13.00-35.65). This trial demonstrates that HCV treatment can be delivered successfully to the target population of treatment as prevention strategies. We report higher rates of re-infection than existing estimates among PWID. Scale-up of HCV treatment should be pursued alongside a comprehensive programme of harm reduction interventions to help minimize re-infection and reduce HCV transmission.",2019,,J Viral Hepat,26,5,519-528,,10.1111/jvh.13035,,#3642,Schulkind 2019,,
Gambling participation among Connecticut adolescents from 2007 to 2019: Potential risk and protective factors,"Stefanovics, Elina A.; Gueorguieva, Ralitza; Zhai, Zu Wei; Potenza, Marc N.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gambling in adolescents is a public health concern. This study sought to examine patterns of gambling among Connecticut high-school students using seven representative samples covering a 12-year period.METHODS: Data were analyzed from N = 14,401 participants in cross-sectional surveys conducted every two years based on random sampling from schools in the state of Connecticut. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires included socio-demographic data, current substance use, social support, and traumatic experiences at school. Chi-square tests were used to compare socio-demographic characteristics between gambling and non-gambling groups. Logistic regressions were used to assess changes in the prevalence of gambling over time and effects of potential risk factors on the prevalence, adjusted for age, sex, and race.RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of gambling largely decreased from 2007 to 2019, although the pattern was not linear. After steadily declining from 2007 to 2017, 2019 was associated with increased rates of gambling participation. Consistent statistical predictors of gambling were male gender, older age, alcohol and marijuana use, higher levels of traumatic experiences at school, depression, and low levels of social support.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Among adolescents, older males may be particularly vulnerable to gambling that relates importantly to substance use, trauma, affective concerns, and poor support. Although gambling participation appears to have declined, the recent increase in 2019 that coincides with increased sports gambling advertisements, media coverage and availability warrants further study. Our findings suggest the importance of developing school-based social support programs that may help reduce adolescent gambling.",2023,,J Behav Addict,12,2,490-499,,10.1556/2006.2023.00027,,#3645,Stefanovics 2023,,

This study aimed to evaluate a new method for rapid camera-based non-contact measurement of heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure.METHODS: Consecutive adult patients attending a hospital emergency department for suspected COVID-19 infection were invited to participate. Vital signs measured with a new camera-based method were compared to the corresponding standard reference methods. The camera device observed the patient's face for 30 s from ∼1 m.RESULTS: Between 1 April and 1 October 2020, 214 subjects were included in the trial, 131 female (61%) and 83 male (39%). The mean age was 44 years (range 18-81 years). The new camera-based device's vital signs measurements were, on average, very close to the gold standard but the random variation was larger than the reference methods.CONCLUSIONS: The principle of contactless measurement of blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation works, which is very promising. However, technical improvements to the equipment used in this study to reduce its random variability is required before clinical implementation.

Treatment trajectories and barriers in opioid agonist therapy for people who inject drugs in rural Puerto Rico,"Abadie, Roberto; McLean, Katherine; Habecker, Patrick; Dombrowski, Kirk","BACKGROUND: Research has shown medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to have positive effects, including reducing HIV and HCV transmission, but important barriers to access remain among people who inject drugs (PWID). Barriers include lack of social and familial support, bureaucracy, distance to treatment, poverty, and homelessness. However, we know little about how these barriers interact with each other to shape PWID's drug treatment access and retention.METHODS: We used qualitative methods with a dataset from a study conducted during 2019 with 31 active PWID residing in rural Puerto Rico. The study gathered ethnographic data and narratives about treatment trajectories to document the lived experiences of PWID as they moved in and out of treatment.RESULTS: Participants were at least 18 years old; 87.7% were male, the mean age was 44.1 years, and the mean age at first injection was 22 years. Participants identified homelessness, lack of proper ID or other identifying documents, and previous negative experiences with MOUD as the main barriers to treatment entry and retention. In addition, PWID's belief that MOUD simply substitutes an illegal drug for a legal one, while furthering drug dependence by chronically subjecting patients to treatment, constitutes an additional barrier to entry. Findings from this study demonstrate that MOUD barriers to access and retention compound and are severely affected by poverty and other forms of vulnerability among PWID in rural Puerto Rico.CONCLUSION: Policies to increase access and retention should consider barriers not in isolation but as an assemblage of many factors.",2021,,J Subst Abuse Treat,127,,108347,,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108347,,#3651,Abadie 2021,,

We analyzed 2006-2016 surveillance system data to understand the characteristics and circumstances of heat-associated deaths.METHODS: We classified heat-associated deaths based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes (X30, T67.X, and P81.0) and phrases (heat exposure, environ, exhaustion, sun, heat stress, heat stroke, or hyperthermia) in part I or part II of the death certificate. We summarized data on decedents' demographic characteristics, years lived in Arizona, location of death (indoors vs outdoors), presence and functionality of air conditioning, and whether the decedent had been homeless. We examined significant associations between variables by using the Pearson χ2 tests and logistic regression.RESULTS: During 2006-2016, MCDPH recorded data on 920 heat-associated deaths, 912 of which included location of injury. Of 565 (62%) heat-associated deaths that occurred outdoors, 458 (81%) were among male decedents and 243 (43%) were among decedents aged 20-49. Of 347 (38%) heat-associated deaths that occurred indoors, 201 (58%) were among decedents aged ≥65. Non-Arizona residents were 5 times as likely as Arizona residents to have a heat-associated death outdoors (P < .001). Of 727 decedents with data on duration of Arizona residency, 438 (60%) had resided in Arizona ≥20 years.CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing evaluation of interventions that target populations at risk for both outdoor and indoor heat-associated deaths can further inform refinement of the surveillance system and identify best practices to prevent heat-associated deaths.",2020,,Public Health Rep,135,5,631-639,,10.1177/0033354920938006,,#3654,Iverson 2020,,

A community-engaged participatory qualitative study was conducted in Flint, Michigan, USA, to understand the needs of special populations (young women, perinatal women and new mothers, older women, women with disabilities, and LGBTQIA women) and elicit their ideas about solutions.METHODS: In-depth interviews (n = 100) were conducted. Participants were either women living in the Flint area, human service providers in the area, or both. A team of community and academic coders analyzed the data using an a priori framework.RESULTS: Participants identified needs of different groups of women and suggested ways to address them. Access to healthy food, reducing healthcare costs, and improving transportation, job opportunities and affordable quality housing were crosscutting themes across all groups of women. Mentoring support was said to protect vulnerable young women from the risk of human trafficking. Older women were said to gain a sense of purpose, build their social support and reduce their loneliness by engaging in mentoring younger women. Women with disabilities were reported to benefit from infrastructure accessibility and authentic inclusion in all areas of life. Providing help that considers their dignity, pride and self-worth were suggested. LGBTQIA women were reported to have housing needs due to discrimination; mostly turned down as renters and can be rejected from faith-based homeless shelters. LGBTQIA women would also benefit from increased sensitivity among healthcare providers. For all groups of women, streamlining access to social services and other resources, building social support networks and increasing awareness about existing resources were recommended.CONCLUSION: Efforts directed towards improving women's health and wellbeing should include perspectives and suggestions of diverse groups of women from the community. Acting on suggestions that emanate from the community's lived experiences may reduce inequalities in health and wellbeing.",2020,,Int J Equity Health,19,1,18,,10.1186/s12939-020-1133-9,,#3660,Hailemariam 2020,,
Implementation and outcomes of a statewide TBI screening program for underserved populations,"Akaberi, Seyedeh Melika; Nguyen, Elaine; Carr, Glenda; Spearman, Russell; Shadduck, Stefanie","The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation and outcomes of a unique traumatic brain injury (TBI) screening initiative serving the community, with a focus on underserved populations. Idaho's definition of underserved populations includes people living in rural/frontier areas, people experiencing homelessness or intimate partner violence, people with co-occurring disorders, and people with cultural and/or linguistically diverse backgrounds. The goals of screenings are to help participants gain awareness about the likelihood of having experienced a TBI, bridge the gap in TBI reporting, and provide needed support to underserved populations in a rural state. Our work represents a cross-sectional study. Beginning in 2014, TBI screenings were conducted by the Institute of Rural Health within a public health university with several internal and external partners, as well as grant funding for work. Trained interprofessional health students and/or members of the Institute of Rural Health performed TBI screenings using the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method-Interview Form. Those who screened as likely experiencing a TBI received resources for care and follow-up telephone calls. Data were collected on the number of individuals screened and their results and reported using descriptive statistics. From 2014 to 2022, a total of 1333 individuals were screened at 23 different community events across Idaho. Over 30% of screened individuals reported a history of head or neck injury, primarily due to falls and being hit by objects. The majority of identified cases of TBI were characterized by no loss of consciousness or <30 min of unconsciousness. Screenings targeting underserved populations showed higher TBI prevalence. Targeting underserved populations proved valuable in identifying TBI cases. The collaborative and interprofessional approach of this screening is unique and highlights the potential to address complex health issues effectively. These findings offer valuable insights for others implementing TBI screening programs in community settings.",2024,,Int J Qual Health Care,36,2,mzae047,,10.1093/intqhc/mzae047,,#3663,Akaberi 2024,,
Creating value for communities: Los Angeles County's investment in Housing for Health,"Gupta, Reshma; Ghaly, Mark; Todoroff, Cheri; Wali, Soma","With U.S. healthcare expenditures leading and social service spending trailing other developed nations, patients, caregivers, and employers are insisting on improved value in health and healthcare for communities. Yet, health systems struggle to understand how to best invest existing funding or savings to reach these goals. We share the experience of Los Angeles County's health system that has invested in housing through their Housing for Health Program (HFH) to address the needs of high cost populations within communities. The approach rested on four key program strategies including having partnerships with various housing facilities, a whole person approach with broad community-based resources, a local footprint in community health services, and a robust jail and prison transitions program. HFH also relied on three key implementation strategies including having dynamic funding sources, stakeholder alignment, and continuous improvement. This case report describes these program and implementation strategies plus challenges and lessons learned navigating homeless individuals through the regulations of various funding contracts, maintaining service provider capacity, maintaining local culture in implementation, and persistent gaps in affordable housing availability. Future policies can incentivize similar efforts and infrastructure to transfer healthcare dollars into public services to improve housing and value for communities.",2020,,Healthc (Amst),8,1,100387,,10.1016/j.hjdsi.2019.100387,,#3666,Gupta 2020,,
Exchange sex among people receiving medical care for HIV in the United States - medical monitoring project 2009-2013,"Olaiya, Oluwatosin; Nerlander, Lina; Mattson, Christine L.; Beer, Linda","Many studies of persons who exchange sex for money or drugs have focused on their HIV acquisition risk, and are often limited to select populations and/or geographical locations. National estimates of exchange sex among people living with HIV (PLWH) who are in medical care, and its correlates, are lacking. To address these gaps, we analyzed data from the Medical Monitoring Project, a surveillance system that produces nationally representative estimates of behavioral and clinical characteristics of PLWH receiving medical care in the United States, to estimate the weighted prevalence of exchange sex overall, and by selected socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics. We found 3.6% of sexually active adults reported exchange sex in the past 12 months. We found a higher prevalence of exchange sex among transgender persons, those who experienced homelessness, and those with unmet needs for social and medical services. Persons who exchanged sex were more likely to report depression and substance use than those who did not exchange sex. We found a higher prevalence of sexual behaviors that increase the risk of HIV transmission and lower viral suppression among persons who exchanged sex. PLWH who exchanged sex had a higher prevalence of not being prescribed ART, and not being ART adherent than those who did not exchange sex. We identify several areas for intervention, including: provision of or referral to services for unmet needs (such as housing or shelter), enhanced delivery of mental health and substance abuse screening and treatment, risk-reduction counseling, and ART prescription and adherence support services.",2018,,AIDS Care,30,10,1315-1321,,10.1080/09540121.2018.1465174,,#3669,Olaiya 2018,,
Family history of psychosis and outcome of people with schizophrenia in rural China: 14-year follow-up study,"Ran, Mao-Sheng; Xiao, Yunyu; Zhao, Xinyi; Zhang, Tian-Ming; Yu, Yue-Hui; Mao, Wen-Jun; Lin, Fu-Rong; Liu, Bo; Chan, Cecilia Lai-Wan","OBJECTIVE: This study examined the differences in 14-year outcomes of persons with schizophrenia with and without family history of psychosis in a rural community in China.METHODS: All participants with schizophrenia (n=510) aged 15 years and older were identified in a 1994 epidemiological investigation of 123,572 people and followed up in 2004 and 2008 in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China.RESULTS: Individuals with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly younger age of first onset than those with negative family history of schizophrenia in 1994 and 2004. Compared with individuals with negative family history of schizophrenia, those with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly higher rate of homelessness and lower rate of death due to other reasons in 10-year (2004) and 14-year follow-up (2008). There were no significantly differences of mean scores on PANSS, SDSS and GAF in 2008 between positive and negative family history groups.CONCLUSIONS: The positive family history of schizophrenia is strongly related to younger age of onset, and may predict a poorer long-term outcome (e.g., higher rate of homelessness) in persons with schizophrenia in the rural community. The findings have implications for further studies on specific family-related mechanisms on clinical treatment and rehabilitation, as well as for planning and delivering of community-based mental health services.",2018,,Asian J Psychiatr,32,,14-19,,10.1016/j.ajp.2017.11.016,,#3672,Ran 2018,,
Factors associated with completion of alcohol detoxification in residential settings,"Mutter, Ryan; Ali, Mir M.","PURPOSE: Over 15 million Americans have alcohol use disorder (AUD). Detoxification often occurs before treatment and is, therefore, an important component of the alcohol treatment system. Detoxification in a residential setting is indicated for certain patient populations, who often have more severe cases. This analysis examines factors associated with completion of detoxification for patients with AUD in residential facilities.DATA AND METHODS: We analyzed the 2006-2014 Treatment Episode Data Set - Discharges (TEDS-D) using logistic regression to estimate the association of a number of patient demographic, treatment, and disorder characteristics with completion of residential alcohol detoxification.RESULTS: Social determinants of health were associated with detoxification completion. Patients who had a high school education or more and who were not homeless were more likely to complete detoxification. Referral from alcohol/drug care and other health care sources, school/work and community sources, and the criminal justice system had higher odds of completing detoxification. The odds of completing detoxification were lower for patients who began drinking at age 11 or younger, those with concurrent opioids, methamphetamine, or benzodiazepine abuse, and those with a co-occurring psychiatric condition.CONCLUSIONS: The factors this study identified as being associated with lower odds of detoxification completion could be used to identify patients who would benefit from greater support during detoxification, treatment, and continuing care.",2019,,J Subst Abuse Treat,98,,53-58,,10.1016/j.jsat.2018.12.009,,#3675,Mutter 2019,,
Racial and Ethnic Differences in Viral Suppression Among HIV-Positive Women in Care,"Nwangwu-Ike, Ndidi; Frazier, Emma L.; Crepaz, Nicole; Tie, Yunfeng; Sutton, Madeline Y.","BACKGROUND: Women with HIV diagnoses are less likely to be virally suppressed than men. Women of different racial/ethnic groups may be differentially affected by sociodemographic factors. We examined differences in viral suppression among women by race/ethnicity and associated variables to inform prevention interventions.METHODS: We used data from the 2010-2014 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project, a cross-sectional survey of HIV-positive adults in care. We limited analyses to black, Hispanic, and white women. We calculated weighted prevalences of recent viral suppression (undetectable or <200 copies/mL) and sustained viral suppression (consistent viral suppression during the past 12 months) among women by race/ethnicity. We computed adjusted prevalence differences (aPDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for viral suppression by racial/ethnic group, controlling for selected variables, including available social determinants of health variables.RESULTS: Among women, 62.9% were black, 19.8% Hispanic, and 17.3% white. Overall, 74.3% had recent viral suppression, and 62.3% had sustained viral suppression. Compared with white women (79.7%, CI: 77.2 to 82.2), black (72.5%, CI: 70.3 to 74.7; PD: 7.2) and Hispanic (75.4%, CI: 72.6 to 78.3; PD: 4.3) women were less likely to have recent viral suppression. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for antiretroviral therapy adherence, HIV disease stage, age, homelessness, and education, black-white aPDs remained significant for recent (aPD: 4.8, CI: 1.6 to 8.1) and sustained (aPD: 5.0, CI: 1.1 to 9.0) viral suppression.CONCLUSION: Viral suppression was suboptimal for all women, but more for black and Hispanic women.

"Resurgent Methamphetamine Use at Treatment Admission in the United States, 2008-2017","Jones, Christopher M.; Olsen, Emily O.; O'Donnell, Julie; Mustaquim, Desiree","Objectives. To evaluate trends and correlates of methamphetamine use in the United States.Methods. Data are from 15 747 334 drug-related treatment admissions among persons aged 12 years or older in the 2008-2017 Treatment Episode Data Set. We analyzed trends and used multivariable logistic regression.Results. Methamphetamine-related admissions increased from 15.1% of drug-related treatment admissions in 2008 to 23.6% in 2017. Increases occurred among nearly all demographic groups. Methamphetamine injection increased from 17.5% of admissions in 2008 to 28.4% in 2017. Among methamphetamine-related admissions, heroin use increased from 5.3% of admissions in 2008 to 23.6% in 2017. Characteristics associated with increased odds of reporting methamphetamine use at admission included female sex; admissions aged 35 to 44 years; admissions in the Midwest, South, and West; unemployment; not in labor force; living dependent; living homeless; and having a referral from criminal justice, a health care provider, or other community treatment source.Conclusions. Treatment admissions involving methamphetamine use increased significantly over the past decade and appear to be linked to the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States.

[Health status and support needs of low-income people admitted to supportive housing in urban areas of Japan: Research on new residents across several age groups],"Matoba, Yuki; Saito, Emiko","Objectives　The aim of this study is to report on the health status of residents in supportive housing in urban areas of Japan, and to explore the differences in health conditions across different age groups within this population.Methods　The participants were 341 residents who had newly been admitted to supportive housing managed by a nonprofit organization. We examined their admission records and documented their health conditions. Differences in health conditions across age groups were also explored.Results　More than 90 percent of the participants were single men, aged 40 or older, and living on welfare. The main reasons for their utilization of supportive housing were the lack of accommodation after leaving a hospital or facility, decrease in physical function, and progression of dementia. A high proportion of participants under 40 years had an addiction problem, schizophrenia, intellectual disorders, or developmental disorders. Participants aged 40-59 years had high rates of lifestyle-related diseases in addition to mental illnesses. Furthermore, for those aged 60 years and older, the prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as dementia, hearing impairment, and visual impairment was high. Additionally, there was a high proportion of elderly participants whose health status was unknown when they were admitted to supportive housing.Conclusion　Most residents who had been admitted to supportive housing in the urban areas of Japan had physical or mental illnesses, and their life and support needs varied by age group. These findings suggest that it may be necessary for residents living in urban supportive housing in Japan to receive not only increased medical and psychological care but also age group-specific care.",2019,,Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi,66,12,767-777,,10.11236/jph.66.12_767,,#3684,Matoba 2019,,

There is not sufficient evidence to estimate potential environmental risk factors for NMOSD; therefore, many predisposing factors may remain unknown.OBJECTIVE: The present study assessed the possible associations of ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and stressful life events with NMOSD risk after adjustment for sex and age in an Iranian population.METHODS: This population-based case-control study included NMOSD cases and healthy controls in Tehran, Iran. Diagnosis of disease was confirmed by neurologists based on the 2015 International Consensus Criteria (ICC). Controls were sex-matched with cases and had no history of any neurological disorders. The telephone interviews were administered to gather pertinent data. Matched logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using SPSS.RESULTS: This study recruited 153 NMOSD cases and 400 controls with the case-control ratio of 1: 2.61 and mean ages (SD) of 37.11 (10.90) and 33.67 (8.37) years, respectively (p < 0.001). Depression history (OR = 3.79; 95% CI (1.50 - 9.58), p = 0.01) and stressful life events including death of first-degree relatives (OR = 5.10; 95% CI (1.78 - 14.61), p < 0.01), family disruption (OR = 12.68; 95% CI) 3.53 - 45.46), p < 0.001), homelessness periods(OR = 4.35; 95% CI (1.18 - 14.74), p = 0.02), joblessness (OR = 4.24; 95% CI (1.91 - 5.15), p = 0.01), and divorce (OR = 14.18; 95% CI (1.91 - 23.15), p = 0.01) were more common among NMOSD cases than matched controls and may play a role in increasing risk of disease occurrence. Marriage (OR = 0.10; 95% CI (0.03 - 0.35), p < 0.001) and Conquer (Iranian national exam for university entrance) (OR = 0.31; 95% CI (0.11 - 0.88), p = 0.02) had a negative association with NMOSD risk. Other stressful life events including jail term, close family members' serious disease or suicide, death of spouse, being in debt, getting fired from work, migration, and retirement had no relation with NMOSD risk (P > 0.05). The total stress number and load were not significantly associated with the risk of NMOSD (P > 0.05). Self-rated health status was significantly higher in controls (p < 0.001). Socioeconomic status (SES), parental ethnicity, and parental educational level during subjects' adolescence were not among the significant predictors of NMOSD risk (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: No association was identified between ethnicity, SES, and parental educational levels as risk factors for developing NMOSD in an Iranian population. The obtained evidence showed the association of some individual stressful life events like death of first-degree relatives, family disruption, homelessness periods, joblessness, and divorce with the risk of developing NMOSD while marriage had a negative association. Depression history was more common among cases than healthy controls and may play a role in increasing risk of NMOSD.",2020,,Mult Scler Relat Disord,46,,102544,,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102544,,#3687,Rafiee 2020,,
Findings of a national dataset analysis on the visits of homeless patients to US emergency departments during 2005-2015,"Lombardi, K.; Pines, J. M.; Mazer-Amirshahi, M.; Pourmand, A.","OBJECTIVES: To our knowledge, there has been limited description of emergency department (ED) visits involving homeless patients over the last decade. Our study aims to analyze US national survey data to elucidate the differences between homeless and non-homeless patients' ED visits in terms of patient demographics, resource utilization, and diagnoses received.STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2005 until 2015.METHODS: Patient visits were classified as homeless or non-homeless based on survey data; appropriate statistical analyses were subsequently performed to compare these groups in terms of patient demographics, geography, payment method, resource utilization/diagnostic service use, as well as both psychiatric and non-psychiatric diagnoses received in the ED.RESULTS: NHAMCS data from 2005 to 2015 were aggregated. In total, 303,326 patient visits were included, which represent an estimated 1.30 billion ED visits over this period. Of these, 2750 encounters were by homeless people, representing 8,781,925 ED visits. Compared with non-homeless visits, homeless patients were disproportionately male, black, non-Hispanic, and seen in large metropolitan areas or the Western/Southern US. Homeless visits were more likely to be related to an injury (47.5% vs. 33.8%), related to an assault (4.2% vs. 1.3%), or self-inflicted (4.8% vs 0.84%). Homeless patients were also more likely to have been seen in the same ED within 72 h (7.3% vs. 3.9%) compared with non-homeless patients (3.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5-4.4) and were seen an average of 5.7 times (95% CI: 4.7-6.8) in the same ED over the preceding 12 months, with non-homeless patients seen an average of 3.2 times (95% CI: 3.1-3.4). Homeless patients were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (14.9% vs. 11.2%) and, when admitted, spent an average of 6.3 days in the hospital (95% CI: 5.6-7.1) compared with non-homeless patients at 5.2 (95% CI: 5.1-5.3). In total, 28.4% of homeless patients received a psychiatric diagnosis (95% CI: 25.8-31.2) compared with 5.4% for non-homeless patients (95% CI: 5.2-5.7, P < 0.001). In reference to non-homeless visits, homeless visits showed increased odds of alcohol-related diagnoses (odds ratio [OR]: 17.3, 95% CI: 10.1-29.8, P < 0.001) and substance abuse diagnoses (OR: 8.4, 95% CI: 7.2-9.8, P < 0.001). Homeless visits also exhibited greatly increased odds of diagnosis of schizophrenia (OR: 16.6, 95% CI: 12.6-22.5, P < 0.001) and personality disorders (OR: 15.4, 95% CI: 6.4-36.9, P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Less than one in 100 US ED visits in 2005-2015 were made by homeless patients. Compared with the non-homeless, homeless patients had greatly increased rates of ED care for alcohol-related, substance abuse-related, and mental health-related problems, particularly schizophrenia and personality disorders. Homeless patients were also more likely to be seen in the ED within the past 72 h or the past 12 months. Homeless patients were more likely to be admitted to the hospital and, when admitted, exhibited longer stay times.",2020,,Public Health,178,,82-89,,10.1016/j.puhe.2019.09.003,,#3690,Lombardi 2020,,
"Beyond the margins: antenatal health and healthcare behaviours among homeless women in Kolkata Municipal Corporation, India","Rahaman, Margubur; Das, Kailash Chandra","Despite high childbearing rates among homeless women in India, the antenatal health and healthcare behaviours among such population remain poorly understood. To address this research gap, a mixed-methods approach was employed in the present study, involving interviews with a sample of 400 women aged 15-49 years, utilising time and location sampling techniques. Additionally, a purposeful sample of 52 women from the same age group participated in in-depth interviews. The respondents exhibited rampant socio-economic backwardness, including chronic homelessness (36%), no formal education (54%), engagement in rag picking (31%), and low income levels. About 56% of the women reported poor self-rated health (SRH), notably higher among those aged 35 and above and those living alone (68%). Poor SRH was also prevalent among the ever married (61%), ragpickers (61%), beggars (62%), chronic homeless individuals (62%), tobacco (60%) and alcohol consumers (61%), and those with chronic diseases (61%). Common health issues included depression or anxiety (56%) and iron deficiency anaemia (35%). The level of unmet healthcare needs was 41%, with significant variation across diseases. Lack of reproductive health rights and awareness, socio-cultural beliefs, stigma, socio-economic poverty, poor quality of public healthcare services, irregularity in charity-run healthcare, and time constraints hindered antenatal care visits.

Epidemiological information was collected through community-based assessments and interviews. Thereafter, blood and fecal samples were collected and tested for HEV using an immunoenzymatic assay, and the genotype was identified by PCR. Logistic regressions were used to identify the risk factors independently associated with exposure to HEV. In total, 79 (18.1%) PWUCC were exposed to HEV: 73 (16.7%) for IgG and six for IgG + IgM. HEV RNA was detected in six fecal samples and in two blood samples from PWUCC with IgM + IgG. Subtype 3c was identified in all of the samples. The factors associated with exposure to HEV were low monthly income, unstable housing (e.g., homelessness), crack-cocaine use ≥40 months, and the shared use of crack-cocaine equipment. The current study provides unique initial insights into HEV status and risk factors among PWUCC in a remote area in Brazil, with diverse implications for urgently improved diagnosis, prevention, and treatment intervention needs.",2021,,Viruses,13,5,926,,10.3390/v13050926,,#3699,doNascimento 2021,,

"Transactional Sex, HIV, and Bacterial STIs Among U.S. Men Who have Sex with Men","Atkins, Kaitlyn; Wiginton, John M.; Carpino, Thomas; Sanchez, Travis H.; Murray, Sarah M.; Baral, Stefan D.","INTRODUCTION: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and are engaged in transactional sex (MSM-TS) experience complex social and structural vulnerabilities that increase their HIV risk. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of TS and associations between TS and sexually transmitted infection (STI) outcomes among cisgender MSM in the U.S.METHODS: Using 2017-2021 data from an online survey of U.S. MSM, characteristics of MSM-TS were summarized, and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) calculated for the associations between past-year TS and bacterial STI diagnosis, HIV status, and either antiretroviral or pre-exposure prophylaxis use. Analyses were conducted in 2023.RESULTS: TS prevalence was 3.7% (n=1,848/49,539). Compared to other MSM, MSM-TS more commonly reported homelessness, being uninsured, condomless anal sex with partners of any HIV status and condomless anal sex with serodifferent partners, and illicit drug use. TS was associated with increased HIV (aPR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25-1.66) and bacterial STI prevalence (aPR 2.40, 95% CI=2.09-2.52) and lower antiretroviral therapy use (among MSM living with HIV; PR 0.92, 95% CI=0.87-0.97).CONCLUSIONS: Structural and behavioral risks converged among U.S. MSM engaging in TS leading to greater HIV and bacterial STI prevalence in this group. HIV interventions for U.S. MSM-TS should address individual as well as structural risks, including poverty and housing instability.",2024,,Am J Prev Med,67,5,722-729,,10.1016/j.amepre.2024.07.002,,#3705,Atkins 2024,,

Two new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) and 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20), were recently approved for use in US adults. We describe the epidemiology of IPD among Alaska adults and estimate the proportion of IPD cases potentially preventable by new vaccines.METHODS: We used statewide, laboratory-based surveillance data to calculate and compare IPD incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) among Alaska adults aged ≥18 years during 2011-2020 and estimate the proportion of IPD cases that were caused by serotypes in PCV15 and PCV20.RESULTS: During 2011-2020, 1164 IPD cases were reported among Alaska adults for an average annual incidence of 21.3 cases per 100 000 adults per year (95% CI, 20.1-22.5). Incidence increased significantly during the study period (P < .01). IPD incidence among Alaska Native adults was 4.7 times higher than among non-Alaska Native adults (95% CI, 4.2-5.2). Among adults experiencing homelessness in Anchorage, IPD incidence was 72 times higher than in the general adult population (95% CI, 59-89). Overall, 1032 (89%) Alaska adults with IPD had an indication for pneumococcal vaccine according to updated vaccination guidelines; 456 (39%) and 700 (60%) cases were caused by serotypes in PCV15 and PCV20, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Use of PCV15 and PCV20 could substantially reduce IPD among adults in Alaska, including Alaska Native adults and adults experiencing homelessness.",2024,,Clin Infect Dis,78,1,172-178,,10.1093/cid/ciad597,,#3708,Steinberg 2024,,

To compare the incidence, case-hospitalization rates, and vaccination rates of COVID-19 between people experiencing sheltered homelessness (PESH) and the broader community in Chicago, Illinois, and describe the impact of a whole community approach to disease mitigation during the public health emergency. Methods. Incidence of COVID-19 among PESH was compared with community-wide incidence using case-based surveillance data from March 1, 2020, to May 11, 2023. Seven-day rolling means of COVID-19 incidence were assessed for the overall study period and for each of 6 distinct waves of COVID-19 transmission. Results. A total of 774 009 cases of COVID-19 were detected: 2579 among PESH and 771 430 in the broader community. Incidence and hospitalization rates per 100 000 in PESH were more than 5 times higher (99.84 vs 13.94 and 16.88 vs 2.14) than the community at large in wave 1 (March 1, 2020-October 3, 2020). This difference decreased through wave 3 (March 7, 2021-June 26, 2021), with PESH having a lower incidence rate per 100 000 than the wider community (8.02 vs 13.03). Incidence and hospitalization of PESH rose again to rates higher than the broader community in waves 4 through 6 but never returned to wave 1 levels. Throughout the study period, COVID-19 incidence among PESH was 2.88 times higher than that of the community (70.90 vs 24.65), and hospitalization was 4.56 times higher among PESH (7.51 vs 1.65). Conclusions. Our findings suggest that whole-community approaches can minimize disparities in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission between vulnerable populations and the broader community, and reinforce the benefits of a shared approach that include multiple partners when addressing public health emergencies in special populations.

"Empowering 'Ōpio (Next Generation): Student Centered, Community Engaged, School Based Health Education","Garcia, Blane K.; Agustin, Malia L.; Okihiro, May M.; Sehgal, Vija M.","Education and health are vital for children to thrive, especially for those from rural and disparate communities. For Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of the State of Hawai'i, lokahi (balance) frames the concept of ola (health), consisting of physical, emotional, and spiritual health. The foundation of ola is embedded in the cultural values - kupuna (ancestors), 'āina (land), environment, and 'ohana (family). Unfortunately, since westernization, Native Hawaiians have significant health disparities that begin in early childhood and often continue throughout their lifetime. Native Hawaiians also have a history of educational disparities, such as lower high school an college graduation rates compared to other ethnic groups. Social and economic determinants, such as poverty, homelessness, and drug addiction, often contribute to these educational disparities. In rural O'ahu, the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center recently established two school-based health centers at the community's high and intermediate schools to improve student access to comprehensive health services. Recognizing the need to improve student health literacy and address specific health issues impacting the community and students, two health educators were added to the school-based health team. This article describes: 1) the initial steps taken by the health educators to engage and empower students as a means to assess their needs, interests and facilitate student lokahi, ola, and wellness and; 2) the results of this initial needs assessment.",2019,,Hawaii J Health Soc Welf,78,12 Suppl 3,30-34,,,,#3714,Garcia 2019,,

Emergency Department Visits in a Cohort of Persons with Substance Use: Incorporating the Role of Social Networks,"Sacamano, Paul; Krawczyk, Noa; Latkin, Carl","BACKGROUND: Frequent emergency department (ED) visits often suggest inappropriate use for low acuity needs and multiple comorbidities, including substance use disorders.OBJECTIVE: This study examines associations of individuals and their social networks with high frequency ED use among persons reporting substance use.METHODS: Information was obtained from interview responses from the first 6-month follow-up visit of a longitudinal. Prevalence ratios for the outcome of high frequency ED visits (≥2 in 6 months) were determined with a generalized linear model, log link, Poisson distribution and robust standard errors.RESULTS: Of 653 participants, 131 (20%) had ≥2 ED visits. In multivariable analysis, greater likelihood of high frequency ED visits over 6 months was associated with being homeless (PR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.10), taking ≥3 medications (PR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.10) and having had a hospitalization over the same period (PR: 4.33; 95% CI: 3.26, 7.56).

"Homelessness, psychiatric disorders, and violence in Denmark: a population-based cohort study","Nilsson, Sandra Feodor; Laursen, Thomas Munk; Andersen, Lars Højsgaard; Nordentoft, Merete; Fazel, Seena","BACKGROUND: Homelessness is associated with adverse health and social outcomes. People experiencing homelessness have been found to have a high risk of violent crime victimisation as well as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. It is poorly understood whether experiencing homelessness is associated with additional risks of violent offending and whether psychiatric disorders contribute to these risks. We examined the association between homelessness, psychiatric disorders, and first violence offence leading to conviction.METHODS: We did a nationwide, register-based cohort study of all Danish residents who were alive at least 1 day during the study period, born between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2006, and aged 15 years or older retrieved from the Danish Civil Registration System, which was linked to registers with information on homelessness, health care, and criminality. The exposure was any experience of homelessness, which was defined as having at least one contact with a homeless shelter during the study period. The outcome was first violent offence leading to a conviction. We calculated incidence rates per 10 000 person-years, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using Poisson regression analysis, and probability of conviction of a violent offence using an Aalen-Johansen estimator. Analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted for calendar year of the study period, age, other sociodemographic factors, and psychiatric disorders.FINDINGS: The study cohort included 1 786 433 Danish residents aged 15-42 years living in Denmark at some point from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2021, contributing to 21 336 322 person-years at risk, of whom 57 084 (3·2%) individuals had their first violent offence leading to conviction during follow-up. 10 years after their first contact with a homeless shelter, 22·9% (95% CI 21·6-24·2) of men and 7·7% (6·8-8·7) of women had committed at least one violent crime leading to conviction. The fully adjusted IRRs of a violent offence leading to conviction were 4·8 (4·5-5·1) in men and 6·3 (5·6-7·2) in women experiencing homelessness compared with individuals who had not experienced homelessness. The IRR for a violent offence leading to conviction was highest in individuals experiencing homelessness and having co-occurring psychiatric disorders compared with those not experiencing homelessness and without co-occurring psychiatric disorders, especially drug use disorders (IRR in those experiencing homelessness and having a drug use disorder: 15·3 [14·1-16·7] in men and 40·1 [33·9-47·5] in women compared with individuals not experiencing homelessness and having no drug use disorder).INTERPRETATION: Individuals experiencing homelessness had higher risks of a violent offence leading to conviction than those who had not experienced homelessness. In addition to preventing homelessness, public health and policy should consider how to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in people experiencing homelessness.FUNDING: Lundbeck Foundation.",2024,,Lancet Public Health,9,6,e376-e385,,10.1016/S2468-2667(24)00096-3,,#3726,Nilsson 2024,,
Antipsychotic Medication Prescriptions for Homeless and Unstably Housed Veterans in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System,"Tsai, Jack; Szymkowiak, Dorota; Radhakrishnan, Rajiv","OBJECTIVE: Many homeless and unstably housed (HUH) adults have severe mental illnesses that are managed with antipsychotic medications. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest provider of homeless services, but there has been little study of psychotropic medication prescriptions for HUH veterans.METHODS: Using national VA administrative data in 2017, rates and characteristics associated with prescriptions for antipsychotic medications for veterans using VA health care services (N = 2,882,993), including HUH veterans (n = 266,855), were analyzed.RESULTS: Among HUH veterans, 17.6% had an antipsychotic prescription within 1 year of indication of HUH and 4.3% had prescriptions for 3 or more antipsychotic medications, which was higher than the 2.2% of non-HUH veterans with 3 or more antipsychotic prescriptions. Controlling for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, HUH veterans were more than 3 times as likely to have an antipsychotic prescription as other veterans. However, among HUH veterans with an ICD-10-documented psychotic or bipolar disorder, HUH veterans were less likely to have prescriptions for first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics compared to their non-HUH counterparts (odds ratios for any antipsychotic < 0.5). Less than 2% of both HUH and non-HUH veterans had received long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotic medications, and less than 0.2% were on clozapine treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a snapshot of antipsychotic prescription practices for HUH veterans in the VA health care system. The higher rates of antipsychotic prescriptions for HUH veterans overall, but potential underprescribing of antipsychotics for HUH veterans with severe mental illness, suggest there are opportunities for improving antipsychotic prescription practices in this population, including increasing use of long-acting injectable medications.",2020,,J Clin Psychiatry,82,1,20m13372,,10.4088/JCP.20m13372,,#3729,Tsai 2020,,
Burden and Risk Factors for Cold-Related Illness and Death in New York City,"Lane, Kathryn; Ito, Kazuhiko; Johnson, Sarah; Gibson, Elizabeth A.; Tang, Andrew; Matte, Thomas","Exposure to cold weather can cause cold-related illness and death, which are preventable.

On average each year, there were 180 treat-and-release emergency department visits (average annual rate of 21.6 per million) and 240 hospital admissions (29.6 per million) for cold-related illness, and 15 cold-related deaths (1.8 per million). Seventy-five percent of decedents were exposed outdoors. About half of those exposed outdoors were homeless or suspected to be homeless. Of the 25% of decedents exposed indoors, none had home heat and nearly all were living in single-family or row homes. The majority of deaths and illnesses occurred outside of periods of extreme cold. Unsheltered homeless individuals, people who use substances and become incapacitated outdoors, and older adults with medical and psychiatric conditions without home heat are most at risk.

K.; Munjattu, Joseph Francis","BACKGROUND: Provision of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) and Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) are important components of the targeted intervention (TI) programme for people who inject drugs (PWID). Homeless HIV positive PWIDs in Delhi is a key population experiencing gaps in uptake of these services, especially the ART uptake which is reportedly far from 90%, UNAIDS' 90-90-90 target to end the AIDS epidemic.OBJECTIVE: To assess the gaps and barriers in accessing the ART and OST services uptake among HIV positive homeless PWID in Delhi and to explore experiences and perspectives of the PWIDs and service providers.METHODOLOGY: We used a convergent parallel mixed methods design which included a cross-sectional quantitative survey and a qualitative study. Two hundred thirty five homeless HIV positive PWID were interviewed and in-depth interviews were conducted with five PWIDs and nine health providers.RESULTS: While only 12% of PWIDs were on ART, 80% were availing OST services. The top individual, health system related and structural barriers for ART service access were insufficient and incorrect knowledge (63%), long waiting time (86%) and lack of family support (44%) respectively. Inconvenient timings, stringent registration requirements and negative attitude of health providers were expressed as major barriers of accessing ART services during the interviews while these were not a concern in OST services. Homelessness, poverty, stigma were common barriers for both services. Integrated, 'single window' service and provision of additional support like nutrition and shelter were suggested as measures to improve access by both health providers and the PWIDs themselves.CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for structural and health systems changes to improve access to ART and OST services. These include integrated service delivery, flexibility in timing of the centers, accelerated ART initiation, simplification of bureaucratic procedures, nutritional and social support to all homeless HIV positive PWIDs.",2018,,PLoS One,13,8,e0203262,,10.1371/journal.pone.0203262,,#3735,Kumar 2018,,
Predictors of hepatitis A immunity in adults in California in order to better utilize hepatitis A vaccine,"Lewin, Bruno J.; Rodriguez, Janelle; Yang, Su-Jau; Tartof, Sara Y.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A vaccine recommendations now include homelessness, illegal drug use, and HIV, as well as traditional risk factors and travel to areas endemic for hepatitis A. We examined a large diverse population for predictors of Hepatitis A immunity in order to better utilize Hepatitis A vaccine.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study of members of a large integrated health plan with a test for Hepatitis A Immunoglobulin G (IgG) between January 1st, 2007, and December 31st, 2017. Exclusion criteria included age <18 years, <6 months of continuous enrollment, and Hepatitis A vaccine prior to Hepatitis A test. Variables of interest were age, gender, primary language spoken, ethnicity/race, neighborhood household income, and history of travel or history of jaundice. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of risk factors on Hepatitis A immunity.RESULTS: Of the 318,170 persons ≥ 18 years tested for Hepatitis A immunity, 155, 842 persons had a reactive Hepatitis A IgG test (49%). The lowest prevalence was for Whites at 28.1% followed by Blacks at 35.8%. Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders had prevalence rates of 63% and 68.2% respectively.

Increased demand for amphetamine treatment in rural Australia,"Allan, Julaine; Ip, Ryan H. L.; Kemp, Michael; Snowdon, Nicole","BACKGROUND: A substantial increase in substance treatment episodes for methamphetamine problems suggests characteristics of the treatment population could have changed and that targeted treatment programs are required. To determine who methamphetamine treatment should be designed for this study has two aims. First, to empirically describe changes in amphetamine treatment presentations to a rural NSW drug and alcohol treatment agency over time. Second, to examine how these characteristics may affect the likelihood of being treated for amphetamines compared to other drugs.METHOD: The Australian Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services National Minimum Data Set (AODTS-NMDS) containing closed treatment episodes from a single agency from three time periods was used. Characteristics of people receiving amphetamine treatments in these three periods were compared and the effects of these characteristics on the odds of being treated for amphetamine were estimated using a logistic regression model. The characteristics utilised in the analysis include age, sex, Indigenous status, usual accommodation, living arrangement, source of referral and source of income.RESULTS: The proportion of amphetamine treatment episodes doubled from 2006/2007 to 2015/2016 and overtook alcohol as the most commonly treated principal drug of concern. The estimated proportion of amphetamine treatments showed an increment across all ages and for men and women. It was found that younger people, women, people in temporary accommodation or homeless, people who were self-referred and people whose main source of income was not through employment are more likely to be treated for amphetamine use.CONCLUSION: Significant changes over time in the age, sex and Indigenous status of people receiving treatment for amphetamine as the principal drug of concern requires service delivery to match demand from younger people, particularly women; and Indigenous people. The needs and preferences for treatment of younger women who use amphetamine will be important factors in treatment planning service providers who are more used to providing treatment for young men who use cannabis and older men who use alcohol. Further research on women's experiences in treatment and outcomes would be useful for informing treatment practices.",2019,,Addict Sci Clin Pract,14,1,13,,10.1186/s13722-019-0144-6,,#3744,Allan 2019,,
Social impairment and stigma in genetic generalized epilepsies,"Gabriel, Denis; Ventura, Magda; Samões, Raquel; Freitas, Joel; Lopes, João; Ramalheira, João; Martins da Silva, António; Chaves, João","INTRODUCTION: Patients with epilepsy have poor social outcome. Multifactorial factors are usually involved, but among them, stigma features may have an important role. Genetic generalized epilepsies (GGEs) were previously considered ""benign"" syndromes. The aim of our study was to assess social impairment and stigma in GGE and to evaluate differences between the following GGE subsyndromes: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCSA). Additionally, we compared these outcomes with outcomes from a cohort of patients with epilepsy with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), a severe and difficult-to-treat syndrome. Results were compared with social data from the general population.METHODS: Adult patients with epilepsy with a previously classified GGE or MTLE-HS were consecutively invited to fill in a sociodemographic and stigma questionnaire in outpatient clinic. Clinical data and psychiatric comorbidities were retrieved from clinical notes.RESULTS: Questionnaires from 333 patients were obtained: 226/67% from patients with GGE (JME: 106/31.8%, GTCSA: 74/22.2%, and JAE: 46/13.8%) and 107/32.1% from patients with MTLE-HS. We found that patients with GGE have a good academic achievement but they have increased difficulties in finding a partner, higher rates of divorce, and a reduced number of children per woman and per man when compared with general population. We also observed that patients with GGE have higher rates of unemployment (22.6%) and lower monthly income than general population. Severe problems in housing were only seen in GGEs. Of these, 3 patients (1.3%) were in homeless condition. Over half (52%) of patients with MTLE-HS and over a quarter (28%) of patients with GGE experienced felt stigma. Psychiatric comorbidity was highly prevalent among GGE (34.1%), especially in patients with refractory epilepsy. Mood and anxiety disorders were the most prevalent conditions. No other significant differences were found between GGE subsyndromes.DISCUSSION: We found an impairment in every social domain assessed (except in level of education) when compared with general population. Most of the social outcome parameters were unexpectedly close or similar to MTLE-HS or even worse as it was the prevalence of homelessness among GGE. Social impairment is underdiagnosed and might be considered in clinical practice even in syndromes for some time considered benign such as GGE.",2020,,Epilepsy Behav,104,Pt A,106886,,10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.106886,,#3747,Gabriel 2020,,
Stressful life events and the risk of primary progressive multiple sclerosis: A population-based case-control study,"Alsharie, Alimohammad Mohtasham; Rafiee, Farnaz; Rezaeimanesh, Nasim; Moghadasi, Abdorreza Naser; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Eskandarieh, Sharareh","BACKGROUND: The onset and presentation of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) like any other autoimmune diseases can be triggered by unexpected lifetime stressful events, which require to be assessed in order to minimize our exposure to such events as much as possible.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the possible role of socioeconomic status (SES) and stressful events in PPMS development METHODS: The present population-based case-control study recruited PPMS cases and healthy controls from the general population during 2019-2020 in Tehran, Iran. Clinical diagnosis of cases was based on the 2017 McDonald criteria and confirmed by a neurologist. The selection of sex-matched controls from the same source population of cases was performed using the standard method of Random Digit Dialing (RDD). The study questionnaire was filled out over telephone interviews. Matched logistic regression was administered to estimate the adjusted and unadjusted odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for sex, age, and marital status using SPSS 23.RESULTS: This study examined 146 PPMS cases and 294 controls. Mean ages (SD) for cases and controls were 46.97 (9.4) and 37.67 (6.12), respectively (P < 0.001). No stressful events over five years prior to the disease onset were associated with an increased risk of PPMS. Marriage (OR: 0.04; 95% CI (0.01- 0.37), P = 0.004), close family members' serious disease (OR: 0.10; 95% CI (0.02-0.60), P = 0.01), and being in debt (OR: 0.03; 95% CI (0-0.37), P = 0.006) were found to have a negative association with the risk of disease occurrence. Death of a loved one, family disruption, jail term, homelessness period, Conquer(national university entrance exam), death of spouse, getting fired from a job, joblessness, divorce, migration, close family members' suicide, and retirement were not associated with the risk of PPMS (P > 0.05). History of depression before the PPMS presentation was considerably associated with the incidence of PPMS (P < 0.001). Self-rated health status was scored noticeably lower by cases as compared with controls (P < 0.001). Participants with the paternal educational degree of guidance school showed a higher risk of PPMS by 2.83 time (OR: 2.83; 95% CI (1.02 - 7.80), P = 0.04) than participants with university educated fathers. In total, SES during adolescence did not indicate any association with the risk of PPMS (with the exception of levels 2 (P = 0.02) and 7 (P = 0.05)).CONCLUSION: No stressful life events were identified as possible increasing risk factors for PPMS. Marriage, close family members' serious disease, and being in debt had a negative association with the disease risk. The history of depression may elevate the risk of PPMS. While the highest and lowest SES levels in adolescence were not remarkable determiners for PPMS, levels 2 and 7 had a positive association with the risk of PPMS. The maternal educational level was not an important factor; however, the paternal educational degree of guidance school as compared to university degree made individuals more susceptible to PPMS. Self-rated health status score was higher in controls.",2021,,Mult Scler Relat Disord,51,,102937,,10.1016/j.msard.2021.102937,,#3750,Alsharie 2021,,
"""Like an umbrella, protecting me from the rain until I get to my destination"": Evaluating the implementation of a tailored primary care model for urban marginalized populations","Khorsand, Soha; Geller, Carol; Eyre, Alison; Abi Haidar, Hounaida; Chen, Haifeng; Lacombe, Corina; Kabir, Monisha; Mclellan, Andrew","BACKGROUND: Improving health equity and access to the highest possible standard of health care is a key issue of social accountability. Centretown Community Health Centre in Ottawa, Canada has iteratively developed a program to target and serve marginalized and complex populations since 1999. The program implementation was evaluated using a validated implementation framework.METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a health records extraction (n = 570), a client complexity assessment tool (n = 74), semi-structured interviews with clients and key stakeholders (n = 41), and a structured client satisfaction survey (n = 30). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis.RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy unique clients were seen between November 1-30, 2021. A third of clients (34%) did not have a provincial health card for access to universal health care services, and most (68%) were homeless or a resident of rooming houses. Most clients who reported their income (92%) were at or below Canada's official poverty line. The total mean complexity score for clients seen over a one-month period (n = 74) was 16.68 (SD 6.75) where a total score of at least 13 of 33 is perceived to be a threshold for client biopsychosocial complexity. Clients gained the majority of their total score from the Social support assessment component of the tool. Clients (n = 31) and key informants (n = 10) highlighted the importance of building relationships with this population, providing wrap-around care, and providing low-barrier care as major strength to the Urban Health program (UH). Key areas for improvement included the need to: i) increase staff diversity, ii) expand program hours and availability, and iii) improve access to harm reduction services. Clients appeared to be highly satisfied with the program, rating the program an average total score of 18.50 out of 20.CONCLUSIONS: The program appears to serve marginalized and complex clients and seems well-received by the community. Our findings have relevance for other health care organizations seeking to better serve marginalized and medically and socially complex individuals and families in their communities.",2024,,BMC Prim Care,25,1,347,,10.1186/s12875-024-02563-6,,#3753,Khorsand 2024,,
Factors associated with health services financier among temporary sheltered homeless in urban Malaysia,"Aizuddin, Azimatun Noor; Abdul Jabar, Siti Waffa; Idris, Idayu Badila","BACKGROUND: The presence of homelessness in Malaysia is not a new issue. The existence of homeless population is growing, along with the development of this country. With the increasing number of homelessness, the range of issues, such as health services financier among them, has surfaced. However, there was limited study conducted on this subject. The main objective of this study was thus, to identify the financier of health services among the homelessness in Kuala Lumpur and factors associated with it.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we include 196 homeless people aged above 18 years, Malaysian who were able to communicate with interviewers, and respondents who were not aggressive. These respondents were transits at Pusat Transit Gelandangan Kuala Lumpur and Anjung Singgah Kuala Lumpur and were available during interview sessions. They were selected via simple random sampling and were interviewed via face to face guided interviews using a validated structured questionnaire. Data were analysed descriptively, as well as using bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore the associated factors.RESULTS: The study showed that 57.7% homeless utilized the health services with only 37.8% assessed government health services. Only 42.5% of the respondents use their own money and 46.9% received aids to finance their health. Major influencing factors that influence homeless people to use their own money for health services were education level, income and disability, with adjusted OR (95% CI) of 3.15 (1.07-9.25), 0.08 (0.029-3.07) and 0.05 (0.003-0.88) while p value was 0.037, < 0.001 and 0.041 respectively. The influencing factors for receiving aid for health services were income and those who took drugs with adjusted OR (95% CI) of 6.50 (2.30-18.39), and 0.33 (0.11-0.95) while p value was < 0.001 and 0.041 respectively.CONCLUSION: There is low healthcare services utilization and affordability among homelessness. All parties should play a role in ensuring that homeless people are not left behind in the health care accessibility in Malaysia.",2019,,BMC Public Health,19,Suppl 4,548,,10.1186/s12889-019-6871-5,,#3756,Aizuddin 2019,,
"Prevalence and correlates of transactional sex among women of low socioeconomic status in Portland, OR","Menza, Timothy W.; Lipira, Lauren; Bhattarai, Amisha; Leon, Victoria Cali-De; Orellana, E. Roberto","BACKGROUND: Women who report transactional sex are at increased risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, in the United States, social, behavioral, and trauma-related vulnerabilities associated with transactional sex are understudied and data on access to biomedical HIV prevention among women who report transactional sex are limited.METHODS: In 2016, we conducted a population-based, cross-sectional survey of women of low socioeconomic status recruited via respondent-driven sampling in Portland, Oregon. We calculated the prevalence and, assessed the correlates of, transactional sex using generalized linear models accounting for sampling design. We also compared health outcomes, HIV screening, and knowledge and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) between women who did and did not report transactional sex.RESULTS: Of 334 women, 13.6% reported transactional sex (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8, 20.5%). Women who reported transactional sex were older, more likely to identify as black, to identify as lesbian or bisexual, to experience childhood trauma and recent sexual violence, and to have been homeless. Six percent (95% CI: 1.8, 10.5%) of women with no adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) reported transactional sex compared to 23.8% (95% CI: 13.0, 34.6%) of women who reported eleven ACEs (P <  0.001). Transactional sex was strongly associated with combination methamphetamine and opiate use as well as condomless sex. Women who reported transactional sex were more likely to report being diagnosed with a bacterial STI and hepatitis C; however, HIV screening and pre-exposure prophylaxis knowledge and use were low.CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of women of low socioeconomic status in Portland, Oregon, transactional sex was characterized by marginalized identities, homelessness, childhood trauma, sexual violence, substance use, and sexual vulnerability to HIV/STI. Multi-level interventions that address these social, behavioral, and trauma-related factors and increase access to biomedical HIV prevention are critical to the sexual health of women who engage in transactional sex.",2020,,BMC Womens Health,20,1,219,,10.1186/s12905-020-01088-1,,#3759,Menza 2020,,
Adults with Housing Insecurity Have Worse Access to Primary and Preventive Care,"Martin, Patricia; Liaw, Winston; Bazemore, Andrew; Jetty, Anuradha; Petterson, Stephen; Kushel, Margot","OBJECTIVE: Housing insecurity has been linked to high-risk behaviors and chronic disease, although less is known about the pathways leading to poor health. We sought to determine whether housing insecurity is associated with access to preventive and primary care.METHODS: We conducted weighted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses by using 2011 to 2015 Behavioral Risk factor Surveillance Survey data (N = 228,131 adults). The independent variable was housing insecurity derived from the question on worry about paying rent or mortgage. The outcome measures were health services utilization (no usual source of care, no routine checkup in the past 1 year, and delayed medical care due to cost), self-rated health (number of days reported physical, mental health not good, and poor overall health), and number of chronic diseases (0, 1, 2 or more). The covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, level of education, marital status, and number of children in the family. We also adjusted for state fixed effects and survey year. We performed χ2 tests and binary logistic regressions on categorical variables and ran t tests and estimated linear regression models on continuous variables. Multinomial logistic regressions were estimated for the number of chronic diseases.RESULTS: Of the 228,131 adults in the study sample, 28,704 adults reported housing insecurity. We found that those with housing insecurity were more likely to forgo routine check-ups and lack usual sources of care. Low-income individuals, minorities, the unmarried, and middle-aged adults were more likely to report housing insecurity.CONCLUSION: Housing insecurity is associated with worse access to preventive and primary care. Interventions to enhance access for these patients should be developed and studied.",2019,,J Am Board Fam Med,32,4,521-530,,10.3122/jabfm.2019.04.180374,,#3762,Martin 2019,,

Participants were recruited using the respondent-driven sampling (RDS) technique. The outcome of interest is the self-reported experience of sexual violence throughout the respondents' lifetime. We evaluated the actions taken by victims of sexual violence and how they dealt with the experience. Logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the associations between sociodemographic and behavioral factors (such as race, income, drug use, sex work, and access to healthcare) and the outcome.RESULTS: A total of 1,317 TGW were interviewed. Among them, 53% (n=698) reported experiencing sexual violence. For 64.4% (n=419) of the respondents, sexual violence occurred on more than one occasion. The majority of TGW did not seek health services (93.2%, n=648), disclose the violence (93.9%, n=653), nor seek support from family or friends (86.5%, n=601). A higher prevalence of sexual violence was associated with homelessness (adjusted prevalence ratio - aPR=1.69, 95% confidence interval - 95%CI 1.01-2.84), a history of engaging in sex work (aPR=2.04, 95%CI 1.46-2.85), self-reporting regular, bad, or very bad emotional health (aPR=1.67, 95%CI 1.28-2.19), and experiencing difficulties accessing health services in the previous year (aPR=2.78, 95%CI 1.74-4.43).CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of sexual violence, analyzed together with the actions of the victims, indicates a context of high vulnerability and low institutional support.

Predicting homelessness among individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders using local treatment records,"Moxley, Victor B. A.; Hoj, Taylor H.; Novilla, M. Lelinneth B.","One in five homeless people in the United States has a substance use and/or a mental health disorder. Substance use disorders substantially impact the ability to obtain and retain appropriate housing. Professionals who provide substance use treatment are typically required to provide housing assistance by prioritizing clients according to their risk for becoming or remaining homeless; however, existing methods for prioritizing clients can be time-consuming and staff- and training-intensive. This study analyzed the potential use of variables from locally collected and readily available treatment admission records to prioritize clients needing housing assistance. This study analyzed county-level substance use treatment admission and discharge records of 1862 treatment episodes for 1642 clients in publicly funded treatment programs in Utah County, Utah. For at least one admission or discharge, 185 clients lived on the streets or in a homeless shelter. Approximately 55% of treatment episodes that ended in homelessness at discharge did not originally begin with clients being homeless, suggesting a gap in prioritizing individuals for housing assistance. Logistic regression showed statistically significant associations between eventually becoming homeless at the time of discharge and being originally homeless on admission; older age (45 years or older); methamphetamine as primary drug used; and a diagnosis of axis I/II psychiatric disorder besides substance use disorder. These findings suggest that local and routinely collected substance use treatment records may be predictive of homelessness and potentially useful in prioritizing clients for housing assistance.",2020,,Addict Behav,102,,106160,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106160,,#3768,Moxley 2020,,

"Duration of homelessness and its relationship to use of hospital and emergency department services in Helsinki, Finland","Stenius-Ayoade, Agnes; Eriksson, Johan G.; Kautiainen, Hannu; Gissler, Mika; Haaramo, Peija","Aims: Homelessness is associated with poor health outcomes and increased use of hospital and emergency department (ED) services. Little is known about the duration of homelessness in relation to health care service use. The aim of this study was to examine the use of hospital and ED services among the homeless in Helsinki, Finland, and for the first time, to examine the relationship between service use and duration of homelessness. Methods: Six hundred and eighty-three persons staying at least one night in a shelter between September 2009 and September 2010 were followed until the end of 2014. Using negative binominal regression analysis we calculated the use of hospital and ED services and compared the use with that of a matched control group (N = 1361). We also analyzed service use in relation to the time spent homeless during follow-up. Results: The mean time spent homeless during the follow-up was 8.5 months, one third was temporarily homeless (less than 2% of the follow-up time), but recurrent episodes of homelessness were also common. The study group's incidence rate ratios for medical-surgical hospital days was 6.23 (95% CI: 4.73 to 8.21), for psychiatric hospital days 43.11 (95% CI: 23.02 to 80.74) and for ED visits 10.21 (95% CI: 8.77 to 11.90), compared with controls.

Comparative treatment of homeless persons with an infectious disease in the US emergency department setting: a retrospective approach,"Barnes, Jessica; Segars, Larry; Wasserman, Jason Adam; Karabon, Patrick; Taylor, Tracey A. H.","BACKGROUND: Research has long documented the increased emergency department usage by persons who are homeless compared with their housed counterparts, as well as an increased prevalence of infectious diseases. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the comparative treatment that persons who are homeless receive. This study seeks to describe this potential difference in treatment, including diagnostic services tested, procedures performed and medications prescribed.METHODS: This study used a retrospective, cohort study design to analyse data from the 2007-2010 United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey database, specifically looking at the emergency department subset. Complex sample logistic regression analysis was used to compare variables, including diagnostic services, procedures and medication classes prescribed between homeless and private residence individuals seeking emergency department treatment for infectious diseases. Findings were then adjusted for potential confounding variables.RESULTS: Compared with private residence individuals, persons who are homeless and presenting with an infectious disease were more likely (adjusted OR: 10.99, CI 1.08 to 111.40, p<0.05) to receive sutures or staples and less likely (adjusted OR: 0.29, CI 0.10 to 0.87, p<0.05) to be provided medications when presenting with an infectious disease in US emergency departments. Significant differences were also detected in prescribing habits of multiple anti-infective medication classes.CONCLUSION: This study detected a significant difference in suturing/stapling and medication prescribing patterns for persons who are homeless with an infectious disease in US emergency departments.

Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used to investigate factors associated with potentially unfavourable treatment outcome. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation.ResultsA total of 22,526 cases were analysed for treatment outcome. Information available on treatment outcome increased between 2008 (60%) and 2014 (71%) (p < 0.001). During this period, 74.1% of cases completed treatment, increasing from 73.0% in 2008 to 76.9% in 2014 (p < 0.001). This proportion was 74.0% in culture-positive pulmonary cases. Overall, 19.8% of cases had a potentially unfavourable outcome, including lost-to-follow-up, transferred out, still on treatment, death related to TB and interrupted treatment. Potentially unfavourable outcome was significantly associated with TB severity, residing in congregate settings, homelessness, being a smear-positive pulmonary case, being born abroad and residing in France for < 2 years, history of previous anti-TB treatment and age > 85 years.ConclusionMonitoring of treatment outcome is improving over time.

However, there is a risk that high-level vaccination coverage statistics may mask hidden inequalities in under-served populations, many of whom may be at increased risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The study population included 1,436,229 individuals aged 18 years and over, alive and residence in Wales as at 31st July 2022, and excluded immunosuppressed or care home residents. We compared people who had received one or more vaccinations to those with no vaccination using linked data from nine datasets within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. Multivariable analysis was undertaken to determine the impact of a range of sociodemographic characteristics on vaccination uptake, including ethnicity, country of birth, severe mental illness, homelessness and substance use. We found that overall uptake of first dose of COVID-19 vaccination was high in Wales (92.1 %), with the highest among those aged 80 years and over and females. Those aged under 40 years, household composition (aOR 0.38 95 %CI 0.35-0.41 for 10+ size household compared to two adult household) and being born outside the UK (aOR 0.44 95 %CI 0.43-0.46) had the strongest negative associations with vaccination uptake.

Multiple logistic regression models estimated the association between social and health factors and tuberculosis treatment outcomes.FINDINGS: 67 360 young people with tuberculosis were notified to SINAN, and we included 41 870 young people in our study. 7024 (17%) of the 41 870 included individuals had unfavourable treatment outcomes. Young people who received government cash transfers were less likely to have an unfavourable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0·83, 95% CI 0·70-0·99). Homelessness (3·03, 2·07-4·42), HIV (2·89, 2·45-3·40), and illicit drug use (2·22, 1·93-2·55) were the main factors associated with unfavourable treatment outcome.INTERPRETATION: In this national cohort of young people with tuberculosis in Brazil, tuberculosis treatment success rates were lower than WHO End TB Strategy targets, with almost a fifth of participants experiencing unfavourable treatment outcomes. Homelessness, HIV, and illicit drug use were the main factors associated with unfavourable outcome. In Brazil, strategies are required to support this underserved group to ensure favourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes.FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, UK Medical Research Council, and UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office.",2021,,Lancet Glob Health,9,10,e1380-e1390,,10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00300-4,,#3786,Chenciner 2021,,
"Earthquake-related stressors associated with suicidality, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress in adolescents from Muisne after the earthquake 2016 in Ecuador","Gerstner, Rebekka M. F.; Lara-Lara, Fernando; Vasconez, Eduardo; Viscor, Ginés; Jarrin, Juan D.; Ortiz-Prado, Esteban","BACKGROUND: The Ecuadorian earthquake in April 16th was the second strongest and deadliest in 2016 worldwide, with approximately one million people affected. In this paper, we analyzed the psychological impact and the relationship between mental health events and various earthquake-related stressors related to the earthquake, 9 months after the event.METHODS: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study, applying an anonymous survey to 316 adolescents (13-19 years old) from Muisne, Ecuador. Suicidal tendency, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress (PTSD) were evaluated via the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS), Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, Okasha Suicidality Scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the adapted seven-questions earthquake-related stressors survey.RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of suicidal ideations and behavior, posttraumatic stress, depression and anxiety compared to international studies. Even though adolescents currently living in shelters had higher levels of anxiety, their suicidal tendency was significantly lower than those living in their own or their relatives' home. Finally, the earthquake-related stressors were not associated with suicidality and mental health events, with the exception of economic damage suffered by the family.CONCLUSIONS: High levels of depression, post-traumatic stress and anxiety among high-school students were found, especially among those who have suffered serious economic damage. The economic impact in their families and high unemployment rates among their parents seems to be related to lack of hope and favorable perspectives for their future, situation that might lead to lead to emotional disturbances and psychological disorders. Although prolonged homelessness experience in shelters may be a stressful occurrence, might also be related with spiritual growth among adolescents, and may work as a protective factor against suicidal ideations and attempts.",2020,,BMC Psychiatry,20,1,347,,10.1186/s12888-020-02759-x,,#3789,Gerstner 2020,,
"Homelessness, Discrimination, and Violent Victimization in Los Angeles County","Padwa, Howard; Chien, Jessie; Henwood, Benjamin F.; Cousins, Sarah J.; Zakher, Edward; Kuhn, Randall","INTRODUCTION: People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are highly vulnerable to discrimination and violence, which impact physical and mental health. The study examines past-month discrimination and violence against PEH in Los Angeles County (LAC).METHODS: A total of 332 PEH in LAC were surveyed about their past-month experiences with discrimination, physical violence, and sexual violence from April-July 2023. Analyses were conducted in 2023.RESULTS: 31.8% of respondents reported experiencing discrimination daily and 53.9% reported it weekly, whereas rates of lifetime discrimination in studies of general populations of minoritized groups range between 13-60%. Nearly half of respondents who reported experiencing discrimination (49.6%) believed that their housing situation was the reason they were targeted. Victimization was also common, with 16.0% of participants experiencing physical violence and 7.5% experiencing sexual violence in the past 30 days. These rates of past-month victimization are high when compared to past-year physical violence (3.0%) and sexual violence (0.24%) among general populations in major U.S. cities. In multivariate regression analyses, discrimination was associated with being unsheltered in a vehicle (p<0.05) or outdoors (p<0.001), weekly illicit drug use (p<0.01), and psychological distress (p<0.001); violent victimization was associated with being sheltered (p<0.05) or unsheltered outdoors (p<0.001), physical health conditions (p<0.05), and psychological distress (p<0.01); and sexual victimization was associated with non-male gender (p<0.05) and being unsheltered outdoors (p<0.05). Discrimination and victimization outcomes were not associated with any race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, or time homeless characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Study findings highlight the dangers of homelessness in the U.S., particularly for those who are unsheltered outdoors.",2024,,Am J Prev Med,67,5,666-675,,10.1016/j.amepre.2024.06.016,,#3792,Padwa 2024,,
Syndemic factors associated with non-fatal overdose among young opioid users in New York City,"Guarino, Honoria; Frank, David; Quinn, Kelly; Kim, Dongah; Gile, Krista; Ruggles, Kelly; Friedman, Samuel R.; Mateu-Gelabert, Pedro","INTRODUCTION: Rates of illicit opioid use are particularly high among young adults, yet research on overdose experience and factors associated with overdose in this population remains limited. This study examines the experiences and correlates of non-fatal overdose among young adults using illicit opioids in New York City (NYC).METHODS: 539 participants were recruited via Respondent-Driven Sampling in 2014-2016. Eligibility criteria included: aged 18-29 years old; current residence in NYC; and nonmedical prescription opioid (PO) use and/or heroin use in the past 30 days. Participants completed structured interviews to assess their socio-demographics, drug use trajectories, current substance use and lifetime and most recent overdose experiences, and were tested on-site for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.RESULTS: 43.9% of participants reported lifetime overdose experience; of these, 58.8% had experienced two or more overdose events. The majority of participants' most recent overdoses (63.5%) were due to polysubstance use. In bivariable analyses, after RDS adjustment, having ever overdosed was correlated with: household income of >$100,00 growing up (vs. $51,000-100,000); lifetime homelessness; HCV antibody-positive status; lifetime engagement in regular nonmedical benzodiazepine use, regular heroin injection and regular PO injection; and using a non-sterile syringe in the past 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression identified childhood household income >$100,00 (AOR=1.88), HCV-positive status (AOR=2.64), benzodiazepine use (AOR=2.15), PO injection (AOR=1.96) and non-sterile syringe use (AOR=1.70) as significant independent correlates of lifetime overdose. A multivariable model with multiple overdoses (vs. one) found only lifetime regular heroin use and PO injection to be strong correlates.DISCUSSION: Results indicate a high prevalence of lifetime and repeated overdose among opioid-using young adults in NYC, highlighting a need for intensified overdose prevention efforts for this population. The strong associations of HCV and indices of polydrug use with overdose suggest that prevention efforts should address the complex risk environment in which overdose occurs, attending to the overlapping nature of disease-related risk behavior and overdose risk behavior among young people who inject opioids. Overdose prevention efforts tailored for this group may find it useful to adopt a syndemic conception of overdose that understands such events as resulting from multiple, and often interrelated, risk factors.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1195657,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1195657,,#3795,Guarino 2023,,
Childhood adversity and clinical and psychosocial outcomes in psychosis,"Turner, S.; Harvey, C.; Hayes, L.; Castle, D.; Galletly, C.; Sweeney, S.; Shah, S.; Keogh, L.; Spittal, M. J.","AIMS: Associations between childhood abuse and various psychotic illnesses in adulthood are commonly reported. We aim to examine associations between several reported childhood adverse events (sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and interpersonal loss) among adults with diagnosed psychotic disorders and clinical and psychosocial outcomes.METHODS: Within a large epidemiological study, the 2010 Australian National Survey of Psychosis (Survey of High Impact Psychosis, SHIP), we used logistic regression to model childhood adverse events (any and specific types) on 18 clinical and psychosocial outcomes.RESULTS: Eighty percent of SHIP participants (1466/1825) reported experiencing adverse events in childhood (sexual abuse, other types of abuse and interpersonal loss). Participants reporting any form of childhood adversity had higher odds for 12/18 outcomes we examined. Significant associations were observed with all psychosocial outcomes (social dysfunction, victimisation, offending and homelessness within the previous 12 months, and definite psychosocial stressor within 12 months of illness onset), with the strongest association for homelessness (odds ratio (OR) = 2.82). Common across all adverse event types was an association with lifetime depression, anxiety and a definite psychosocial stressor within 12 months of illness onset. When adverse event types were non-hierarchically coded, sexual abuse was associated with 11/18 outcomes, other types of abuse 13/18 and, interpersonal loss occurring in the absence of other forms of abuse was associated with fewer of the clinical and psychosocial outcomes, 4/18. When adverse events types were coded hierarchically (to isolate the effect of interpersonal loss in the absence of abuse), interpersonal loss was associated with lower odds of self-reproach (OR = 0.70), negative syndrome (OR = 0.75) and victimisation (OR = 0.82).CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences among people with psychosis are common, as are subsequent psychosocial stressors. Mental health professionals should routinely enquire about all types of adversities in this group and provide effective service responses. Childhood abuse, including sexual abuse, may contribute to subsequent adversity, poor psychosocial functioning and complex needs among people with psychosis. Longitudinal research to better understand these relationships is needed, as are studies which evaluate the effectiveness of preventative interventions in high-risk groups.",2019,,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,29,,e78,,10.1017/S2045796019000684,,#3798,Turner 2019,,
Prevalence and factors associated with polydrug use among clients seeking treatment for alcohol misuse,"Lawson, Samuel; Bryant, Jamie; Freund, Megan; Dizon, Joshua; Haber, Paul S.; Shakeshaft, Anthony; Jefferies, Meryem; Farrell, Michael","INTRODUCTION: The aim of this paper was to examine the client and psychosocial characteristics associated with polydrug use in patients with alcohol misuse as their primary drug of concern (PDC) seeking treatment from substance use treatment centres.METHODS: Self-report surveys were undertaken with clients attending 1 of 34 community-based substance use treatment centres across Australia with alcohol as their PDC. Survey items included client's socio-demographic characteristics, level of alcohol dependence, use of other drugs including tobacco, health and wellbeing factors including health-related quality of life. The factors associated with polydrug use (alcohol use concurrent with at least one other drug) were examined.RESULTS: In a sample of 1130 clients seeking treatment primarily for alcohol problems, 71% reported also using another drug. The most frequently used drug was tobacco (50%) followed by cannabis (21%) and benzodiazepines (15%). Excluding tobacco use, 35% of participants reported polydrug use. Factors associated with any polydrug use were younger age, lower education levels, lower levels of mental health related quality of life and housing risk (i.e., risk of eviction or experienced homelessness in past 4 weeks). When tobacco was excluded, factors associated with polydrug use were age, lower physical and mental health-related quality of life, and housing risk.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Most adults seeking treatment for alcohol misuse as their PDC reported using another drug in addition to alcohol. Treatment services should be designed accordingly to maximise the likelihood of treatment engagement and success.",2024,,Drug Alcohol Rev,43,5,1194-1203,,10.1111/dar.13833,,#3801,Lawson 2024,,
Characterization of Bodily Pain and Use of Both Prescription and Non-Prescription Opioids in Tenants of Precarious Housing,"Lei, Michelle; Rintoul, Kathryn; Stubbs, Jacob L.; Kim, David D.; Jones, Andrea A.; Hamzah, Yasmin; Procyshyn, Ric M.; Gicas, Kristina M.; Cho, Lianne L.; Panenka, William J.; Thornton, Allen E.; Lang, Donna J.; MacEwan, G.

Past research has shown that among those who use non-prescribed or diverted opioids recreationally, many were first exposed to the drug as prescribed pain medication. Objective: to better understand the relationship between pain and opioid use in tenants of precarious housing. Methods: in the present study, 440 individuals from a cohort living in homeless or precariously housed conditions in a neighborhood with high rates of poverty and drug use were interviewed for their bodily pain and opioid use. We examined the relationship between bodily pain levels, assessed using the Maudsley Addiction Profile questionnaire, and prescribed, non-prescribed and combined self-reported opioid use in the prior 28 days assessed using the Timeline Followback and Doctor-Prescribed Medication Timeline Followback questionnaires. Results: Analysis of the results indicated that sex (female), age (younger) and early exposure to opioids (≤ age 18) predicted current opioid use, but there was no association between current bodily pain levels and opioid use.

Deaths among homeless in northern Tunisia: a 10-year study (2005-2014),"Ben Khelil, M.; Zgarni, A.; Bellali, M.; Thaljaoui, W.; Zhioua, M.; Hamdoun, M.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the victims profile related to death among homeless people.STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive, retrospective, and cross-sectional study.METHODS: We included all deaths among homeless people that occurred during a 10-year period (2005-2014) that were autopsied in the Department of Legal Medicine of the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis. Causes of death were classified according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision. Data were classified in three sections: sociodemographic data, circumstances of death, and autopsy findings. A univariate data analysis was performed.RESULTS: The sex ratio (M/F) was of 7.45. The average age was of 59 years. The majority of deaths (80.9%) occurred in the metropolis of Tunis with a significant occurrence of cases in other governorates after the 2011 revolution (P = 0.002). Deaths occurred more often during winter (34.8%). The bodies were frequently discovered in public places (36.0%) and private locations (34.0%). The deaths of 55.3% of cases were attributed to natural causes, significantly affecting the elderly, whereas the accidental causes (25.7%) were more frequent before the age of 49 years, followed by suicides (3.9%) and homicides (3.3%).CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted a phenomenon not yet studied in Tunisia.

Medication treatment for alcohol use disorder in special populations,"Malhotra, Aniket; Drexler, Karen; Hsu, Michael; Tang, Yi-Lang","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant public health concern, with underutilized effective treatments, particularly in special populations. This article summarizes the current evidence and guidelines for treating AUD in special populations.METHODS: This article is a literature review that synthesizes the latest research on AUD treatment for special populations. We screened 242 articles and included 57 in our final review.RESULTS: There are four food and Drug Administration-approved medications for AUD (MAUD): disulfiram, oral naltrexone, extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX), and acamprosate. Naltrexone and disulfiram have the potential to cause liver toxicity, and acamprosate should be avoided in patients with severe kidney disease. Psychosocial treatments should be considered first-line for pregnant and nursing patients. Naltrexone is contraindicated in patients on opioids, as it may precipitate acute withdrawal. For patients experiencing homelessness, nonabstinent treatment goals may be more practical, and XR-NTX should be considered to improve adherence. Limited evidence suggests medication can improve AUD treatment outcomes in adolescents and young adults. For patients with poor treatment response despite adequate medication adherence, switching to a different medication and augmentation with psychosocial treatments should be considered.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the unique considerations for special populations with AUD is crucial, and addressing their special needs may improve their treatment outcomes.SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our study significantly contributes to the existing literature by summarizing crucial information for the treatment of AUD in special populations, highlighting distinct challenges, and emphasizing tailored approaches to improve overall health and well-being.",2023,,Am J Addict,32,5,433-441,,10.1111/ajad.13455,,#3810,Malhotra 2023,,
Virtual care expansion in the Veterans Health Administration during the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical services and patient characteristics associated with utilization,"Ferguson, Jacqueline M.; Jacobs, Josephine; Yefimova, Maria; Greene, Liberty; Heyworth, Leonie; Zulman, Donna M.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the shift from in-person to virtual care within Veterans Affairs (VA) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify at-risk patient populations who require greater resources to overcome access barriers to virtual care.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outpatient encounters (N = 42 916 349) were categorized by care type (eg, primary, mental health, etc) and delivery method (eg, in-person, video). For 5 400 878 Veterans, we used generalized linear models to identify patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with: 1) use of virtual (phone or video) care versus no virtual care and 2) use of video care versus no video care between March 11, 2020 and June 6, 2020.RESULTS: By June, 58% of VA care was provided virtually compared to only 14% prior. Patients with lower income, higher disability, and more chronic conditions were more likely to receive virtual care during the pandemic. Yet, Veterans aged 45-64 and 65+ were less likely to use video care compared to those aged 18-44 (aRR 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 0.82] and 0.50 [95% CI 0.48, 0.52], respectively).

(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04141917).SETTING: 14 homeless shelters in King County, Washington.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1434 study encounters were done in shelter residents and staff, regardless of symptoms.INTERVENTION: 2 strategies were used for SARS-CoV-2 testing: routine surveillance and contact tracing (""surge testing"") events.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was test positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at shelters, determined by dividing the number of positive cases by the total number of participant encounters, regardless of symptoms. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic variables were assessed as correlates of viral positivity.RESULTS: Among 1434 encounters, 29 (2% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.9%]) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected across 5 shelters. Most (n = 21 [72.4%]) were detected during surge testing events rather than routine surveillance, and most (n = 21 [72.4% {CI, 52.8% to 87.3%}]) were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. Persons who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently aged 60 years or older than those without SARS-CoV-2 (44.8% vs. 15.9%). Eighty-six percent of persons with positive test results slept in a communal space rather than in a private or shared room.LIMITATION: Selection bias due to voluntary participation and a relatively small case count.CONCLUSION: Active surveillance and surge testing were used to detect multiple cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in homeless shelters.

Amenable mortality within the New Zealand homeless population: we can do better!,"Charvin-Fabre, Sandrine; Stolte, Ottilie; Lawrenson, Ross","AIM: To describe the context surrounding the deaths of homeless people in New Zealand and to determine the proportion of deaths that could be considered amenable to healthcare.METHOD: We used coroners' findings related to 171 deaths of persons with ""no fixed abode"" at the time of death, from 2008 to 2019. Recent lists of amenable mortality from the New Zealand Ministry of Health and the Office of National Statistics in the UK were combined to determine the rate of amenable mortality.RESULTS: The life expectancy of homeless persons identified in this sample was 30 years shorter than in the housed population, with a mean age of death of 45.7 years. Deaths occurred mainly alone, in public spaces (56.1%) or in private vehicles (14%). Three-quarters (75.8%) of homeless persons died from conditions amenable to timely and effective healthcare interventions, mostly from natural causes (45.7%) and suicide (41.5%).CONCLUSION: Homeless people experience considerable challenges when accessing the healthcare system, as uncovered by the dramatic rate of amenable mortality.

Understanding the Intersection of Behavioral Risk and Social Determinants of Health and the Impact on an Outbreak of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Among Persons Who Inject Drugs in Philadelphia,"Kim, Melissa M.; Conyngham, S. Caitlin; Smith, Champagnae; Higgins, Dana; Nassau, Tanner; Terrell, Coleman; Brady, Kathleen A.","BACKGROUND: In 2018, Philadelphia identified an outbreak of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Although conventional HIV surveillance systems capture individual-level behavioral risk, they are not able to capture the social and environmental factors contributing to rapid transmission.METHODS: HIV surveillance data were used to assess demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors for PWID with HIV diagnosed during 2017 and 2018. Social factors such as homelessness, disruption of encampments, and trends in sexual behaviors, drug use and syringe availability among PWID were captured through National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, routine hepatitis and sexually transmitted infection surveillance, and shelter and homeless outreach data.RESULTS: In 2018, there were 71 new infections among PWID, an increase of 115% since 2016. During this time, opioid overdose deaths peaked at 59 deaths per 100 000 persons, 85% of which involved the use of fentanyl. While overall reported homelessness increased, rates of those living unsheltered rose by 13%. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health identified increased injection frequency, encampment closures, and lack of syringe access as promoters of continued HIV transmission.CONCLUSION: The use of conventional surveillance methods only is inadequate for determining HIV risk during outbreaks.

Factors associated with chronic pain and non-medical opioid use among people who inject drugs,"Bicket, Mark C.; Park, Ju Nyeong; Torrie, Arissa; Allen, Sean T.; Weir, Brian W.; Sherman, Susan G.","INTRODUCTION: Despite rising morbidity and mortality from the opioid epidemic and other addictions, people who inject drugs (PWID) remain understudied regarding pain outcomes. Data among PWID regarding chronic pain and drug use, including non-medical use of opioids, is largely unknown. We examined the prevalence of chronic pain and drug use for pain in this population.METHODS: Standardized surveys captured self-report of demographics, chronic pain, and non-prescription drug use in 203 PWID in an urban syringe services program between April and November 2016. Chronic pain was defined as self-report of chronic pain diagnosis or persistent pains over the past 6 months.RESULTS: Overall, 47% (95% CI, 40%-54%) of PWID reported chronic pain, while 35% (95% CI, 29%-42%) reported non-prescription drug use of any type for pain. Among those with chronic pain, drug use to treat pain was commonly reported (76%; 95% CI, 66%-83%). Non-medical opioid use did not differ among PWID with or without chronic pain or drug use for pain. A multivariable logistic regression model showed chronic pain was more likely among non-Hispanic whites and those with arthritis, older age, and homelessness.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain serves as an important factor in the persistence of drug use in more than one-third of PWID in this sample. The high prevalence of chronic pain with drug use for pain suggests that proper pain management is likely to be an essential component of preventing or regressing injection drug use in PWID, with data needed on effective interventions for this population.",2020,,Addict Behav,102,,106172,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106172,,#3825,Bicket 2020,,
Risk of homelessness after discharge from psychiatric wards in Denmark: a nationwide register-based cohort study,"Nilsson, S. F.; Laursen, T. M.; Hjorthøj, C.; Nordentoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the absolute and relative risk of homelessness following discharge from psychiatric wards in Denmark.METHODS: A nationwide, register-based, cohort study including people aged 18+ years discharged from psychiatric wards in Denmark between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2015. We analysed associations between psychiatric diagnoses and risk of homelessness using survival analysis.RESULTS: A total of 126 848 psychiatric in-patients were included accounting for 94 835 person-years. The incidence of homelessness one year following discharge was 28.18 (95% CI 26.69-29.75) and 9.27 (95% CI 8.45-10.16) per 1000 person-years at risk in men and women respectively. The one-year cumulative probability of first homelessness after discharge from psychiatric wards was 1.58% (95% CI 1.48-1.68) in males and 0.55% (95% CI 0.50-0.61) in females. Substance use disorders increased the risk of homelessness after discharge with adjusted incidence rate ratios of 6.60 (95% CI 5.19-8.40) (men) and 13.06 (95% CI 9.31-18.33) (women), compared with depressive disorders. Prior history of homelessness was an important predictor for homelessness following discharge.CONCLUSIONS: The first year following discharge from psychiatric wards is a high-risk period of homelessness, especially when having a substance use disorder or a prior history of homeless shelter contact.

Exclusion criteria were focal neurologic deficits on exam, alternative medical etiology (i.e. delirium, trauma) and/or pre-existing CNS disease. Clinical, demographic and administrative data were extracted with 10% of charts independently reviewed by an Emergency Physician for inter-rater reliability.RESULTS: 266 cases met study criteria. Population demographics: 49% percent female, average age 51years old, 28% homeless, 58% arrived by police or ambulance. CT head results: 1 (0.4%) case with possible acute findings, 105 (39%) with incidental findings (i.e. cerebral atrophy) that did not impact clinical management. Average time to physician assessment was 1:48 (hour:min) (sd 1:11), time to CT completion was 5:05 (sd 7:28) and an average delay of 3:17 awaiting results. Subgroup analysis revealed a net increase in ED length of stay (ED LOS) of 5:02 from obtaining neuroimaging. 85% of patients were referred to a consultant, 92% were to psychiatry.CONCLUSIONS: CT head results prolonged ED LOS, delayed patient disposition and did not change the patient's clinical management. A prospective trial for ordering CT head scans in these patients is warranted.",2018,,Am J Emerg Med,36,2,213-217,,10.1016/j.ajem.2017.07.080,,#3834,Ng 2018,,
A randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of Housing First in a small Canadian City,"Aubry, Tim; Bourque, Jimmy; Goering, Paula; Crouse, Susan; Veldhuizen, Scott; LeBlanc, Stefanie; Cherner, Rebecca; Bourque, Paul-Émile; Pakzad, Sarah; Bradshaw, Claudette","BACKGROUND: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed.METHODS: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N = 100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N = 101). Participants were interviewed every 3 months over 21/24 months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery.RESULTS: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25 days, d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p < 0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z = 5.30, p < 0.001, OR = 3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z = 4.59, p < 0.001, d = 0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6 months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), χ2 (2, n = 170) = 11.46, p = .003, Cramer's V = 0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z = 3.83, p < 0.001, ASMD = 0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z = 12.89, p < 0.001, pooled ASMD = 0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z = 2.26, p = 0.03, ASMD = 0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants.CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness.TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register Identifier: ISRCTN42520374 , assigned August 18, 2009.",2019,,BMC Public Health,19,1,1154,,10.1186/s12889-019-7492-8,,#3837,Aubry 2019,,
Examining Health Care Mobility of Transgender Veterans Across the Veterans Health Administration,"Wang, Karen H.; McAvay, Gail; Warren, Allison; Miller, Mary L.; Pho, Anthony; Blosnich, John R.; Brandt, Cynthia A.; Goulet, Joseph L.","Purpose: Transgender veterans are overrepresented in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) compared with in the general population. Utilization of multiple different health care systems, or health care mobility, can affect care coordination and potentially affect outcomes, either positively or negatively. This study examines whether transgender veterans are more or less health care mobile than nontransgender veterans and compares the patterns of geographic mobility in these groups. Methods: Using an established cohort (n = 5,414,109), we identified 2890 transgender veterans from VHA electronic health records from 2000 to 2012. We compared transgender and nontransgender veterans on sociodemographic, clinical, and health care system-level measures and conducted conditional logistic regression models of mobility. Results: Transgender veterans were more likely to be younger, White, homeless, have depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and hepatitis C. Transgender veterans were more likely to have been health care mobile (9.9%) than nontransgender veterans (5.2%) (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.73-2.36). In a multivariable model, transgender status, being separated/divorced, receiving care in less-complex facilities, and diagnoses of depression, PTSD, or hepatitis C were associated with more mobility, whereas older age was associated with less mobility. For the top three health care systems utilized, a larger proportion of transgender veterans visited a second health care system in a different state (56.2%) than nontransgender veterans (37.5%). Conclusions: Transgender veterans were more likely to be health care mobile and more likely to travel out of state for health care services. They were also more likely to have complex chronic health conditions that require multidisciplinary care.",2021,,LGBT Health,8,2,143-151,,10.1089/lgbt.2020.0152,,#3840,Wang 2021,,

Unadjusted risk ratios (RRs) were used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics by syphilis stage (primary, secondary, or early latent vs late latent or unknown) and treatment status during pregnancy (adequate per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021"" vs inadequate or not treated) and by prenatal care (timely: at least 30 days before pregnancy outcome; nontimely: less than 30 days before pregnancy outcome; and no prenatal care).RESULTS: As of September 15, 2023, of 1,476 people with syphilis during pregnancy, 855 (57.9%) were adequately treated and 621 (42.1%) were inadequately treated or not treated. Eighty-two percent of the cohort received timely prenatal care. Although those with nontimely or no prenatal care were more likely to receive inadequate or no treatment (RR 2.50, 95% CI, 2.17-2.88 and RR 2.73, 95% CI, 2.47-3.02, respectively), 32.1% of those with timely prenatal care were inadequately or not treated.

Social determinants and emergency department utilization: Findings from the Veterans Health Administration,"Davis, Camille I.; Montgomery, Ann Elizabeth; Dichter, Melissa E.; Taylor, Laura D.; Blosnich, John R.","BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDH) are strong predictors of morbidity and mortality but health care systems struggle to integrate documentation of SDH into health records in ways that can be used for health services research. Given the impact of social factors on health, it is important to examine the relationship with emergency department (ED) utilization.OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between seven indicators of SDH and ED utilization using electronic health record (EHR) data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis included data from all patients who had at least one health care visit in the Veterans Integrated Service Network region 4 from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 (n=293,872). Seven categories of adverse SDH included violence, housing instability, employment or financial problems, legal problems, social or family problems, lack of access to care or transportation, and non-specific psychosocial needs identified through structured coding in EHR. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the association of the count of adverse SDH (0-7) with the count of ED visits, adjusting for socio-demographic and health-related factors.RESULTS: Approximately 18% of patients visited the ED during the observation period. After adjusting for covariates, adverse SDH were positively associated with VHA ED utilization. Each of the SDH indicators, other than legal issues, was positively associated with increased ED utilization.CONCLUSION: Even after accounting for several demographic and health-related factors, adverse SDH demonstrated strong positive associations with VHA ED utilization.",2020,,Am J Emerg Med,38,9,1904-1909,,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.078,,#3846,Davis 2020,,
"Unfavorable Outcomes in Tuberculosis: Multidimensional Factors among Adolescents in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","de Oliveira, Marcia C. B.; Sant'Anna, Clemax C.; Raggio Luiz, Ronir; Kritski, Afrânio L.","Since 2018, adolescents have been included as a target group for tuberculosis (TB) surveillance by the WHO. However, they are considered a neglected population, as there are considerable gaps in information about them. We aimed to analyze the risk factors for unfavorable TB treatment outcomes among adolescents in Rio de Janeiro, a Brazilian city with a high burden of TB. This is a retrospective study of adolescents (10-18 years) with TB notified in Rio de Janeiro, from four national database systems, covering 2014-2016. ""Extreme vulnerability"" was defined as adolescents who presented one of the following characteristics: homelessness, incarceration, tobacco use, illicit drug use, or alcohol abuse. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with favorable (cure/completed treatment) and unfavorable outcomes (lost to follow-up, death, and treatment failure). A total of 725 adolescents with TB were included: 610 (84.1%) were cured, 94 (13%) were lost to follow-up, six (0.8%) died because of TB, 13 (1.8%) died because of other causes, and two (0.3%) failed treatment. Unfavorable outcomes were associated with retreatment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.51; 95% CI: 2.23-9.17), TB-HIV coinfection (aOR: 10.15; 95% CI: 4.15-25.34), extreme vulnerability (aOR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.70-5.33), and living in the two districts (3.1 and 3.3) with worst conditions: large population and rates of homicides and shantytowns (aOR: 4.11; 95% CI: 1.79-9.46 and aOR: 5.35; 95% CI: 2.20-13.03, respectively).

Financial Capability: Clinicians' Assessment of Beneficiaries With Dual Diagnoses,"Thornhill Iv, Thomas A.; Black, Anne C.; Rosen, Marc I.","OBJECTIVE: Adults with mental health disorders whose ability to work is sufficiently impeded are entitled to financial supports from the Social Security Administration. Beneficiaries determined to be incapable of managing these funds are supposed to be assigned a representative payee to assist beneficiaries in meeting their needs. However, patterns of payee assignment suggest that payee assignment is impacted by factors other than those the Social Security Administration instructs clinicians to consider. In this study, we tested the association between clinicians' judgments of their clients' financial capability and hypothesized predictors (demographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnosis, recent alcohol and other substance use, self-rated money mismanagement, recent homelessness, and provider characteristics). We posited that predictors might act indirectly on capability judgment via their impact on beneficiaries' money management.METHODS: Altogether, 261 people receiving intensive mental health care who did not have payees or fiduciaries were enrolled after providing written informed consent. These beneficiaries completed in-person assessment interviews, reporting demographic characteristics, treatment history, substance use, and homelessness. Mental health clinicians identified by the beneficiaries were enrolled in the study and asked to judge their clients' financial capability with standard Social Security instructions for determining capability. Bivariate associations between hypothesized predictors and clinicians' determinations of incapability were tested. In multivariate probit regression models, incapability determination was modeled as a function of all beneficiary and clinician characteristics that had significant bivariate associations with the outcome.RESULTS: Providers identified 24% of their clients as financially incapable. Determinations of financial incapability were unrelated to any beneficiary or provider demographic characteristics but were positively associated with money mismanagement, homelessness, and having a psychotic disorder. Alcohol use and other substance use were only significantly associated with capability determinations indirectly through their effects on money mismanagement.CONCLUSIONS: Providers' judgments of beneficiaries' capability to manage their funds were associated with factors that were consistent with Social Security Administration guidelines and were, importantly, not associated with personal characteristics. This finding suggests that guidelines can be fairly applied by clinicians and that reported inconsistencies in payee assignment are accounted for by other factors. The Social Security Administration is currently considering other approaches to standardize capability determinations.",2018,,J Dual Diagn,14,2,130-136,,10.1080/15504263.2018.1436732,,#3852,ThornhillIv 2018,,
"Typology of changes in quality of life over 12 months among currently or formerly homeless individuals using different housing services in Quebec, Canada","Kaltsidis, Gesthika; Grenier, Guy; Cao, Zhirong; L'Espérance, Nadia; Fleury, Marie-Josée","BACKGROUND: In health and social service evaluations, including research on homelessness, quality of Life (QOL) is often used as a key indicator of well-being among service users. However, no typology has been developed on changes in QOL over a 12-month period for a heterogenous sample of homeless individuals.METHODS: Cluster analysis was employed to identify a typology of change in QOL for 270 currently or formerly homeless individuals using emergency shelters, temporary housing (TH) and permanent housing (PH) services in Quebec (Canada). Participant interviews were conducted at baseline and 12 months later. An adapted Gelberg-Andersen Model helped organize QOL-related sociodemographic, clinical, and service use variables into predisposing, needs, and enabling factors, respectively. Comparison analyses were performed to determine group differences.RESULTS: Four groups emerged from the analyses: (1) young women in stable-PH or improved housing status with moderately high needs and specialized ambulatory care service use, with improved QOL over 12 months; (2) middle-age to older men with stable housing status, few needs and low acute care service use, with most improvement in QOL over 12 months; (3) older individuals residing in stable-PH or improved housing status with very high needs and reduced QOL over 12 months; and (4) men in stable-TH or worse housing status, with high substance use disorder, using few specialized ambulatory care services and showing decline in QOL over 12 months.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that positive change in QOL over 12 months was mainly associated with fewer needs, and stability in housing status more than housing improvement. Specific recommendations, such as assertive community treatment and harm reduction programs, should be prioritized for individuals with high needs or poor housing status, and among those experiencing difficulties related to QOL, whereas individuals with more favourable profiles could be encouraged to maintain stable housing and use services proportional to their needs.",2021,,Health Qual Life Outcomes,19,1,128,,10.1186/s12955-021-01768-y,,#3855,Kaltsidis 2021,,
Sexual risk-taking among homeless young people in Pakistan,"Noor, Muhammad N.; Holt, Martin; Qureshi, Ayaz; de Wit, John; Bryant, Joanne","Homeless young people who engage in sex work are at increased risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and herpes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 homeless young people between the ages of 16 and 25 years from Rawalpindi, Pakistan, to explore how sexual practices were mediated through social and contextual conditions. Participants engaged in sex for a range of reported reasons, most commonly to generate income, but also to build intimacy and to establish intimate partnerships which could bring physical protection and social and emotional support. Although participants were aware of the sexual health risks attached to condomless sex, they engaged in it due to the social obligations of intimate partnerships, financial considerations and to better manage potentially violent situations. Instead of condoms, participants used alternate methods like withdrawal, oral sex, post-sex douching and specific sexual positions. These were not always useful, and some methods might have inadvertently increased their risk of HIV. The study findings suggest that an integrated health promotion approach that goes beyond the health sector and a singular emphasis on risk awareness may help reduce young people's risk of homelessness and sexual health risks.",2021,,Health Soc Care Community,29,5,1550-1558,,10.1111/hsc.13220,,#3858,Noor 2021,,
"Associations between prescription and illicit stimulant and opioid use in the United States, 2015-2020","Shearer, Riley D.; Jones, Abenaa; Howell, Benjamin A.; Segel, Joel E.; Winkelman, Tyler N. A.","INTRODUCTION: Overdose deaths involving opioids and stimulants continue to reach unprecedented levels in the United States. Although significant attention has been paid to the relationship between prescription and illicit opioid use, little work has focused on the association between prescription and illicit stimulant use. Thus, this study explores characteristics of those who use or misuse prescription stimulants and/or opioids and associations with use of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin.METHODS: We used 2015-2020 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Using adjusted multivariable logistic regression, we estimated the associations between past year prescription stimulant or prescription opioid prescribed use and misuse; various demographic characteristics; and past-year cocaine, methamphetamine, or heroin use.RESULTS: From 2015 to 2020, 4.9 and 9.8 million US adults annually reported misusing prescription stimulants and opioids, respectively. Individuals who misused prescription stimulants were more likely to be ages 18-25 (45.8 %; 95 % CI: 44.0-47.5) than individuals who misused prescription opioids (21.7 %; 95 % CI: 20.7-22.7). We observed higher rates of cocaine use among individuals reporting prescription stimulant misuse (12.0 %; 95 % CI: 11.0-12.9) compared to those reporting prescription opioid misuse (5.7 %; 95 % CI: 5.1-6.3, p < 0.001). Heroin use was more common among individuals with prescription opioid misuse (2.1 %; 95 % CI: 1.7-2.2) than prescription stimulant misuse (0.6 %; 95 % CI: 0.4-0.7, p < 0.001). However, rates of methamphetamine use among individuals with prescription stimulant misuse (2.4 %; 95 % CI: 1.9-3.0) did not differ from individuals with prescription opioid misuse (2.1 %; 95 % CI: 1.7-2.5, p = 0.67).CONCLUSIONS: Prescription stimulant misuse, compared to prescription opioid misuse, was associated with higher levels of cocaine use but not methamphetamine use. Treatment providers should consider screening for other substance use disorders among people who report prescription stimulant use or misuse. Additional research should seek to understand the mechanism underlying the different associations between prescription stimulant misuse and cocaine or methamphetamine use.",2022,,J Subst Abuse Treat,143,,108894,,10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108894,,#3861,Shearer 2022,,

Deaths that could not be verified by certificate or coroners record were excluded from the study.RESULTS: SMRs were 3-10 times higher in homeless men and 6-10 times higher in homeless women compared with the general population. Drug and alcohol-related deaths were the leading cause of death, accounting for 38.4% of deaths in homeless individuals. These were followed by circulatory (20%) and respiratory causes (13%).CONCLUSION: Mortality rates among homeless persons are exceptionally high.

Interviews were carried out including the Oral Impact on Daily Performance instrument and sociodemographic aspects. Clinical examinations were done by a trained examiner considering criteria of the World Health Organization. We evaluated dental caries (DMFT index) and use or need to use some type of prosthesis. For the statistical analysis of data, we used Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and Poisson regression with robust variance.RESULTS: Of the total respondents, 81.9% had at least one daily performance affected by dental problems in the six months prior the survey. The most prevalent dental conditions were: need for lower arch (76.7%) and upper arch prosthesis (69.0%); untreated caries (75.9%); and high DMFT (57.8%). In bivariate analysis, only the need for upper prosthesis variable was associated with the impact (high Oral Impact on Daily Performance).

We recruited UK-born White subjects with tuberculosis and randomly sampled White community controls. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using case-cohort Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors, including socio-economic status, smoking, drug use, prison and homelessness. Vaccine effectiveness (VE = 1 - hazard ratio) was assessed at successive intervals more than 10 years following vaccination.RESULTS: We obtained 677 cases and 1170 controls after a 65% response rate in both groups. Confounding by deprivation, education and lifestyle factors was slight 10-20 years after vaccination, and more evident after 20 years. VE 10-15 years after vaccination was 51% (95% CI 21, 69%) and 57% (CI 33, 72%) at 15-20 years. Subsequently, BCG protection appeared to wane; 20-25 years VE = 25% (CI -14%, 51%) and 25-29 years VE = 1% (CI -84%, 47%).

Factors Associated with Patient Engagement in a Health and Social Needs Case Management Program,"Lo, Christine H.; Knox, Margae J.; Hernandez, Elizabeth A.; Brewster, Amanda L.","INTRODUCTION: Many patients offered case management services to address their health and social needs choose not to engage. Factors that drive engagement remain unclear. We sought to understand patient characteristics associated with engagement in a social needs case management program and variability by case manager.METHODS: Between August 2017 and February 2021, 43,347 Medicaid beneficiaries with an elevated risk of hospital or emergency department use were offered case management in Contra Costa County, California. Results were analyzed in 2022 using descriptive statistics and multilevel logistic regression models to examine 1) associations between patient engagement and patient characteristics and 2) variation in engagement attributable to case managers. Engagement was defined as responding to case manager outreach and documentation of at least 1 topic to mutually address. A sensitivity analysis was performed by stratifying the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cohorts.RESULTS: A total of 16,811 (39%) of eligible patients engaged. Adjusted analyses indicate associations between higher patient engagement and female gender, age 40 and over, Black/African American race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, history of homelessness, and a medical history of certain chronic conditions and depressive disorder. The intraclass correlation coefficient indicates that 6% of the variation in engagement was explained at the case manager level.CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid patients with a history of housing instability and specific medical conditions were more likely to enroll in case management services, consistent with prior evidence that patients with greater need are more receptive to assistance. Case managers accounted for a small percentage of variation in patient engagement.",2024,,J Am Board Fam Med,37,3,418-426,,10.3122/jabfm.2023.230388R1,,#3876,Lo 2024,,
Baseline differences in characteristics and risk behaviors among people who inject drugs by syringe exchange program modality: an analysis of the Miami IDEA syringe exchange,"Iyengar, Siddharth; Kravietz, Adam; Bartholomew, Tyler S.; Forrest, David; Tookes, Hansel E.","BACKGROUND: In March of 2016, Florida passed the Infection Disease Elimination Act (IDEA), legalizing the formation of the first syringe exchange program in Florida, which opened in December of 2016 at a fixed site in Overtown, Miami. Since that time, the exchange expanded in April of 2017 to include a mobile van unit that provides the same services at different locations throughout Miami-Dade County.METHODS: Trained interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews from all first-time participants at the IDEA Exchange, both at the fixed site and the mobile van unit.RESULTS: Among 718 first-time enrollees, 74.8% were male, 52.1% were non-Hispanic White, 85.9% completed high school, 59.8% were unemployed, 42.1% were homeless, 54.2% reported an annual income of less than $15,000, and the mean age was 38 years. Participants at the fixed site and mobile van unit reported differences in socioeconomic status, injection drug-related behaviors, and pre-existing hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection status.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that the mobile unit is capturing a subset of PWID in Miami that the fixed site is not, and vice-versa. As the opioid crisis extends into all demographics, such multimodal efforts to target various populations of PWID should be kept in mind, especially when unveiling future syringe exchanges in Florida and other late-adopting states.",2019,,Harm Reduct J,16,1,7,,10.1186/s12954-019-0280-z,,#3879,Iyengar 2019,,
The influence of social determinants of health on epilepsy treatment delays in an Arizona Medicaid population,"Sirven, Joseph; Sprout, Gregory T.; Speer, Matthew; Simic, Grant; Ems, Derek; Harootunian, Gevork; Reddy, Swapna","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to better understand the role of social determinants of health (SDoH) in both treatment delays and treatment gaps for individuals with epilepsy (IWE) enrolled in Arizona's Medicaid program using predictive models at the population and individual levels.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, two statistical regression models were developed using Arizona Medicaid medical and pharmacy claims records from 2015-2019 and selected census tract-level SDoH data. Three treatment outcomes were defined: timely treatment (treated within thirty days); delayed treatment (treated after thirty days); and untreated. For the first model, least squares regression was used to regress the epilepsy treatment delays on selected SDoH factors at the population-level. For the second model, multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate associations between epilepsy treatment delays and individual-level sociodemographic factors.RESULTS: Of the 5965 IWE identified with a new epilepsy diagnosis during the study period, 43.1% were treated with a mean delay of 180 days. Among the treated population, 42% received timely treatment. A treatment gap of at least 40.6% and potentially up to 56.9% was calculated. Individuals with epilepsy diagnosed in an inpatient setting or in emergency departments were more likely to be treated and receive timely treatment than those diagnosed in an office or clinic setting. Individuals with epilepsy diagnosed in ""other"" settings were more likely to go untreated or receive delayed treatment than a patient diagnosed in an office or clinic. Compared to IWE aged 31-50 years, IWE aged 0-30 years were more likely to receive timely treatment, IWE aged 51-64 years were more likely to receive delayed treatment, and IWE aged 65 years or older were more likely to go untreated. Widowed IWE were more likely to go untreated relative to single patients. Individuals with epilepsy experiencing homelessness were also more likely to go untreated. Unemployed IWE were more likely to go untreated or receive delayed treatment. Native American IWE were more likely to go untreated compared to White patients.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment gaps and treatment delays are experienced by IWE in the Arizona Medicaid population. The SDoH factors predicted to impact treatment delays include care setting, age, race, marital status, homelessness, and employment.",2022,,Epilepsy Behav,126,,108473,,10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108473,,#3882,Sirven 2022,,
Willingness to use a wearable device capable of detecting and reversing overdose among people who use opioids in Philadelphia,"Kanter, Katie; Gallagher, Ryan; Eweje, Feyisope; Lee, Alexander; Gordon, David; Landy, Stephen; Gasior, Julia; Soto-Calderon, Haideliza; Cronholm, Peter F.; Cocchiaro, Ben; Weimer, James; Roth, Alexis; Lankenau, Stephen; Brenner, Jacob","BACKGROUND: The incidence of opioid-related overdose deaths has been rising for 30 years and has been further exacerbated amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Naloxone can reverse opioid overdose, lower death rates, and enable a transition to medication for opioid use disorder. Though current formulations for community use of naloxone have been shown to be safe and effective public health interventions, they rely on bystander presence. We sought to understand the preferences and minimum necessary conditions for wearing a device capable of sensing and reversing opioid overdose among people who regularly use opioids.METHODS: We conducted a combined cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview at a respite center, shelter, and syringe exchange drop-in program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, during the COVID-19 pandemic in August and September 2020. The primary aim was to explore the proportion of participants who would use a wearable device to detect and reverse overdose. Preferences regarding designs and functionalities were collected via a questionnaire with items having Likert-based response options and a semi-structured interview intended to elicit feedback on prototype designs. Independent variables included demographics, opioid use habits, and previous experience with overdose.RESULTS: A total of 97 adults with an opioid use history of at least 3 months were interviewed. A majority of survey participants (76%) reported a willingness to use a device capable of detecting an overdose and automatically administering a reversal agent upon initial survey. When reflecting on the prototype, most respondents (75.5%) reported that they would wear the device always or most of the time. Respondents indicated discreetness and comfort as important factors that increased their chance of uptake. Respondents suggested that people experiencing homelessness and those with low tolerance for opioids would be in greatest need of the device.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of people sampled with a history of opioid use in an urban setting were interested in having access to a device capable of detecting and reversing an opioid overdose. Participants emphasized privacy and comfort as the most important factors influencing their willingness to use such a device.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04530591.",2021,,Harm Reduct J,18,1,75,,10.1186/s12954-021-00522-3,,#3885,Kanter 2021,,
"Postrelease Risk of Overdose and All-Cause Death Among Persons Released From Jail or Prison: Minnesota, March 2020-December 2021","Hill, Katherine; Bodurtha, Peter J.; Winkelman, Tyler N. A.; Howell, Benjamin A.","Objectives. To determine mortality risk among those recently released from a Minnesota jail or prison. Methods. Using linked prison, jail, and death records, our retrospective cohort study followed 99 065 people who were released from Minnesota jails and prisons between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. We explored differences between jail and prison exposures regarding mortality using standardized mortality ratios. Results. Adjusting for age and gender, we estimated that the rate of overdose death for people released from jail was 15.5 times that of the Minnesota general population. Overdose death rates for people released from prison were even higher at 28.3 times the rate of the Minnesota general population. Conclusions. Drug overdose was the leading cause of death for people reentering their communities from both jail and prison in Minnesota-with opioids being the leading cause of overdoses. Overdose death relative to the general population was double the estimates from earlier studies among people leaving prison. Providing seamless access to medications for opioid use disorder during and after incarceration is important to lower the risk of death following release.

The public health significance of prior homelessness: findings on multimorbidity and mental health from a nationally representative survey,"Chilman, N.; Schofield, P.; McManus, S.; Ronaldson, A.; Stagg, A.; Das-Munshi, J.","AIMS: The associations of prior homelessness with current health are unknown. Using nationally representative data collected in private households in England, this study aimed to examine Common Mental Disorders (CMDs), physical health, alcohol/substance dependence, and multimorbidities in people who formerly experienced homelessness compared to people who never experienced homelessness.METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilised data from the 2007 and 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys. Former homelessness and current physical health problems were self-reported. Current CMDs, alcohol dependence and substance dependence were ascertained using structured validated scales. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to compare multimorbidities (conditions in combination) for participants who formerly experienced homelessness with those who had never experienced homelessness, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status and adverse experiences. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated.RESULTS: Of 13,859 people in the sample, 535 formerly experienced homelessness (3.6%, 95% CI 3.2-4.0). 44.8% of people who formerly experienced homelessness had CMDs (95% CI 40.2-49.5), compared to 15.0% (95% CI 14.3-15.7) for those who had never experienced homelessness. There were substantial associations between prior homelessness and physical multimorbidity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.98, 95% CI 1.53-2.57), CMD-physical multimorbidity (aOR 3.43, 95% CI 2.77-4.25), CMD-alcohol/substance multimorbidity (aOR 3.53, 95% CI 2.49-5.01) and trimorbidity (CMD-alcohol/substance-physical multimorbidity) (aOR 3.26, 95% CI 2.20-4.83), in models adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking. After further adjustment for adverse experiences, associations attenuated but persisted for physical multimorbidity (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.79) and CMD-physical multimorbidity (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20-2.00). The largest PAFs were observed for CMD-alcohol/substance multimorbidity (17%) and trimorbidity (16%).CONCLUSIONS: Even in people currently rehoused, marked inequities across multimorbidities remained evident, highlighting the need for longer-term integrated support for people who have previously experienced homelessness.",2024,,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,33,,e63,,10.1017/S2045796024000659,,#3889,Chilman 2024,,
SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in people experiencing homelessness,"Ralli, M.; De-Giorgio, F.; Pimpinelli, F.; Cedola, C.; Shkodina, N.; Morrone, A.; Arcangeli, A.; Ercoli, L.","OBJECTIVE: People experiencing homelessness have peculiar characteristics that make them more vulnerable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and to more serious forms of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the homeless population assisted by the primary care services of the Eleemosynaria Apostolica, Vatican City.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Persons experiencing homelessness and the volunteers assisting them were tested for COVID-19 through PCR and antigen rapid test between October 1st, 2020, and June 5th, 2021, in the clinical facilities of the Eleemosynaria Apostolica.RESULTS: A total of 1665 subjects from 96 different countries in five continents were included in the study; age range was 1-90 years. Overall, 2315 COVID-19 tests through nasopharyngeal swab were performed; 1052 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests and 1263 antigen rapid tests. Nearly 40% of the subjects underwent both tests (n=650, 39.04%), 402 were tested with PCR test only (24.14%) and 613 with antigen test only (36.8%). PCR tests were negative in 966 cases and positive in 86 (8.17%), while antigen tests were negative in 1205 cases and positive in 58 (4.59%). The number of positive cases varied over time, with a drastic increase during the winter months of 2020 and a progressive decrease over 2021. Among positive cases, 24.41% were symptomatic; symptoms included fever, breathing difficulties, anosmia/hyposmia, cough, headache, and diarrhea.CONCLUSIONS: This study reported an overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our sample slightly above 8%.

Is cannabis a risk factor for suicide attempts in men and women with psychotic illness?,"Waterreus, A.; Di Prinzio, P.; Badcock, J. C.; Martin-Iverson, M.; Jablensky, A.; Morgan, V. A.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether recent cannabis use by men and women with psychotic disorders was associated with increased risk of suicide attempt, and to determine associated factors, stratified by sex.METHODS: Data from 1065 men and 725 women interviewed in the Australian national survey of psychosis were analysed to model separately, for each sex, the impact of daily, casual or no past-year cannabis use and other risk factors including age, on a past-year suicide attempt.RESULTS: In the past year, 168 (9.4%) participants attempted suicide. Unadjusted analyses showed daily cannabis users of both sexes had significantly increased odds of attempting suicide compared to non-users. After adjusting for confounding factors, this relationship was no longer significant. Depression had the strongest association with attempting suicide for both sexes. Sex differences in other risk factors were observed. In post hoc analysis, daily cannabis use was associated with higher odds of attempting suicide in older men compared to non-users; this was not found in younger men or women.CONCLUSIONS: Associations between past-year cannabis use and suicide attempts were confounded by other factors (depression, loneliness, homelessness and hallucinations). The possibility of greater risk of suicidal behaviour with regular cannabis use for older men should be considered.",2018,,Psychopharmacology (Berl),235,8,2275-2285,,10.1007/s00213-018-4924-6,,#3891,Waterreus 2018,,
Attitudinal and behavioural responses to increasing tobacco control regulation among high smoking prevalence groups: A qualitative study,"Parnell, Ashleigh; Box, Emily; Biagioni, Nicole; Bonevski, Billie; Coffin, Juli; Slevin, Terry; Anwar-McHenry, Julia; Pettigrew, Simone","INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Despite substantial reductions in smoking prevalence in many countries, rates remain high among people who are experiencing disadvantage. This study aimed to explore attitudinal and behavioural responses to population-wide tobacco control policies among Australian smokers experiencing disadvantage.DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 84 smokers attending community service organisations in the mental health, homelessness, and alcohol and other drug sectors. Interviewees discussed various tobacco control policies (tobacco taxes, smoke-free areas, plain packaging and graphic health warnings). The interview transcriptions were coded and thematically analysed.RESULTS: Responses to tobacco taxes were mixed. Some interviewees reported smoking less as a result of price increases, while others reallocated funds from other budget areas. Many perceived smoke-free area policies as effective, although some described strategies they use to circumvent this policy, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. Plain packaging and graphic warnings were perceived as being least effective.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: While tobacco control policies can elicit intended attitudinal and behavioural responses, additional efforts are needed to enhance their effectiveness among smokers experiencing disadvantage. Future efforts to reduce smoking rates should address responses that diminish policy effectiveness among groups exhibiting high smoking prevalence. This could be achieved through strategies that address the specific needs of these groups, such as providing additional cessation support, enforcing existing smoke-free policies in ways that minimise inequitable effects, and addressing self-exempting beliefs.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Rev,38,1,92-100,,10.1111/dar.12869,,#3892,Parnell 2019,,
Perinatal substance use treatment and criminal legal system referral trends,"Jones, Cresta; Ford, Becky R.; Shearer, Riley D.; Terplan, Mishka; Stewart, Kelsey; Winkelman, Tyler N. A.","INTRODUCTION: To guide improvements in treatment for pregnant persons with substance use disorders within the criminal legal system, treatment programs must first determine the primary substances of concern for this population. The objective of this study is to compare trends in specific substance use upon admission to treatment in pregnancy, based upon whether referrals originated from the criminal legal system or from another referral source.METHODS: This research accessed data on perinatal substance use (1995-2021) and referral sources from the Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions (TEDS-A). Analyses use multiple logistic regressions to evaluate trends in primary substance use leading to treatment admission during pregnancy.RESULTS: Approximately 1 % (N = 536,948) of all substance use treatment admissions in TEDS-A were for pregnant people. Between 1995 and 2021, the percentage of treatment admissions increased for primary methamphetamine use (10 % to 27 %), primary opioid use (21 % to 38 %), and primary cannabis use (9 % to 18 %), and decreased for primary cocaine use (32 % to 6 %) and primary alcohol use (26 % to 11 %). By 2021, treatment admissions referred from criminal legal agencies were more likely to primarily be for primary methamphetamine use (33 % vs 25 %) and less likely to be for primary opioid use (22 % vs 42 %) compared to other referral sources.CONCLUSIONS: Trends in substance use treatment during pregnancy have changed substantially over the past few decades and emphasize the unique needs of patients referred to treatment by the criminal legal system. Treatment programs must therefore adapt to fluctuating trends in perinatal substance use. In particular, it is important to expand programs that prioritize treatment of methamphetamine use disorder for pregnant people referred through criminal legal agencies.",2024,,J Subst Use Addict Treat,166,,209492,,10.1016/j.josat.2024.209492,,#3893,Jones 2024,,

A national analysis of burn injuries among homeless persons presenting to emergency departments,"Shah, Jennifer K.; Liu, Farrah; Cevallos, Priscila; Amakiri, Uchechukwu O.; Johnstone, Thomas; Nazerali, Rahim; Sheckter, Clifford C.","INTRODUCTION: Burn injuries among the homeless are increasing as record numbers of people are unsheltered and resort to unsafe heating practices. This study characterizes burns in homeless encounters presenting to US emergency departments (EDs).METHODS: Burn encounters in the 2019 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) were queried. ICD-10 and CPT codes identified homelessness, injury regions, depths, total body surface area (TBSA %), and treatment plans. Demographics, comorbidities, and charges were analyzed. Discharge weights generated national estimates. Statistical analysis included univariate testing and multivariate modeling.RESULTS: Of 316,344 weighted ED visits meeting criteria, 1919 (0.6%) were homeless. Homeless encounters were older (mean age 44.83 vs. 32.39 years), male-predominant (71% vs. 52%), and had more comorbidities, and were more often White or Black race (p < 0.001). They more commonly presented to EDs in the West and were covered by Medicaid (51% vs. 33%) (p < 0.001). 12% and 5% of homeless burn injuries were related to self-harm and assault, respectively (p < 0.001). Homeless encounters experienced more third-degree burns (13% vs. 4%; p < 0.001), though TBSA % deciles were not significantly different (34% vs. 33% had TBSA % of ten or lower; p = 0.516). Homeless encounters were more often admitted (49% vs. 7%; p < 0.001), and homelessness increased odds of admission (OR 4.779; p < 0.001). Odds of transfer were significantly lower (OR 0.405; p = 0.021).CONCLUSION: Homeless burn ED encounters were more likely due to assault and self-inflicted injuries, and more severe.

"Assessing the coverage and timeliness of coronavirus vaccination among people experiencing homelessness in Wales, UK: a population-level data-linkage study","Thomas, Ian; Mackie, Peter","BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness have elevated morbidity, increasing their risk of COVID-19 related complications and mortality. Achieving high vaccination coverage in a timely manner among homeless populations was therefore important during the mass vaccination programme in Wales to limit adverse outcomes. However, no systematic monitoring of vaccinations among people experiencing homelessness in Wales has been undertaken.METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using de-identified administrative data. Study cohort members were adults (≥ 18 years old) living in Wales on the 2 December 2020 and who had recently experienced homelessness, defined as experiencing homelessness between 1 July 2020 and 2 December 2020. The outcome of interest was first coronavirus vaccine dose. Follow-up started on 2 December 2020, and ended if the participant died, had a break in address history > 30 days, reached the end of follow up (30 November 2021), or had the outcome of interest. Median-time-to-vaccination was used as a crude measure of 'timeliness' of vaccine uptake. To account for competing risk of death prior to vaccination, vaccine coverage was described using cumulative incidence at 350-days, and at 50-day increments over follow-up (2 December 2020 to 17 November 2021). As a benchmark, all time-to-event measures were generated for the adult population in Wales with similar baseline individual and residential characteristics as the study cohort.RESULTS: 1,595 people with recent experiences of homelessness were identified and included in analysis. The study cohort were disproportionately male (68.8%) and concentrated in the most deprived areas in Wales. Median time-to-vaccination for the study cohort was 196 days (95% CI.: 184-209 days), compared to 141 days (95% CI.: 141-141 days) among the matched adult population in Wales. Cumulative incidence of vaccination after 350-days of follow-up was 60.4% (95% CI.: 57.8-62.8%) among the study cohort, compared to 81.4% (95% CI.: 81.3-81.5%) among the matched adult population. Visual analysis of cumulative incidence over time suggests that vaccine inequality, i.e., difference between study cohort and matched adult population, peaked after 200-days of follow-up, and declined slightly until last follow-up at 350-days.CONCLUSIONS: Despite being prioritised for vaccination, people experiencing homelessness in Wales appear to have been under-engaged, leading to lower vaccination coverage and greater time unvaccinated, potentially increasing their risk of COVID-19 complications and mortality.",2023,,BMC Public Health,23,1,1494,,10.1186/s12889-023-16432-x,,#3897,Thomas 2023,,
"COVID-19 vaccine coverage and factors associated with vaccine uptake among 23 247 adults with a recent history of homelessness in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study","Shariff, Salimah Z.; Richard, Lucie; Hwang, Stephen W.; Kwong, Jeffrey C.; Forchuk, Cheryl; Dosani, Naheed; Booth, Richard","BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness face a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, as well as health complications and death due to COVID-19. Despite being prioritised for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in many regions, little data are available on vaccine uptake in this vulnerable population. Using population-based health-care administrative data from Ontario, Canada-a region with a universal, publicly funded health system-we aimed to describe COVID-19 vaccine coverage (ie, the estimated percentage of people who have received a vaccine) and determinants of vaccine receipt among individuals with a recent history of homelessness.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) with a recent experience of homelessness, inadequate housing, or shelter use as recorded in routinely collected health-care databases between June 14, 2020, and June 14, 2021 (a period within 6 months of Dec 14, 2020, when COVID-19 vaccine administration was initiated in Ontario). Participants were followed up from Dec 14, 2020, to Sept 30, 2021, for the receipt of one or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine using the province's real-time centralised vaccine information system. We described COVID-19 vaccine coverage overall and within predefined subgroups. Using modified Poisson regression, we further identified sociodemographic factors, health-care usage, and clinical factors associated with receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.FINDINGS: 23 247 individuals with a recent history of homelessness were included in this study. Participants were predominantly male (14 752 [63·5%] of 23 247); nearly half were younger than 40 years (11 521 [49·6%]) and lived in large metropolitan regions (12 123 [52·2%]); and the majority (18 226 [78·4%]) visited a general practitioner for an in-person consultation during the observation period. By Sept 30, 2021, 14 271 (61·4%; 95% CI 60·8-62·0) individuals with a recent history of homelessness had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 11 082 (47·7%; 47·0-48·3) had received two doses; in comparison, over the same period, 86·6% of adults in the total Ontario population had received a first dose and 81·6% had received a second dose. In multivariable analysis, factors positively associated with COVID-19 uptake were one or more outpatient visits to a general practitioner (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1·37 [95% CI 1·31-1·42]), older age (50-59 years vs 18-29 years: 1·18 [1·14-1·22], ≥60 years vs 18-29 years: 1·27 [1·22-1·31]), receipt of an influenza vaccine in either of the two previous influenza seasons (1·25 [1·23-1·28]), being identified as homeless via a visit to a community health centre versus exclusively a hospital-based encounter (1·13 [1·10-1·15]), receipt of one or more SARS-CoV-2 tests between March 1, 2020, and Sept 30, 2021 (1·23 [1·20-1·26]), and the presence of chronic health conditions (one condition: 1·05 [1·03-1·08]; two or more conditions: 1·11 [1·08-1·14]). By contrast, living in a smaller metropolitan region (aRR 0·92 [95% CI 0·90-0·94]) or rural location (0·93 [0·90-0·97]) versus large metropolitan regions were associated with lower uptake.INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, COVID-19 vaccine coverage among adults with a recent history of homelessness has lagged and, as of Sept 30, 2021, was 25 percentage points lower than that of the general adult population in Ontario for a first dose and 34 percentage points lower for a second dose. With high usage of outpatient health services among individuals with a recent history of homelessness, better utilisation of outpatient primary care structures might offer an opportunity to increase vaccine coverage in this population. Our findings underscore the importance of leveraging existing health and service organisations that are accessed and trusted by people who experience homelessness for targeted vaccine delivery.FUNDING: The Public Health Agency of Canada.TRANSLATION: For the French translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",2022,,Lancet Public Health,7,4,e366-e377,,10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00037-8,,#3898,Shariff 2022,,
"High willingness to use overdose prevention sites among female sex workers in Baltimore, Maryland","Rouhani, Saba; White, Rebecca Hamilton; Park, Ju Nyeong; Sherman, Susan G.","BACKGROUND: Overdose Prevention Sites (OPS) operate worldwide as spaces where people can consume previously purchased drugs under supervision, and are linked to reductions in HIV/HCV transmission and fatal overdoses. As the United States weighs their merits and legality, research is needed to estimate acceptability and use among populations at high risk for overdose. We examine willingness to use OPS among street-based female sex workers (FSW) with prevalent drug use and associated morbidities.METHODS: We describe self-reported willingness, barriers and conditions around use of a hypothetical OPS among 141 FSW engaged in active drug use in Baltimore City, and describe trends using Pearson's χ2 and Fisher's exact tests.RESULTS: Most women had history of overdose (55 %) and were likely to use OPS (77 %). Willingness was higher among women who: were sexual minorities (97 %;P=0.002),experienced homelessness (82 %;P=0.019), injected drugs (82 %;P=0.013), shared syringes (82 %;P=0.007), experienced sexual violence (92 %;P=0.045) or reported heroin use (83 %;P=0.039) in the past 3 months. Common anticipated barriers included transportation (45 %) and fear of arrest (41 %).CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a population of uniquely high-risk women who would benefit from an OPS integrated with other services. Conditions and barriers discussed are informative for planning and implementation.",2020,,Drug Alcohol Depend,212,,108042,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108042,,#3899,Rouhani 2020,,
Prevalence and Risk Factors associated with Homelessness among Drug Users in Puerto Rico,"Reyes, Juan Carlos; Welch-Lazoritz, Melissa; Zayas-Martinez, Laura; Khan, Bilal; Dombrowski, Kirk","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between years of drug injection and homelessness among drug users in rural Puerto Rico.METHODS: Respondent-driven sampling methods allowed us to obtain a sample of 315 intravenous drug users (IDUs) in rural Puerto Rico. Information about sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, homelessness and risk behaviors was obtained through structured interviews. HIV and HCV statuses were assessed via rapid antibody tests. Frequency distributions were used to describe the study sample. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess covariates of homelessness. The study received IRB approval through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Puerto Rico.RESULTS: Almost 91% of the study participants were males. The mean age was 41.7 years and the majority of the participants had not completed high school (47.6%). The prevalence of current homelessness was 21.9%. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, homelessness was strongly associated with the number of years of injection drug use. The odds of being homeless for IDUs with 21 years or more of drug injection was almost 3 times higher than were the odds of being homeless for IDUs with fewer than 10 years of injection (OR = 2.58 95%; CI=1.21,5.48).CONCLUSION: In rural Puerto Rico, the prevalence of current homelessness in IDUs was 21.7%. In the sample, 6.0% were HIV positive and 78.4% were HCV positive. Our results highlight the necessity of increasing accessibility to substance abuse treatment and establishing additional needle-exchange programs (currently, there is only 1) in rural Puerto Rico.",2019,,P R Health Sci J,38,1,54-59,,,,#3900,Reyes 2019,,
Drug use stigma and its association with active hepatitis C virus infection and injection drug use behaviors among community-based people who inject drugs in India,"Patel, Eshan U.; Solomon, Sunil S.; Lucas, Gregory M.; McFall, Allison M.; Tomori, Cecília; Srikrishnan, Aylur K.; Kumar, Muniratnam S.; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Celentano, David D.; Thomas, David L.; Quinn, Thomas C.; Mehta, Shruti H.","BACKGROUND: Although drug use stigma is globally pervasive, quantitative evidence of its role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission is limited. We evaluated the psychometric properties of a drug use stigma scale and examined the association between drug use stigma and active HCV infection among a community-based sample of people who inject drugs (PWID) in India.METHODS: Between 8/2016 and 5/2017, a cross-sectional sample of PWID was recruited from 12 Indian cities (~1000/city) using respondent-driven sampling. Participants were ≥18 years old and reported injection drug use (IDU) in the past 2 years. Multivariable logistic regression with a random-intercept for each city was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of active HCV infection (RNA>30 IU/mL). Analyses incorporated RDS-II weights.RESULTS: Of 11,663 participants, 73.1% reported IDU in the past 6 months and 33.8% had active HCV infection. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a four-factor solution of enacted, vicarious, felt normative and internalized drug use stigma with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.85-0.92). In analyses adjusted for age, gender, northeast region, education, homelessness, incarceration, alcohol dependence, HIV status, frequency of IDU, and ever sharing needles/syringes, PWID reporting any enacted stigma had greater odds of active HCV infection (aOR = 1.27 [95% CI = 1.13-1.43]) as did PWID with internalized stigma scores in the highest quartile (vs. lowest quartile; aOR = 1.69 [95% CI = 1.11-2.56]). Among PWID who reported IDU in the past 6 months, multiple forms of stigma were associated with higher frequency of IDU, sharing needles/syringes, having multiple injection partners, and IDU in public spaces.CONCLUSION: Using a multidimensional drug use stigma scale, various forms of stigma were significantly associated with active HCV infection and injection drug use-related risk behaviors. Collectively, these data suggest that drug use stigma may play a role in HCV transmission and impede efforts to achieve HCV elimination. Strategies to diminish drug use stigma are warranted.",2021,,Int J Drug Policy,96,,103354,,10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103354,,#3901,Patel 2021,,
Male sexual assault: Physical injury and vulnerability in 103 presentations,"Zilkens, Renate R.; Smith, Debbie A.; Mukhtar, S. Aqif; Semmens, James B.; Phillips, Maureen A.; Kelly, Maire C.","OBJECTIVES: To i) describe the demographic and assault characteristics of males alleging recent sexual assault, ii) determine the severity and frequency of general body injury and the frequency of anal and genital injury, iii) identify vulnerability factors and assault characteristics associated with injury.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC), Western Australia.PARTICIPANTS: Total of 103 post-pubertal males attending SARC from Jan-2009 to Dec-2016.METHODS: Men underwent a standardised medical examination and data collection by forensically trained doctors following consent for general body and/or ano-genital examination. Men were considered vulnerable if at least one of the following factors was present: current mental illness; intellectual or physical disability; alcohol intoxication; previous sexual victimization; living in prison or homeless (no fixed address), aged < 18 years. Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher exact test. An algorithm was used to classify general body injuries as mild, moderate or severe.RESULTS: At least one vulnerability factor was present in 88.3% of the 103 men. More than one factor was present in 54.4%. General body injury was observed in 58.0% (40/69) of men consenting to general body examination; 46.4%, 10.1% and 1.4% were classified as having respectively, mild, moderate and severe injuries. Three assault characteristics were associated with general body injury: the use of blunt force (p = 0.002), multiple assailants (p = 0.049) and deprivation of liberty (p = 0.040). Genital injury and anal injury was observed in, respectively, 6.5% (5/77) and 14.3% (11/77) of men consenting to ano-genital examination. Of the 49 men examined following completed penetrative anal assault, 18.4% (9/49) had anal injuries. In these 49 men, those assaulted by strangers were more likely to have an anal injury compared to non-stranger assaults (p = 0.019). No demographic, clinical or vulnerability characteristics of the sexually assaulted men were associated with general body, genital and/or anal injury.CONCLUSION: Although general body injuries were more frequent than genital and anal injuries, most of the body injuries were mild in severity. While the majority of men in our study presented with one or more vulnerabilities only assault characteristics (not vulnerabilities) were associated with injury.",2018,,J Forensic Leg Med,58,,145-151,,10.1016/j.jflm.2018.05.009,,#3902,Zilkens 2018,,
Self-harm among the homeless population in Ireland: A national registry-based study of incidence and associated factors,"Barrett, Peter; Griffin, Eve; Corcoran, Paul; O'Mahony, Mary T.; Arensman, Ella","BACKGROUND: Self-harm is a strong predictor of future suicide, but little is known about self-harm among the homeless population. The study aim was to estimate the incidence of self-harm among the homeless population and to assess factors associated with self-harm.METHODS: Data on self-harm presentations to 34 hospital emergency departments in Ireland were collected by the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland (NSHRI). Index presentations between 2010 and 2014 were included for the homeless and fixed residence populations. Incidence rates of self-harm were calculated using NSHRI data and census estimates. Factors associated with self-harm and repeated self-harm were analysed by multivariable-adjusted logistic regression.RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate of self-harm was 30 times higher among the homeless (5572 presentations per 100,000) compared with those with a fixed residence (187 presentations per 100,000). Homeless people had significantly higher odds of being male (OR 1.86, 95%CI 1.56-2.23), presenting with self-cutting (vs. overdose, OR 2.15, 95%CI 1.74-2.66) and having psychiatric admission (vs. general admission, OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.66-3.57). Homeless people had higher odds of self-harm repetition within 12 months (vs. fixed residence, OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.21-1.77). The odds of repetition were significantly increased among homeless who engaged in self-cutting (vs. overdose, OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.17-2.65) and did not receive psychiatric review at index presentation (vs. reviewed, OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.05-2.26).LIMITATIONS: The study only reflects self-harm presenting to hospital, and assumes no change in homelessness status after index presentation. Residual confounding may affect the results.CONCLUSION: There is a disproportionate burden of self-harm among the homeless.

Smoking status and quit behaviors among health center patients with substance use disorders: A national study,"Fine, Danielle R.; Bearnot, Benjamin I.; Rigotti, Nancy A.; Baggett, Travis P.","BACKGROUND: Despite a high prevalence of smoking among individuals with substance use disorders, tobacco dependence in this vulnerable population is undertreated.METHODS: We analyzed data from 5592 adult (≥18 years old) respondents to the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of individuals who receive care at U.S. Federally Qualified Health Centers. We evaluated self-reported smoking status, smoking-related quit behaviors (having quit, wanting or attempting to quit in the past year, and planning to quit in the next 6 months), and receipt of advice to quit smoking among participants with and without alcohol use disorder (AUD) and drug use disorder (DUD).RESULTS: Current smoking was common among individuals with AUD (64.3%) and DUD (55.0%). Few patients with AUD or DUD had quit smoking (16.7% and 24.0%, respectively). Smokers with AUD had higher odds of wanting to quit smoking in the past year (adjusted odds ratio = 2.88; 95% confidence interval = 1.19, 7.05), but were not more likely to have made a past-year quit attempt. DUD was not significantly associated with smoking-related quit behaviors. Smokers with AUD or DUD, as well as those who engaged in treatment for AUD or DUD, did not differ significantly from other smokers in receipt of advice to quit smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Smokers with AUD and DUD were unlikely to have quit smoking despite interest in quitting. Our findings suggest a need for individualized tobacco treatment approaches in patients with AUD and DUD and missed opportunities to provide tobacco cessation counseling during addiction treatment.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend,202,,12-Jun,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.05.004,,#3904,Fine 2019,,
Housing First: Unsuppressed Viral Load Among Women Living with HIV in San Francisco,"Riley, Elise D.; Vittinghoff, Eric; Koss, Catherine A.; Christopoulos, Katerina A.; Clemenzi-Allen, Angelo; Dilworth, Samantha E.; Carrico, Adam W.","While poverty is an established barrier to achieving success at each step of the HIV care continuum, less is known about specific aspects of poverty and how they overlap with behavior in exceptionally low-income individuals who live in well-resourced areas. We considered unsuppressed viral load over 3 years among women living with HIV in San Francisco who used homeless shelters, low-income hotels and free meal programs. One-hundred twenty study participants were followed; 60% had > 1 unsuppressed viral load and 19% were unsuppressed at every visit. Across six-month intervals, the odds of unsuppressed viral load were 11% higher for every 10 nights spent sleeping on the street [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20]; 16% higher for every 10 nights spent sleeping in a shelter (AOR/10 nights 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.27); 4% higher for every 10 nights spent sleeping in a single-room occupancy hotel (AOR/10 nights 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07); and over threefold higher among women who experienced any recent incarceration (AOR 3.56, 95% CI 1.84-6.86). Violence and recent use of outpatient health care did not significantly predict viral suppression in adjusted analysis. While strategies to promote retention in care are important for vulnerable persons living with HIV, they are insufficient to ensure sustained viral suppression in low-income women experiencing homelessness and incarceration. Results presented here in combination with prior research linking incarceration to homelessness among women indicate that tailored interventions, which not only consider but prioritize affordable housing, are critical to achieving sustained viral suppression in low-income women living with HIV.",2019,,AIDS Behav,23,9,2326-2336,,10.1007/s10461-019-02601-w,,#3905,Riley 2019,,
Radiologic Findings in Intimate Partner Violence,"George, Elizabeth; Phillips, Catherine H.; Shah, Nandish; Lewis-O'Connor, Annie; Rosner, Bernard; Stoklosa, Hanni M.; Khurana, Bharti","Purpose To assess the radiologic findings associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). Materials and Methods Electronic medical records of 185 patients referred to the IPV support program from the emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 555 subjects (1:3 ratio of IPV victims to control subjects) who presented to the ED. Reports of all imaging studies performed within 5 years prior to the index ED visit were reviewed. Results The majority of patients who experienced IPV (mean age, 34.2 years ± 12.2 [standard deviation]) were female (178 of 185 [96.2%]) and were largely African American (69 of 185 [37.3%]). Demographic and clinical variables independently associated with IPV were race (odds ratio [OR] range, 3.2-5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8, 12.7), psychiatric comorbidities (OR, 5.4; 95% CI: 3.4, 8.8), and homelessness (OR, 13.0; 95% CI: 5.4, 31.2). IPV victims underwent more imaging studies in the preceding 5 years (median, four studies) than did control subjects (median, one study). Obstetric-gynecologic findings (OR, 4.4; 95% CI: 2.1, 9.6) and acute fractures (OR, 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.3) seen on images were independently associated with IPV. The addition of imaging findings to demographic and clinical variables increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the multivariate model to detect IPV (0.87 vs 0.86, P < .01), and the cross-validated multivariate model had an AUC of 0.85. Acute fractures involved the face or skull (range, P < .01 to P = .05), and chronic fractures affected the extremities and nasal bone (P < .01 and P = .05, respectively) more frequently in the IPV group than in the control group.

From peer-based to peer-led: redefining the role of peers across the hepatitis C care pathway: HepCare Europe,"Surey, Julian; Menezes, Dee; Francis, Marie; Gibbons, John; Sultan, Binta; Miah, Ala; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Story, Alistair","BACKGROUND: HCV infection disproportionately affects underserved populations such as homeless individuals, people who inject drugs and prison populations. Peer advocacy can enable active engagement with healthcare services and increase the likelihood of favourable treatment outcomes.OBJECTIVES: This observational study aims to assess the burden of disease in these underserved populations and describe the role of peer support in linking these individuals to specialist treatment services.METHODS: Services were identified if they had a high proportion of individuals with risk factors for HCV, such as injecting drug use or homelessness. Individuals were screened for HCV using point-of-care tests and a portable FibroScan. All positive cases received peer support for linkage to specialist care. Information was gathered on risk factors, demographics and follow-up information regarding linkage to care and treatment outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 461 individuals were screened, of which 197 (42.7%) were chronically infected with HCV. Referral was made to secondary care for 176 (89.3%) and all received peer support, with 104 (52.8%) individuals engaged with treatment centres. Of these, 89 (85.6%) started treatment and 76 (85.4%) had a favourable outcome. Factors associated with not being approved for treatment were recent homelessness, younger age and current crack cocaine injecting.CONCLUSIONS: Highly trained peer support workers working as part of a specialist outreach clinical team help to identify a high proportion of individuals exposed to HCV, achieve high rates of engagement with treatment services and maintain high rates of treatment success amongst a population with complex needs.",2019,,J Antimicrob Chemother,74,Suppl 5,v17-v23,,10.1093/jac/dkz452,,#3907,Surey 2019,,
Risk factors associated with sexually transmitted infections among women under community supervision in New York City,"Davis, Alissa; Goddard-Eckrich, Dawn; Dasgupta, Anindita; El-Bassel, Nabila","The number of women under community supervision in the United States has increased, and this population has a high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We examined STI prevalence and multiple risk factors among drug-involved women under community supervision in New York City. Data were from a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavioral HIV/STI intervention (Women on the Road to Health [WORTH]) among drug-involved women in the community corrections system in New York City from 2009 to 2012. To be eligible for inclusion, women had to be under community supervision within the past 90 days, have used illicit drugs at least once in the past six months, and have unprotected sex at least once in the past 90 days. Participants completed a survey containing items on STI risk factors and were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between risk factors and STI diagnosis. Of 333 women tested, 89 (26.7%) tested positive for an STI. Ten (3.0%) were positive for C. trachomatis, 4 (1.2%) for N. gonorrhoeae, and 77 (23.1%) for T. vaginalis. Women with any STI were more likely to be black (AOR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.08-3.77), homeless in the past 90 days (AOR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01-4.26), arrested in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.14-3.39), and have a greater number of sexual partners in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08-1.42). Drug-using women under community supervision have a high burden of STIs driven by multiple risk factors.

"Foster care, syndemic health disparities and associations with HIV/STI diagnoses among young adult substance users","Buttram, Mance E.; Pagano, Maria E.; Kurtz, Steven P.","OBJECTIVES: Foster care history is associated with many health and social problems, including sexual risk behaviours, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This cross-sectional study compares sexual risk behaviours among a sample of young adult substance users in Miami (N=602) with and without foster care histories.METHODS: Participants completed a comprehensive assessment which included sections on foster care, sexual risk behaviours and related health and social problems. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between foster care history, associated syndemic vulnerabilities and increased likelihood of having a prior HIV/STI diagnosis.RESULTS: Bivariate analyses indicated that foster care alumni were more likely to report a prior HIV/STI diagnosis, higher condomless sex frequencies, being high on alcohol or drugs during sex, sexual victimisation and a history of homelessness compared with other participants in the sample (p<0.05). Multivariate analyses revealed that foster care history, sexual victimisation and group sex participation are associated with a prior HIV/STI diagnosis (p<0.05). Group sex participation doubled the odds of a prior HIV/STI diagnosis for foster care alumni, compared with other participants (p<0.5).CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study identifies characteristics that distinguish foster care alumni from non-alumni and signals the need to better serve the sexual and related health needs of individuals with foster care histories. Clinicians and healthcare providers should provide foster care alumni with detailed HIV/STI risk reduction information and resources and services to address related syndemic vulnerabilities (eg, victimisation and homelessness).",2019,,Sex Transm Infect,95,3,175-180,,10.1136/sextrans-2017-053490,,#3909,Buttram 2019,,
Cigarette Smoking and Quitting-Related Factors Among US Adult Health Center Patients with Serious Mental Illness,"Kalkhoran, Sara; Thorndike, Anne N.; Rigotti, Nancy A.; Fung, Vicki; Baggett, Travis P.","INTRODUCTION: US adults with serious mental illness (SMI), compared to those without SMI, have a higher prevalence of smoking, which contributes to a shorter life expectancy. This study compared current smoking and quitting-related characteristics of low-income US adults with and without SMI who received healthcare at federally funded health centers.METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from adults ≥ 18 years old in the nationally representative 2014 Health Center Patient Survey (n = 5592), we compared the prevalence of ever and current smoking among adults with and without SMI and calculated quit ratios as the percentage of ever smokers who have quit smoking. We examined the association between SMI and receiving advice to quit, making quit attempts, and having plans to quit in the next 30 days using multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 1376 (23%) of participants had SMI. Ever smoking prevalence was 68% in adults with SMI and 41% in adults without SMI, and current smoking prevalence was 48% and 22%, respectively. The quit ratio was 30% and 46% among participants with and without SMI, respectively. Compared to smokers without SMI, more smokers with SMI reported receiving advice to quit in the past 12 months (aOR 2.47, 95% CI 1.20-5.07). Smokers with and without SMI did not differ significantly in their odds of having made a past-12-month quit attempt or plans to quit.CONCLUSIONS: Smokers with SMI seen in federally funded health centers were just as likely to have made a quit attempt and to have plans to quit as smokers without SMI. Despite a higher likelihood of receiving clinician advice to quit, the lower quit ratio in this population suggests that advice alone is unlikely to be sufficient. These results underscore the need for augmented strategies to promote smoking cessation and reduce the excess burden of tobacco-related disease in patients with SMI.",2019,,J Gen Intern Med,34,6,986-991,,10.1007/s11606-019-04857-3,,#3910,Kalkhoran 2019,,
Access to Healthcare and the Utilization of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Homeless Medicaid Patients 15 to 44 Years of Age,"Patel, Chirag G.; Williams, Samantha P.; Tao, Guoyu","Homelessness poses a direct threat to public health in the US as many individuals face debilitating health outcomes and barriers to adequate health care. Access to STI care for the homeless Medicaid population of USA has not been well-studied using administrative claims data. Our study aims to compare health services utilization, STI screening and diagnoses among people experiencing homelessness (PEH) vs. those who are non-PEH using ICD10 codes. We used 2019 MarketScan Medicaid claims data to analyze men and women aged 15-44 years with a diagnosis code for PEH (Z59.0), non-PEH (without Z59.0) and assessed their emergency department and outpatient visits and STI/HIV diagnoses and screening rates. We identified 5135 PEH men and 3571 PEH women among 1.3 million men and 2.1 million women in the 2019 US Medicaid database. PEH patients were more likely to have ED visits (94.80% vs 33.04%) and ≥ 20 outpatient clinic visits (60.29% vs 16.16%) than non-PEH patients in 2019. Higher diagnoses were observed for syphilis 1.57% (CI 1.32-1.86) vs 0.11% (CI 0.11-0.11), HIV 3.93% (CI 3.53-4.36) vs 0.41% (CI 0.41-0.42), chlamydia 1.94% (CI 1.66-2.25) vs 0.85% (CI 0.84-0.86) and gonorrhea 1.26% (CI 1.04-1.52) vs. 0.33% (CI 0.33-0.34) (p < 0.0001) among PEH compared to non-PEH. Among PEH, higher STI/HIV diagnoses rates indicate an increase in STI burden and suboptimal STI testing indicates an underutilization of STI services despite having a higher percentage of health care visits compared to non-PEH patients.

The incidence of ICU admissions in the H population, the characteristics of ICU-managed H, and factors associated with their short-term mortality were examined.RESULTS: Among 52,206 H hospitalizations 15,553 (29.8%) were admitted to ICU. The incidence of ICU admission among state H population rose between 2007 and 2014 from 28.0 to 96.6/1,000 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Adults aged ≥ 45 years and minorities accounted for 70.2% and 57.6%, respectively, of the growth in volume of ICU admissions. Short-term mortality was 3.2%, with odds of death increased with age, comorbidity burden, and number of failing organs.CONCLUSIONS: The demand for critical care services was increasingly high among the H and was contrasted by low short-term mortality among ICU admissions. These findings, coupled with the persistent health disparities among minority H, underscore the need to effectively address homelessness and reduce barriers to longitudinal appropriate prehospital care among the H.",2018,,Biomed Res Int,2018,,3869652,,10.1155/2018/3869652,,#3912,Oud 2018,,
"Clinical and epidemiological aspects of tuberculosis in the Federal District (Brazil, 2006 to 2015)","Rodrigues, Olga Maíra Machado; Tauil, Pedro Luiz","INTRODUCTION: Despite the low incidence rates of tuberculosis (TB) in the Federal District (FD), there are socioeconomic discrepancies allied to intense population growth in recent years, which demonstrates the need to study the trend of the disease in different regions of the FD.OBJECTIVE: To describe the trend of morbidity and mortality due to TB in the FD from 2006 to 2015.METHODS: Ecological study, with descriptive and analytical components, historical series type.RESULTS: There was a decreasing trend in incidence rates (IR) (from 15.1 per 100,000 inhabitants to 11.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, r = -0.50) and in the cure rate (from 86.0% to 74.7, r = -0.91); people experiencing homelessness and incarceration have relative risks from 5 to 16 times higher than the general population; higher IR were found in Paranoá (27.5 per 100,000 inhabitants) and in Estrutural (17.3 per 100,000 inhabitants), areas with poor socioeconomic indicators and demografic explosion during the study period. A higher mean lethality rate was found in Águas Claras (8.5%) and in Lago Sul (7.0%), regions that have a high concentration of homeless and elderly people.CONCLUSION: TB persists as an important public health problem in the FD, especially in impoverished areas, with significant population growth or a high concentration of elderly or vulnerable populations.",2019,,Rev Bras Epidemiol,22,,e190055,,10.1590/1980-549720190055,,#3913,Rodrigues 2019,,
Predictors for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Outcome and Adverse Events in an Italian Referral Hospital: A Nine-Year Retrospective Study (2013-2021),"Di Gennaro, Francesco; Lattanzio, Rossana; Guido, Giacomo; Ricciardi, Aurelia; Novara, Roberta; Patti, Giulia; Cotugno, Sergio; De Vita, Elda; Brindicci, Gaetano; Mariano, Michele Fabiano; Ronga, Luigi; Santoro, Carmen Rita; Romanelli, Federica; Stolfa, Stefania; Papagni, Roberta; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; De Iaco, Giusi; Saracino, Annalisa","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has undone years of progress in providing essential TB services and controlling the TB burden. Italy, a low TB burden country, has an incidence of 7.1 cases per 100,000 people. To control the TB spreading in Italy is critical to investigate the characteristics of patients with the worst outcomes and the highest risk of adverse events related to antituberculosis therapy. Therefore, we conducted a large retrospective study in TB patients admitted to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases University of Bari, Italy, in order to describe the clinical presentation and the factors associated with adverse events and outcomes.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the patients admitted to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases from January 2013 to 15 December 2021. We stratified our cohort into two groups: <65 years of age and ≥65 years in order to assess any differences between the two groups. Two logistic regression models were implemented considering the dependent variables as: (I) the adverse events; and (II) the unsuccessful treatments.RESULTS: In total, 206 consecutive patients [60% (n = 124) M, median age 39 years, range 16-92] were diagnosed and admitted with TB at Clinic of Infectious Diseases. Of the whole sample, 151 (74%) were <65 years and 55 (26%) were ≥65. Statistically significant differences between the two groups were detected (p-value < 0.05) for nationality (p-value = 0.01), previous contact with TB patient (p-value = 0.00), type of TB (p-value = 0.00), unsuccessful treatment (p-value = 0.00), length of hospitalization (p-value = 0.02) and diagnostic delay (p-value = 0.01). Adverse events related to TB drug regimen were reported in 24% (n = 49). Age < 65 years (O.R. = 3.91; 95% CI 1.72-4.21), non-Italian nationality (O.R. = 4.45; 95% CI 2.22-4.98.), homeless (O.R. = 3.23; 95% CI 2.58-4.54), presence of respiratory symptoms (O.R. = 1.23; 95% CI 1.10-1.90), diagnostic delay (O.R = 2.55; 95% CI 1.98-3.77) resulted associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome (death, failure or lost to follow up). Finally, age < 65 years (O.R. = 1.73; 95% CI 1.31-2.49), presence of pulmonary TB (O.R. = 1.15; 95% CI 1.02-1.35), length of hospitalization (O.R. = 1.82; 95% CI 1.35-2.57) and TB culture positive (O.R. = 1.35; 95% CI 1.12-1.82) were associated with adverse events in our populations.CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacological approach alone seems insufficient to treat and cure a disease whose ethiopathogenesis is not only due to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also to the poverty or the social fragility. Our data suggest that young foreigners, the homeless, and the people with low social and economic status are at higher risk of an unfavorable outcome in low incidence TB countries. Targeted actions to support this highly vulnerable population both in terms of outcome and occurrence of adverse events are needed.",2022,,Ann Glob Health,88,1,26,,10.5334/aogh.3677,,#3914,DiGennaro 2022,,
Non-fatal opioid-related overdoses among adolescents in Massachusetts 2012-2014,"Chatterjee, Avik; Larochelle, Marc R.; Xuan, Ziming; Wang, Na; Bernson, Dana; Silverstein, Michael; Hadland, Scott E.; Land, Thomas; Samet, Jeffrey H.; Walley, Alexander Y.; Bagley, Sarah M.","BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdoses and deaths among adolescents in the United States continue to increase, but little is known about adolescents who experience opioid-related non-fatal overdose (NFOD). Our objective was to describe (1) the characteristics of adolescents aged 11-17 who experienced NFOD and (2) their receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the 12 months following NFOD, compared with adults.METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort using six Massachusetts state agency datasets linked at the individual level, with information on 98% of state residents. Individuals entered the cohort if they experienced NFOD between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. We compared adolescents to adults experiencing NFOD, examining individual characteristics and receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone.RESULTS: Among 22,506 individuals who experienced NFOD during the study period, 195 (0.9%) were aged 11-17. Fifty-two percent (102/195) of adolescents were female, whereas only 38% of adults were female (P < 0.001). In the year prior to NFOD, 11% (21/195) of adolescents received a prescription opioid, compared to 43% of adults (P < 0.001), and <5% (<10/195) received any MOUD compared to 23% of adults (P < 0.001). In the 12 months after NFOD, only 8% (15/195) of adolescents received MOUD, compared to 29% of adults.CONCLUSION: Among individuals experiencing NFOD, adolescents were more likely to be female and less likely to have been prescribed opioids in the year prior. Few adolescents received MOUD before or after NFOD.

Explaining racial and ethnic disparities in antiretroviral therapy adherence and viral suppression among U.S. men who have sex with men,"Patel, Deesha; Beer, Linda; Yuan, Xin; Tie, Yunfeng; Baugher, Amy R.; Jeffries, William L.; Dailey, Andre; Henny, Kirk D.; Medical Monitoring Project","OBJECTIVE: To identify factors - including social determinants of health (SDOH) - that explain racial/ethnic disparities in antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and sustained viral suppression (SVS) among U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV.DESIGN: We used weighted data from 2017-2021 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project.METHODS: Among MSM taking ART, we calculated prevalence differences (PDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ART adherence (100% ART adherence, past 30 days) and SVS (all viral loads in past 12 months <200 copies/ml or undetectable) for Black MSM (BMSM) and Hispanic/Latino MSM (HMSM) compared with White MSM (WMSM). Using forward stepwise selection, we calculated adjusted PDs with 95% CIs to examine if controlling for selected variables reduced PDs.RESULTS: After adjusting for age, any unmet service need, federal poverty level (FPL), food insecurity, homelessness, time since HIV diagnosis, gap in health coverage, and education, the BMSM/WMSM PD for ART adherence reduced from -16.9 to -8.2 (51.5%). For SVS, the BMSM/WMSM PD reduced from -8.3 to -3.6 (56.6%) after adjusting for ART adherence, age, homelessness, food insecurity, gap in health coverage, FPL, any unmet service need, time since diagnosis, and ER visit(s). The HMSM/WMSM PD for ART adherence reduced from -9.3 to -2.9 (68.8%) after adjusting for age and FPL. The unadjusted HMSM/WMSM PD for SVS was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting for SDOH and other factors greatly reduced racial/ethnic disparities in ART adherence and SVS.

"Housing status and accidental substance-related acute toxicity deaths in Canada, 2016-2017","VanSteelandt, Amanda; Abele, Brandi; Ahmad, Raahyma; Enns, Aganeta; Jackson, Beth; Kakkar, Tanya; Kouyoumdjian, Fiona","INTRODUCTION: There is a complex relationship between housing status and substance use, where substance use reduces housing opportunities and being unhoused increases reasons to use substances, and the associated risks and stigma.METHODS: In this descriptive analysis of people without housing who died of accidental substance-related acute toxicity in Canada, we used death investigation data from a national chart review study of substance-related acute toxicity deaths in 2016 and 2017 to compare sociodemographic factors, health histories, circumstances of death and substances contributing to death of people who were unhoused and people not identified as unhoused, using Pearson chi-square test. The demographic distribution of people who died of acute toxicity was compared with the 2016 Nationally Coordinated Point-In-Time Count of Homelessness in Canadian Communities and the 2016 Census.RESULTS: People without housing were substantially overrepresented among those who died of acute toxicity in 2016 and 2017 (8.9% versus <1% of the overall population). The acute toxicity event leading to death of people without housing occurred more often in an outdoor setting (24%); an opioid and/or stimulant was identified as contributing to their death more frequently (68%-82%; both contributed in 59% of their deaths); and they were more frequently discharged from an institution in the month before their death (7%).CONCLUSION: We identified several potential opportunities to reduce acute toxicity deaths among people who are unhoused, including during contacts with health care and other institutions, through harm reduction supports for opioid and stimulant use, and by creating safer environments for people without housing.",2024,,Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can,44,8-Jul,319-330,,10.24095/hpcdp.44.7/8.03,,#3917,VanSteelandt 2024,,
"Risk for Substance Use Disorders in young adulthood: Associations with developmental experiences of homelessness, foster care, and adverse childhood experiences","Moss, Howard B.; Ge, Shaokui; Trager, Evan; Saavedra, Madeline; Yau, Margaret; Ijeaku, Ijeoma; Deas, Deborah","BACKGROUND: Multiple developmental risk factors for Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) during young adulthood have been identified. In this investigation, we examined the impact of homelessness, foster care, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) prior to 12th grade on the development of three common SUDs during young adulthood-Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). Our hypothesis was that while both homelessness and ACEs are significant risk factors for young adult SUDs, foster care involvement might convey protection.METHODS: Using nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, measures of ACEs were derived from the CDC-Kaiser ACE study, and DSM-V SUD diagnoses were derived from items originally based on DSM-IV. SUD diagnoses were binned into ""mild"", ""moderate"", and ""severe"" groupings. Survey-based logistic models were used to estimate risks of SUDs while controlling for demographics.RESULTS: The results suggest that the experience of homelessness prior to 12th grade in addition to ACEs were significantly associated with the development in young adulthood of the most severe forms of AUD and TUD and all severity levels of CUD. Foster care was not associated with either risk or protection from SUDs.CONCLUSIONS: The experience of homelessness during development may be viewed as another detrimental ACE that is a risk factor for the most common SUDs in young adulthood. Given the magnitude of the current epidemic of homelessness in the U.S., these results should raise substantial concern.",2020,,Compr Psychiatry,100,,152175,,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152175,,#3918,Moss 2020,,
Tuberculosis transmission in the population of patients from the Krakow Region (Poland) based on the epidemiological and molecular methods,"Kruczak, Katarzyna; Augustynowicz-Kopeć, Ewa; Kozińska, Monika; Passak-Stańda, Grażyna; Niżankowska-Mogilnicka, Ewa; Sładek, Krzysztof","BACKGROUND: The transmission of tuberculosis may affect the incidence rate of the disease in Poland. Genetic methods are of assistance in tracing the infection transmission, identifying its sources, determining the risk groups, and focusing on the preventive actions.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study lie in an assessment of tuberculosis transmission by genetic methods with the assistance of the standard epidemiologic interview.METHODS: The genome DNA of 275 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains from tuberculosis patients, inhabitants of the city of Krakow, was subjected to a genetic analysis via the spoligotyping method and the IS6110-Mtb1-Mtb2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. If the DNA profiles were identical in both of the PCRs, they were considered identical and classified within one molecular family.RESULTS: Among 275 strains, 104 genetic patterns (spoligotypes) were identified. Two hundred and three strains were divided into 66 molecular families (clusters) and analyzed with the IS6110- Mtb1-Mtb2 PCR method. Eighteen clusters were separated. In the Mtb1-Mtb2 clusters, 21 patients were in the risk groups (the homeless, prisoners, and nursing home residents). We did not confirm any direct or temporary contacts between the patients constituting the Mtb1-Mtb2 clusters (apart from the risk groups). However, the patients in these clusters often lived in the same parts of Krakow.CONCLUSIONS: The standard epidemiologic interview in tuberculosis patients should be combined with genetic methods. Active transmission of tuberculosis occurs largely among the individuals maintaining probably periodic contacts. The patients who are in the risk groups may play an important role in the transmission of tuberculosis.",2019,,Int J Mycobacteriol,8,1,60-69,,10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_11_19,,#3919,Kruczak 2019,,
Delay in health-care-seeking treatment among tuberculosis patients in Japan: what are the implications for control in the era of universal health coverage?,"Yoshikawa, Reina; Kawatsu, Lisa; Uchimura, Kazuhiro; Ohkado, Akihiro","OBJECTIVE: To study the trends in and risk factors for patient delay (the time from the onset of symptoms to the initial doctor visit) in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) using three temporal categories - short (2 weeks to < 2 months), medium (2 months to < 6 months) and long (≥ 6 months) - and discuss implications for social protection measures.METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted by analysing Japanese TB surveillance data from patients with symptomatic PTB registered between 2007 and 2017 (n = 88 351).RESULTS: While the proportion of patients with short delay has decreased significantly (P < 0.001), the proportions of those with medium or long delays have decreased slightly (P = 0.0015 and P < 0.001, respectively). Not having health insurance, receiving public assistance, being a temporary worker, and having a history of homelessness were some of the risks identified for patient delay. Being male and working full-time were two risks specifically associated with long delay (for males, the adjusted odds ratio = 1.17, P < 0.05; for being a full-time worker, the adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, P < 0.05).DISCUSSION: Despite the implementation of universal health coverage decades ago, patient delay remains a challenge in Japan.

Given prevalent substance use among our sample, we explored whether four structural conditions indicative of social marginalisation and previously correlated with increased risk for HIV infection demonstrated syndemic (additive/synergistic) effects on: (i) HIV viral suppression; and (ii) self-reported involvement in sexual HIV transmission behaviours among a prospective cohort mostly comprising men of colour who have sex with men (MCSM; i.e. Latino/Hispanic and African American/black men) in Los Angeles County.DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected between August 2014 and March 2017. The structural conditions of interest were: current unemployment, recent (≤6 months) incarceration history, 'unstable' accommodation (past month) and remote (>6 months) contact with health-care providers. Generalised estimating equations assessed possible additive effects of experiencing multiple structural conditions, and possible synergistic effects on the HIV-related outcomes.RESULTS: Of 428 participants, nearly half (49%) were HIV-positive at baseline. Involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours varied over follow-up (22-30%). Reporting ≥2 structural syndemic conditions was significantly associated with reporting sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among HIV-negative participants, and detectable viral load among HIV-positive participants. Frequent methamphetamine use was consistently associated with the HIV-related outcomes across the final multivariate models.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: When developing initiatives to address HIV transmission among marginalised sub-populations including MCSM, we must holistically consider systemic and structural issues (e.g. unemployment and homelessness), especially in the context of prevalent substance use.",2020,,Drug Alcohol Rev,39,2,116-127,,10.1111/dar.13026,,#3921,Quinn 2020,,
The 'invisible homeless' - challenges faced by families bringing up their children in a remote Australian Aboriginal community,"Lowell, Anne; Maypilama, Ḻäwurrpa; Fasoli, Lyn; Guyula, Yalŋarra; Guyula, Abbey; Yunupiŋu, Megan; Godwin-Thompson, Jenine; Gundjarranbuy, Rosemary; Armstrong, Emily; Garrutju, Jane; McEldowney, Rose","BACKGROUND: Insufficient and inadequate housing remain serious and enduring problems in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. Housing is recognised as a key determinant of persisting inequities between Aboriginal and other Australians in health, as well as education and employment outcomes which in turn impact on health. In our qualitative study exploring strengths and challenges related to early childhood in a remote NT community, insufficient housing emerged as the greatest challenge families experience in 'growing up' their children.METHODS: The ""Growing up children in two worlds"" study engaged Yolŋu (Aboriginal) and other researchers in a culturally responsive qualitative research process. Methods included video ethnography and in-depth interviews with six case study families as well as participant observation and interviews with a wide range of other community members. Data collection and analysis occurred through an iterative and collaborative process and the findings related to housing are the focus of this article.RESULTS: Concerns about crowded and insecure housing were pervasive in the study community where many families are, in effect, homeless. Most rely on extended family to provide accommodation and some never find a secure and stable space in which to bring up their children. Absence of control over their living conditions is a key element underlying many of the sources of distress associated with crowded housing. The lack of food security, sharing sickness and disturbances in the night affecting sleep are just some of the challenges that generate conflict between family members and impact on health, wellbeing, work and school attendance. Although interaction with other family members is highly valued, the ambition of most participants is for independent and secure accommodation in which they can safely 'grow up' their children.CONCLUSIONS: Yolŋu who live with the consequences of crowded and insecure housing want their voices to be heard. They best understand the challenges they face and their perspectives must inform the solutions. Equitable access to housing through sufficient and sustained investment in an integrated approach, engaging all stakeholders, is needed. This is essential to address persisting inequities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in health and other outcomes.",2018,,BMC Public Health,18,1,1382,,10.1186/s12889-018-6286-8,,#3922,Lowell 2018,,

Identifying regions where suicide rates are elevated and increasing among AANHPI Veterans would inform targeted prevention efforts for members of this cohort. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of 377,833 AANHPI Veterans to examine suicide rates and methods (2005-2019) by United States (US) region and over time (2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2019), using US Veteran Eligibility Trends and Statistics and Joint DoD/VA Mortality Data Repository data. AANHPI Veterans across most regions experienced increases in suicide rates from the earliest to latest period; however, patterns differed by region. Age-adjusted suicide rates increased across all three periods among those in the Northeast and West, but increased, then declined in the Midwest and South. In 2015-2019, the age-adjusted suicide rate among AANHPI Veterans was highest in the Northeast (42.0 per 100,000) and lowest in the West (27.5). However, the highest percentages of AANHPI Veteran suicide deaths in 2005-2019 occurred in the West (39.5%) and South (34.7%), with lower percentages in the Midwest (15.0%) and Northeast (10.8%). Across regions, those ages 18-34 had the highest suicide rates. Firearms were the most frequently used suicide method across regions (44.4%-60.2%), except the Northeast (35.2%), where suffocation was more common (38.3%).

"Performance of centralized versus decentralized tuberculosis treatment services in Southern Brazil, 2006-2015","Scheffer, Mara Cristina; Prim, Rodrigo Ivan; Wildner, Leticia Muraro; Medeiros, Taiane Freitas; Maurici, Rosemeri; Kupek, Emil; Bazzo, Maria Luiza","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) control programs face the challenges of decreasing incidence, mortality rates, and drug resistance while increasing treatment adherence. The Brazilian TB control program recommended the decentralization of patient care as a strategy for combating the disease. This study evaluated the performance of this policy in an area with high default rates, comparing epidemiological and operational indicators between two similar municipalities.METHODS: This study analyzed epidemiological and operational indicators on new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis reported in the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System between 2006 and 2015. In addition, to characterize differences between the populations of the two studied municipalities, a prospective cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2015, in which patients with new cases of culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis were interviewed and monitored until the disease outcome. A descriptive analysis, the chi-square test, and a Poisson regression model were employed to compare TB treatment outcomes and health care indicators between the municipalities.RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred nine cases were evaluated, of which 207 patients were interviewed. Over the 2006-2015 period, TB incidence per 100,000 population in the municipality with decentralized care was significantly higher (39%, 95% CI 27-49%) in comparison to that of the municipality with centralized care. TB treatment default rate (45%, 95% CI 12-90%) was also higher in the municipality with decentralized care. During the two-year follow-up, significant differences were found between patients in centralized care and those in decentralized care regarding treatment success (84.5 vs. 66.1%), treatment default (10.7 vs. 25.8%), illicit drug use (27.7 vs. 45.9%), and homelessness (3.6 vs. 12.9%). The operational indicators revealed that the proportion of control smear tests, medical imaging, and HIV tests were all significantly higher in the centralized care. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients started treatment in the early stages of the disease in the municipality with decentralized care.CONCLUSIONS: These data showed a low success rate in TB treatment in both municipalities.

COVID-19 Susceptibility and Outcomes Among People Living With HIV in San Francisco,"Sachdev, Darpun; Mara, Elise; Hsu, Ling; Scheer, Susan; Rutherford, George; Enanoria, Wayne; Gandhi, Monica","INTRODUCTION: Studies to examine whether HIV predisposes to a higher incidence of COVID-19 or more severe disease are accumulating. Initial studies from New York City suggested more severe disease among people living with HIV (PLWH), but this was during a time when hospitals were over-capacity and health systems stretched. This report presents the incidence and outcomes among PLWH with COVID-19 in San Francisco over the first 6 months of the pandemic.METHODS: Community transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in San Francisco on March 5, 2020. This report examines the match of the San Francisco Department of Public Health COVID-19 testing database and the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIV Surveillance case registry from March 24, 2020, to September 3, 2020.RESULTS: Among 4252 COVID-19 tests performed among PLWH, 4.5% (N = 193) were positive for COVID-19, compared with a 3.5% (N = 9626) positivity rate among the 272,555 people without HIV tested for COVID-19 (P < 0.001). The mean age of those infected with HIV/COVID-19 was 48 years (20-76), 38.9% White, 38.3% Latinx, 11.9% Black, and 91.2% were men. Only 54.6% of coinfected PLWH were housed, with the remainder marginally housed. The rate of severe illness with COVID-19 was not increased among PLWH.DISCUSSION: In San Francisco, susceptibility to COVID-19 was increased among PLWH over the first 6 months of the pandemic, although clinical outcomes were similar to those without HIV. Homelessness and higher rates of congregate living situations among PLWH likely accounted for this disparity. Special efforts to house patients with marginal housing during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.",2021,,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,86,1,19-21,,10.1097/QAI.0000000000002531,,#3926,Sachdev 2021,,
Trauma in adults experiencing homelessness,"Miller, Jean-Philippe; O' Reilly, Gerard M.; Mackelprang, Jessica L.; Mitra, Biswadev","BACKGROUND: Homeless individuals suffer a greater burden of health problems than the general population. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of physical trauma among homeless patients presenting to an urban major trauma center and to ascertain any differences in the nature, injury severity and outcomes among homeless compared to domiciled patients.METHODS: A retrospective matched cohort study that included adults who met inclusion criteria for The Alfred Hospital Trauma Registry between 01 July 2010 and 31 March 2017 was conducted. Primary homelessness was identified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision Coding Z59.0 and/or 'No fixed abode' address data. Homeless and domiciled patients were matched at a 1:2 ratio on age, sex, month and year of injury. The primary outcome variable was the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, emergency department (ED) disposition, hospital disposition, discharge processes and trauma registry recidivism.RESULTS: Of 25,920 cases in the trauma registry, 147 (0.6%) were identified as homeless, comprising 131 unique homeless individuals who were matched with 262 domiciled patients. The median (Inter-Quartile Range) ISS among homeless patients was 5(2-10), compared to 9(4-17) for domiciled patients (p < 0.001). Homeless patients had significantly lower odds of sustaining an injury with ISS>12 (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, p = 0.001). Homeless patients were treated more often than domiciled patients for assault (32.1% vs 9.5%), intentional self-harm (10.7% vs 2.7%), and penetrating injury (16.0% vs 6.5%). Homeless patients had higher rates of psychiatry admissions (9.2% vs 0.8%), positive blood alcohol concentration (30.5% vs 13.7%), and higher odds of discharging against medical advice (DAMA)(OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.6 p = 0.02). There were no differences in LOS (p = 0.51), mortality (p = 0.19), ED disposition (p = 0.64) or trauma registry recidivism (p = 0.09).CONCLUSION: Among injured patients who presented at an urban trauma center, homelessness was associated with higher odds of assault, intentional self-harm, penetrating injury, psychiatry admissions, DAMA but lower ISS than domiciled patients. Variable definitions of homelessness and lack of standardized documentation in the medical record should be addressed to ensure these vulnerable patients are identified and linked with peripheral services.",2020,,Injury,51,4,897-905,,10.1016/j.injury.2020.02.086,,#3927,Miller 2020,,
"Patterns of Antibiotic Nonsusceptibility Among Invasive Group A Streptococcus Infections-United States, 2006-2017","Fay, Katherine; Onukwube, Jennifer; Chochua, Sopio; Schaffner, William; Cieslak, Paul; Lynfield, Ruth; Muse, Alison; Smelser, Chad; Harrison, Lee H.; Farley, Monica; Petit, Susan; Alden, Nisha; Apostal, Mirasol; Snippes Vagnone, Paula; Nanduri, Srinivas; Beall, Bernard; Van Beneden, Chris A.","BACKGROUND: Treatment of severe group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections requires timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy. We describe the epidemiology of antimicrobial-resistant invasive GAS (iGAS) infections in the United States (US).METHODS: We analyzed population-based iGAS surveillance data at 10 US sites from 2006 through 2017. Cases were defined as infection with GAS isolated from normally sterile sites or wounds in patients with necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. GAS isolates were emm typed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using broth microdilution or whole genome sequencing. We compared characteristics among patients infected with erythromycin-nonsusceptible (EryNS) and clindamycin-nonsusceptible (CliNS) strains to those with susceptible infections. We analyzed proportions of EryNS and CliNS among isolates by site, year, risk factors, and emm type.RESULTS: Overall, 17 179 iGAS cases were reported; 14.5% were EryNS. Among isolates tested for both inducible and constitutive CliNS (2011-2017), 14.6% were CliNS. Most (99.8%) CliNS isolates were EryNS. Resistance was highest in 2017 (EryNS: 22.8%; CliNS: 22.0%). All isolates were susceptible to β-lactams. EryNS and CliNS infections were most frequent among persons aged 18-34 years and in persons residing in long-term care facilities, experiencing homelessness, incarcerated, or who injected drugs. Patterns varied by site. Patients with nonsusceptible infections were significantly less likely to die. The emm types with >30% EryNS or CliNS included types 77, 58, 11, 83, and 92.CONCLUSIONS: Increasing prevalence of EryNS and CliNS iGAS infections in the US is predominantly due to expansion of several emm types.

"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Neighborhood Residency and Satisfaction, and Social Network Characteristics among Underserved Women in Baltimore, Maryland","Jain, Kriti M.; Davey-Rothwell, Melissa; Crossnohere, Norah L.; Latkin, Carl A.","BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence is high, but not well-understood, among women living in urban, impoverished areas. Although previous studies have established social support as an important factor in PTSD development and maintenance, little is known about how perceptions of neighborhood are linked to PTSD. This study examined the relationship between PTSD and social network and neighborhood factors among women with a low socioeconomic status.METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data collected from a human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted infection peer network study in Baltimore, Maryland (n = 438). We used bivariate analyses to examine the associations between PTSD and social network characteristics and time in neighborhood and satisfaction. We then constructed multivariable regression models that controlled for the following with PTSD: homelessness, cocaine/heroin use, and unemployment.MAIN FINDINGS: Overall, 30% of women had PTSD symptom severity consistent with a clinical diagnosis. In the multivariable model, dissatisfaction with neighborhood block (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; p = .03) and living in one's neighborhood for more than 5 years (OR, 1.69; p = .03) were associated with PTSD. Social network factors that were significantly associated with PTSD included a higher number of network members in conflict with the participant (OR, 1.28; p = .02), presence of a network member who would let the participant stay with them (OR, 0.4; p = .004), and the number of network members with whom the participant socialized (OR, 0.6; p = .04).CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of impoverished urban women with a high prevalence of PTSD, duration of residency, satisfaction with neighborhood, and network characteristics were found to be strongly associated with PTSD symptom severity.",2018,,Womens Health Issues,28,3,273-280,,10.1016/j.whi.2018.02.004,,#3929,Jain 2018,,

Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared according to hospitalization outcome (self-discharge, formal discharge, or death). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for the association of self-discharge with explanatory variables were estimated using Cox regression.RESULTS: Of the 1429 hospitalizations, 10.4% ended in self-discharge. Female sex (HR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.03;2.11), age ≤ 42 years (HR = 2.01; 95%CI 1.38; 2.93), substance use (HR = 1.62; 95%CI 1.12; 2.34), hospitalization after treatment dropout (HR = 2.04; 95%CI 1.37; 3.04), and homelessness (HR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.69; 3.69) were associated with self-discharge.CONCLUSION: Patients with social vulnerability require more careful monitoring during hospitalization.MAIN RESULTS: Homeless people, illicit drug use, female sex and history of dropout from previous treatment showed association with hospital self-discharge in patients with tuberculosis admitted to a reference hospital in the state of Rio de Janeiro.IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Need for more comprehensive support for vulnerable patients, in addition to promoting treatment adherence and training health professionals to deal with the complex psychosocial issues related to tuberculosis.PERSPECTIVES: It is crucial to develop public policies that consider social factors in tuberculosis management, as well as promoting cooperation and multisectoral approaches to address both tuberculosis and underlying social issues.",2024,,Epidemiol Serv Saude,33,,e20231202,,10.1590/S2237-96222024v33e20231202.en,,#3931,Bhering 2024,,

G.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the yield of tuberculosis (TB) and the prevalence of Human Immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) among key populations in the selected hotspot towns of Ethiopia.METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional implementation research during August 2017-January 2018. Trained TB focal persons and health extension workers (HEWs) identified female sex workers (FSWs), health care workers (HCWs), prison inmates, homeless, internally displaced people (IDPs), internal migratory workers (IMWs) and residents in missionary charities as key and vulnerable popuaiton. They carried out health education on the importance of TB screening and HIV testing prior to recruitment of the study participants. Symptomatic TB screening and HIV testing was done. The yield of TB was computed per 100,000 background key population.RESULTS: A total of 1878 vulnerable people were screened, out of which 726 (38.7%) presumptive TB cases and 87 (4.6%) TB cases were identified. The yield of TB was 1519 (95% CI: 1218.1-1869.9). The highest proportion (19.5%) and yield of TB case (6,286 (95% CI: 3980.8-9362.3)) was among HCWs. The prevalence of HIV infection was 6%, 67 out of 1,111 tested. IMWs and FSWs represented 49.3% (33) and 28.4% (13) of the HIV infections, respectively. There was a statistically significant association of active TB cases with previous history of TB (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 11 95% CI, 4.06-29.81), HIV infection (AOR: 7.7 95% CI, 2.24-26.40), and being a HCW (AOR: 2.42 95% CI, 1.09-5.34).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TB in key populations was nine times higher than 164/100,000 national estimated prevalence rate. The prevalence of HIV was five times higher than 1.15% of the national survey. The highest yield of TB was among the HCWs and the high HIV burden was detected among the FSWs and IMWs.

Not discussed: Inequalities in narrative text data for suicide deaths in the National Violent Death Reporting System,"Mezuk, Briana; Kalesnikava, Viktoryia A.; Kim, Jenni; Ko, Tomohiro M.; Collins, Cassady","BACKGROUND: The rate of suicide in the US has increased substantially in the past two decades, and new insights are needed to support prevention efforts. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the nation's most comprehensive registry of suicide mortality, has qualitative text narratives that describe salient circumstances of these deaths. These texts have great potential for providing novel insights about suicide risk but may be subject to information bias.OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between decedent characteristics and the presence and length of NVDRS text narratives (separately for coroner/medical examiner (C/ME) and law enforcement (LE) reports) among 233,108 suicide and undetermined deaths from 2003-2017.METHODS: Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic and quasi-Poisson modeling was used to examine variation in the narratives (proportion of missing texts and character length of the non-missing texts, respectively) as a function of decedent age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, military history, and homeless status. Models adjusted for site, year, location of death, and autopsy status.RESULTS: The frequency of missing narratives was higher for LE vs. C/ME texts (19.8% vs. 5.2%). Decedent characteristics were not consistently associated with missing text across the two types of narratives (i.e., Black decedents were more likely to be missing the LE narrative but less likely to be missing the C/ME narrative relative to non-Hispanic whites). Conditional on having a narrative, C/ME were significantly longer than LE (822.44 vs. 780.68 characters). Decedents who were older, male, had less education and some racial/ethnic minority groups had shorter narratives (both C/ME and LE) than younger, female, more educated, and non-Hispanic white decedents.CONCLUSION: Decedent characteristics are significantly related to the presence and length of narrative texts for suicide and undetermined deaths in the NVDRS. Findings can inform future research using these data to identify novel determinants of suicide mortality.",2021,,PLoS One,16,7,e0254417,,10.1371/journal.pone.0254417,,#3933,Mezuk 2021,,
Medical complications of homelessness: a neglected side of men's health,"Brown, Mark A.; Gellatley, Wendy; Hoffman, Anna; Dowdell, Lisa; Camac, Anne; Francois, Rachel; Boston, Belinda; Zekry, Amany","BACKGROUND: Homelessness is an increasing societal and health issue associated with high rates of substance abuse and mental health disorders. Homeless people die more often and at a younger age than others.AIM: To identify health needs and improve healthcare for homeless men.METHODS: A physician-led clinic was established on-site at the Mission Australia Centre in Sydney, incorporating: (i) liver screening, including portable fibroscan testing, and on-site treatment of hepatitis C; (ii) a mental health clinic, staffed by a psychiatrist; and (iii) a nurse-led clinic to follow up medical issues and deliver vaccinations. Patient data were recorded prospectively to determine what medical problems were encountered so as to drive future healthcare planning.RESULTS: A total of 257 men was assessed between November 2011 and December 2017. In that time, 561 men resided at the Centre. Of these 257 men who attended the clinic, 61% were <45 years old; 69% were current and 8% former smokers; 62% had a history of chronic alcoholic abuse and 66% other substance abuse; 64% had one or more of depression, anxiety, psychosis or another mental health disorder and 44% had metabolic syndrome features, 38% cardiovascular disease, 29% hepatitis C and 21% a respiratory disorder.CONCLUSION: The main health needs of homeless men fall into the categories of mental health; cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disorders and addictions and hepatitis C.

Social and structural factors associated with greater time with a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load above log10(1500) copies/ml among illicit drug users,"Kennedy, Mary Clare; Kerr, Thomas H.; Wood, Evan; Shoveller, Jeannie A.; Montaner, Julio S. G.; Milloy, M.-J. S.","OBJECTIVES: Although previous cross-sectional studies have identified correlates of detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) among HIV-positive people who use drugs (PWUD), longitudinal factors associated with heightened HIV transmission potential have not been well described. Therefore, we longitudinally examined factors associated with amount of person-time spent above log10(1500) copies/ml plasma among HIV-positive PWUD in Vancouver, Canada.DESIGN: Data were derived from a long-running prospective cohort of HIV-positive PWUD linked to comprehensive clinical records including systematic VL monitoring.METHODS: We used generalized estimating equations modeling to longitudinally examine factors associated with person-time (in days) with a VL more than log10(1500) copies/ml plasma in the previous 180 days.RESULTS: Between December 2005 and May 2014, 845 PWUD were eligible and included in the study. Participants spent an average of 26.8% of observation time with a VL more than log10(1500) copies/ml. In multivariable analyses, homelessness (Adjusted Rate Ratio [ARR] = 1.45) and lack of social support (ARR = 1.27) were positively associated with person-time with a VL more than log10(1500) copies/ml. Older age (ARR = 0.97) and enrolment in addiction treatment (ARR = 0.75) were negatively associated with the outcome in multivariable analyses (all P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Social and structural factors, including periods of homelessness or lacking in social support, were independently associated with greater amount of time with heightened HIV transmission potential.

This study aims to (1) estimate the rates of opioid-related overdoses, (2) estimate the association of benzodiazepine co-ingestion with opioid-related deaths, (3) estimate associations between socioeconomic indicators and opioid-related deaths, and (4) map the distribution of fatal overdoses, in Orange County (OC), California. Methods: An ecologic study was conducted of all opioid- related deaths (1205 total) from 2010 to 2014 obtained from the OC Coroner Division database (1065 OC residents, 55 nonresidents, 85 OC homeless) (analyzed 2016-2017). Rates of opioid overdose, benzodiazepine co-ingestion prevalence, and associations with socioeconomic status (SES; education, poverty, median income) using ZIP code analysis in the residential and homeless communities were calculated. Results: Of 1205 deaths, 904 involved prescription-type opioids, 223 involved heroin, 39 involved both, and 39 not stated; 973 were classified unintentional overdoses, 180 suicides, and 52 undetermined; 49% of cases involved benzodiazepines. Prescription-type opioid and heroin death rates for residents were 5.4/ 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0-5.8) and 1.2/100,000 person-years (95% CI: 1.0-1.4), respectively.

The optimal test for LTBI screening is uncertain.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the homeless and drug-rehabilitation clinic clients chronically using crack in Western Brazil. Participants were interviewed and offered HIV testing plus tuberculin skin testing (TST) and QuantiFeron®-Gold-in-Tube (QFT). We considered LTBI when either TST or QFT were positive. Factors associated with LTBI were adjusted in a multivariate model.RESULTS: Among 372 subjects with at least one valid test, 216 (58%) had LTBI. TST was not read in 18.4%; QFT was indeterminate in 2.5%. TST detected 27 (26%) extra LTBI cases among 75 QFT-negative individuals. PWUD had over three-fold odds for LTBI. TST was 4.5 times more likely to be positive in BCG-vaccinated individuals.CONCLUSION: Given the high risk of progression to disease in this population, the high rates of loss to TST reading and the possibility of false-positive TST results from BCG vaccination, we endorse current CDC recommendations to use QFT for LTBI screening among the homeless and PWUD. However, because adding TST to a negative QFT increased LTBI detection considerably, TST should be considered in QFT-negative individuals.",2018,,Int J Drug Policy,59,,24-27,,10.1016/j.drugpo.2018.06.012,,#3937,doValleLeonedeOliveira 2018,,
Unmet need for medication for opioid use disorder among persons who inject drugs in 23 U.S. cities,"Handanagic, Senad; Broz, Dita; Finlayson, Teresa; Kanny, Dafna; Wejnert, Cyprian; NHBS Study Group","BACKGROUND: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and premature mortality due to drug overdose. Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone or buprenorphine, reduces injecting behaviors, HIV and HCV transmission, and mortality from opioid overdose. Using data from National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, we evaluated the unmet need for MOUD among PWID in 23 U.S. cities.METHODS: PWID were recruited by respondent-driven sampling, interviewed, and tested for HIV. This analysis includes PWID who were ≥18 years old and reported injecting drugs and opioid use in the past 12 months. We used Poisson regression to examine factors associated with self-reported unmet need for MOUD and reported adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: Of 10,879 PWID reporting using opioids, 68.8% were male, 48.2% were ≥45 years of age, 38.8% were non-Hispanic White, 49.6% experienced homelessness, and 28.0% reported an unmet need for MOUD in the past 12 months. PWID who were more likely to report unmet need for MOUD experienced homelessness (aPR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.19-1.34), were incarcerated in the past 12 months (aPR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.08-1.23), injected ≥once a day (aPR 1.42; 95% CI: 1.31-1.55), reported overdose (aPR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.24-1.42), and sharing of syringes (aPR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.06-1.23).CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of MOUD provision for PWID is critical.

Treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection with 12 once weekly directly-observed doses of isoniazid and rifapentine among persons experiencing homelessness,"Nwana, Nwabunie; Marks, Suzanne M.; Lan, Edward; Chang, Alicia H.; Holcombe, Michael; Morris, Sapna Bamrah","OBJECTIVES: To investigate treatment outcomes and associated characteristics of persons experiencing homelessness who received 12-weekly doses of directly observed isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP/DOT) treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI).METHODS: Among homeless persons treated with 3HP/DOT during July 2011 -June 2015 in 11 U.S. TB programs, we conducted descriptive analyses of observational data, and identified associations between sociodemographic factors and treatment outcomes. Qualitative interviews were conducted to understand programmatic experiences.RESULTS: Of 393 persons experiencing homelessness (median age: 50 years; range: 13-74 years), 301 (76.6%) completed treatment, 55 (14.0%) were lost to follow-up, 18 (4.6%) stopped because of an adverse event (AE), and 19 (4.8%) stopped after relocations or refusing treatment. Eighty-one (20.6%) had at least one AE. Persons aged ≥65 were more likely to discontinue treatment than persons aged 31-44 years. Programs reported difficulty in following up with persons experiencing homelessness because of relocations, mistrust, and alcohol or drug use.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of administering the 3HP/DOT LTBI regimen to persons experiencing homelessness, a high-risk population.",2019,,PLoS One,14,3,e0213524,,10.1371/journal.pone.0213524,,#3940,Nwana 2019,,
Mass screening for active case finding of pulmonary tuberculosis in the Russian Federation: how to save costs,"Bogdanova, E.; Mariandyshev, O.; Hinderaker, S. G.; Nikishova, E.; Kulizhskaya, A.; Sveshnikova, O.; Grjibovski, A.; Heldal, E.; Mariandyshev, A.","BACKGROUND: In Russia, mass chest X-ray (CXR) screening for tuberculosis (TB) is mandatory.OBJECTIVE: To compare the yield and the cost per TB case detected and the total cost of CXR screening, passive case finding and contact tracing among adolescents and adults in the Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russian Federation, 2013-2017.DESIGN: This was an analysis of costing strategies using aggregated data. Costing information was obtained from the Finance Department of the Arkhangelsk Clinical TB Dispensary, Arkhangelsk, and the Territorial Fund of Mandatory Medical Insurance, Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation.RESULTS: TB cases were detected using CXR screening (n = 684, 46%), contact tracing (n = 61, 4%) and passive case finding (n = 743, 46%). The number of cases detected using CXR screening, contact tracing and passive case finding was respectively 28,753 and 960/100 000. The mean costs/test were respectively US$3.54 (US$12 541/case), US$20.28 (US$2693/case) and US$11.85 (US$1235/case) using CXR screening, contact tracing and passive case finding The number of cases/100 000 in targeted groups was as follows: HIV-positive persons, 645; homeless persons, 461; and migrants, 441. The cost/TB case detected was respectively US$549, US$768 and US$803.CONCLUSION: Mass CXR screening (excluding HIV-positive, migrant and homeless populations) has low yield and high cost per TB case detected. It should be stopped and resources should instead be used to strengthen the screening of targeted high-risk groups, contacts and passive case finding.",2019,,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,23,7,830-837,,10.5588/ijtld.18.0449,,#3941,Bogdanova 2019,,
Prescription opioid injection among young people who inject drugs in New York City: a mixed-methods description and associations with hepatitis C virus infection and overdose,"Mateu-Gelabert, Pedro; Guarino, Honoria; Zibbell, Jon E.; Teubl, Jennifer; Fong, Chunki; Goodbody, Elizabeth; Edlin, Brian; Salvati, Carli; Friedman, Samuel R.","AIM: Evidence is emerging that prescription opioid (PO) injection is associated with increased health risks. This mixed-methods study compares the mechanics of PO and heroin injection and examines the demographic and drug-related correlates of lifetime PO injection in a sample of young people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City (NYC).METHODS: Qualitative analysis of 46 semi-structured interviews with young adult opioid users ages 18-32. Interview segments describing PO injection were analyzed for common themes. Quantitative analysis of structured interviews with 539 young adult opioid users ages 18-29 recruited via respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Analyses are based on the subsample of 353 participants (65%) who reported having ever injected drugs. All variables were assessed via self-report, except hepatitis C virus status, which was established via rapid antibody testing.RESULTS: Participants described injecting POs and reported that preparing abuse-deterrent pills for injection is especially cumbersome, requiring extended manipulation and large amounts of water. Injecting POs, in contrast to injecting heroin, requires repeated injections per injection episode. Among RDS-recruited participants, the majority of injectors reported injecting POs, sporadically (33%) or regularly (26%), but often infrequently (≤ 7 days/month). In separate multivariable analyses controlling for syringe- and cooker-sharing, ever injecting POs was a significant predictor of testing HCV antibody-positive (AOR = 2.97) and lifetime experience of non-fatal overdose (AOR = 2.51). Ever injecting POs was independently associated with lifetime homelessness (AOR = 2.93) and having grown up in a middle-income ($51,000-100,000/year vs. ≤ $50,000/year; AOR = 1.86) or a high-income household (> $100,000/year vs. ≤ $50,000/year; AOR = 2.54).CONCLUSIONS: Even in an urban environment like NYC with widespread heroin access, most young PWID have injected POs, although less frequently than heroin. PO injection involves practices that are known to increase risk for blood-borne viral infection (e.g., repeated injections) and predicted testing HCV-positive, as well as overdose. PO injection may also serve as a marker for a subgroup of PWID at elevated risk for multiple drug use-related comorbidities. Programs that provide prevention services to PWID need to tailor harm reduction measures and messaging to the specific practices and harms associated with the injection of POs.",2020,,Harm Reduct J,17,1,22,,10.1186/s12954-020-00367-2,,#3942,Mateu-Gelabert 2020,,
"Trends in, and factors associated with, HIV infection amongst tuberculosis patients in the era of anti-retroviral therapy: a retrospective study in England, Wales and Northern Ireland","Winter, Joanne R.; Stagg, Helen R.; Smith, Colette J.; Lalor, Maeve K.; Davidson, Jennifer A.; Brown, Alison E.; Brown, James; Zenner, Dominik; Lipman, Marc; Pozniak, Anton; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Delpech, Valerie","BACKGROUND: HIV increases the progression of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection to active disease and contributed to increased TB in the UK until 2004. We describe temporal trends in HIV infection amongst patients with TB and identify factors associated with HIV infection.METHODS: We used national surveillance data of all TB cases reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2000 to 2014 and determined HIV status through record linkage to national HIV surveillance. We used logistic regression to identify associations between HIV and demographic, clinical and social factors.RESULTS: There were 106,829 cases of TB in adults (≥ 15 years) reported from 2000 to 2014. The number and proportion of TB patients infected with HIV decreased from 543/6782 (8.0%) in 2004 to 205/6461 (3.2%) in 2014. The proportion of patients diagnosed with HIV > 91 days prior to their TB diagnosis increased from 33.5% in 2000 to 60.2% in 2013. HIV infection was highest in people of black African ethnicity from countries with high HIV prevalence (32.3%), patients who misused drugs (8.1%) and patients with miliary or meningeal TB (17.2%).CONCLUSIONS: There has been an overall decrease in TB-HIV co-infection and a decline in the proportion of patients diagnosed simultaneously with both infections. However, high rates of HIV remain in some sub-populations of patients with TB, particularly black Africans born in countries with high HIV prevalence and people with a history of drug misuse. Whilst the current policy of testing all patients diagnosed with TB for HIV infection is important in ensuring appropriate management of TB patients, many of these TB cases would be preventable if HIV could be diagnosed before TB develops. Improving screening for both latent TB and HIV and ensuring early treatment of HIV in these populations could help prevent these TB cases. British HIV Association guidelines on latent TB testing for people with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa remain relevant, and latent TB screening for people with HIV with a history of drug misuse, homelessness or imprisonment should also be considered.",2018,,BMC Med,16,1,85,,10.1186/s12916-018-1070-2,,#3943,Winter 2018,,
Multiple strategies to identify HIV-positive black men who have sex with men and transgender women in New York City: a cross-sectional analysis of recruitment results,"Franks, Julie; Mannheimer, Sharon B.; Hirsch-Moverman, Yael; Hayes-Larson, Eleanor; Colson, Paul W.; Ortega, Hugo; El-Sadr, Wafaa M.","INTRODUCTION: Black men who have sex with men and transgender women are at high risk for HIV infection, but are more likely to be unaware of their infection or not in care for diagnosed HIV compared to other races. Respondent driven sampling has been advanced as a method to reach stigmatized and hidden populations for HIV testing. We compared strategies to recruit black, substance-using men who have sex with men and transgender women to identify newly diagnosed HIV infection, or those previously diagnosed but not in care.METHODS: The STAR (Seek, Test, and Retain) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01790360) used several recruitment strategies to identify black, substance-using men who have sex with men and transgender women with undiagnosed HIV infection or with previously diagnosed HIV infection but who were not in HIV care. Respondent-driven sampling, community-based recruitment and online advertising were used to recruit participants. Incentivized peer referral was integrated into all recruitment strategies. Participants completed interviewer-administered questionnaires and HIV testing. Demographic and HIV risk-related characteristics and recruitment strategy were summarized and stratified by HIV status. Associations were tested using Pearson's chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Factors associated with HIV-positive diagnosis at p < 0.1 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model.RESULTS: From July 2012 through October 2015, the study enrolled 1929 participants; 96.3% men who have sex with men and 3.7% transgender women. Behavioural risk factors included recent condomless anal sex (55.6%) and recent substance use during sex (73.1%). HIV prevalence was 8.7%. In multivariable analysis, significant associations with HIV infection included being transgender; non-Hispanic black; gay/homosexual orientation; not homeless; and less likely to have insufficient income for necessities. Among recruitment strategies, respondent driven sampling was least effective in identifying HIV-positive participants.CONCLUSIONS: Integrating multiple recruitment strategies yielded a large sample of black men who have sex with men and transgender women at substantial risk for HIV. Respondent-driven sampling was less effective than other strategies at identifying men who have sex with men and transgender women with HIV.",2018,,J Int AIDS Soc,21,3,e25091,,10.1002/jia2.25091,,#3944,Franks 2018,,
"Long-term survival and cause-specific mortality of patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis in São Paulo state, Brazil, 2010-15: a population-based, longitudinal study","Ranzani, Otavio T.; Rodrigues, Laura C.; Bombarda, Sidney; Minto, Cátia M.; Waldman, Eliseu A.; Carvalho, Carlos R. R.","BACKGROUND: Long-term survival and cause-specific mortality of patients who start tuberculosis treatment is rarely described. We aimed to assess the long-term survival of these patients and evaluate the association between vulnerable conditions (social, health behaviours, and comorbidities) and cause-specific mortality in a country with a high burden of tuberculosis.METHODS: In this population-based, longitudinal study in São Paulo state, Brazil, we described the 5-year survival of patients who were newly diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2010. We included patients with newly-diagnosed tuberculosis, aged 15 years or older, and notified to the São Paulo State Tuberculosis Program in 2010. We excluded patients whose diagnosis had changed during follow-up (ie, they did not have tuberculosis) and patients who had multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. We selected our population with tuberculosis from the dedicated electronic system TBweb. Our primary objective was to estimate the excess mortality over 5 years and within the group who survived the first year, compared with the general São Paulo state population. We also estimated the association between social vulnerability (imprisonment and homelessness), health behaviours (alcohol and drug use), and comorbidities (diabetes and mental disorders) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We used the competing risk analysis framework, estimating cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for potential confounding factors.FINDINGS: In 2010, there were 19 252 notifications of tuberculosis cases. We excluded 550 cases as patients were younger than 15 years, 556 cases that were not tuberculosis, 2597 retreatments, and 48 cases of MDR tuberculosis, resulting in a final cohort of 15 501 patients with tuberculosis. Over a period of 5 years from tuberculosis diagnosis, 2660 (17%) of 15 501 patients died. Compared with the source population, matched by age, sex, and calendar year, the standardised mortality ratio was 6·47 (95% CI 6·22-6·73) over 5 years and 3·93 (3·71-4·17) among those who survived the first year. 1197 (45%) of 2660 deaths were due to infection. Homelessness and alcohol and drug use were associated with death from infection (adjusted cause-specific HR 1·60, 95% CI 1·39-1·85), cardiovascular (1·43, 1·06-1·95), and external or ill-defined causes of death (1·80, 1·37-2·36). Diabetes was associated with deaths from cardiovascular causes (1·70, 1·23-2·35).INTERPRETATION: Patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis were at a higher risk of death than were the source population, even after tuberculosis treatment. Post-tuberculosis sequelae and vulnerability are associated with excess mortality and must be addressed to mitigate the tuberculosis burden worldwide.FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.",2020,,Lancet Infect Dis,20,1,123-132,,10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30518-3,,#3945,Ranzani 2020,,

Subjects were stratified according to their macro-areas of origin (Europe, Asia, Africa, South-America), housing (with or without house), and immigration status (presence or absence of residence permit). BP levels were measured in three consecutive visits according to recommendations from current European Guidelines.RESULTS: From an overall population sample of 9827 adult individuals, we initially identified 994 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension (10.1%), among whom 536 (5.4%) had valid BP data. Among these, 50.6% came from Europe, 21.6% from Africa, 24.1% from Asia, and 3.7% from South-America. They were predominantly male (54.7%), middle aged (42.8 ± 12.1 years at arrival and 51.6 ± 10.6 years at first visit) and untreated (72.8%) individuals with baseline systolic/diastolic BP levels of 156.9 ± 22.2/97.3 ± 12.4 mmHg). BP levels remained higher in homeless than in housed people at both visit 2 (150.0 ± 21.8/92.6 ± 12.9 mmHg vs. 142.9 ± 19.3/89.9 ± 11.6 mmHg; P < 0.001) and visit 3 (147.9 ± 22.2/91.7 ± 12.5 mmHg vs. 141.8 ± 19.4/89.2 ± 12.0 mmHg; P = 0.013). We also observed reductions of both systolic and diastolic BP levels compared to baseline values in immigrants stratified according to residence permit, although without relevant differences among groups.CONCLUSIONS: Beyond conventional risk factors, socio-economic issues, including lack of residence permit or habitation, may affect BP levels and control in frail populations of immigrants, which have been marginally considered before.",2019,,High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,26,6,467-473,,10.1007/s40292-019-00349-x,,#3946,Tocci 2019,,
Developing a triage tool for use in identifying people living with HIV who are at risk for non-retention in HIV care,"Gebrezgi, Merhawi T.; Fennie, Kristopher P.; Sheehan, Diana M.; Ibrahimou, Boubakari; Jones, Sandra G.; Brock, Petra; Ladner, Robert A.; Trepka, Mary Jo","INTRODUCTION:: Identifying PLHIV in HIV care who are at particular risk of non-retention in care is an important element in improving their HIV care outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop a risk prediction tool to identify PLHIV at risk of non-retention in care over the course of the next year.METHOD:: We used stepwise logistic regression to assess sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral predictors of non-retention in HIV care. Retention in care was defined as having evidence of at least two encounters with an HIV care provider (or CD4 or viral load lab tests as a proxy measure for the encounter), at least 3 months apart within a year. We validated the risk prediction tool internally using the bootstrap method.RESULTS:: The risk prediction tool included a total of six factors: age group, race, poverty level, homelessness, problematic alcohol/drug use and viral suppression status. The total risk score ranged from 0 to 17. Compared to those in the lowest quartile (0 risk score), those who were in the middle two quartiles (score 1–4) and those in the upper quartile (>4 risk score) were more likely not to be retained in care (odds ratio [OR] 1.63 [CI; 1.39–1.92] and OR 4.82 [CI; 4.04–5.78] respectively). The discrimination ability for the prediction model was 0.651.CONCLUSION:: We found that increased risk for non-retention in care can be predicted with routinely available variables.

"Fentanyl-contaminated drugs and non-fatal overdose among people who inject drugs in Baltimore, MD","Park, Ju Nyeong; Weir, Brian W.; Allen, Sean T.; Chaulk, Patrick; Sherman, Susan G.","BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis remains a major public health issue in the US and beyond. Despite rapid rises in fentanyl-related mortality nationally, little is known about the role of fentanyl in the occurrence of non-fatal overdose among people who use drugs. We examined the prevalence of non-fatal overdose and perceived fentanyl exposure among syringe services program (SSP) clients and modeled the correlates of non-fatal overdose.METHODS: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 203 SSP clients in Baltimore, MD recruited in 2016. Logistic regression models were used to identify the correlates of experiencing non-fatal overdose in the past 12 months.RESULTS: The majority (65%) was male, 52% were black, 41% were white, and 37% were homeless. Almost all (97%) used heroin, 64% injected heroin with cocaine (i.e., speedball), and many used other types of drugs. Half (53%) perceived fentanyl presence in their drugs either half, most or all of the time. Lifetime and past 12 month prevalence of non-fatal overdose were 58 and 31%, respectively. Independent correlates of non-fatal overdose in the past 12 months were perceiving fentanyl in drugs more than half the time (aOR = 2.79; 95% CI = 1.00-4.68), speedball injection (aOR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.26-6.23), non-prescription buprenorphine use (aOR = 6.37; 95% CI = 2.86-14.17), and homelessness (aOR = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.28-7.39).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that SSP clients are at high-risk of overdose, some of which is likely attributable to fentanyl exposure. Addressing the rising fentanyl epidemic will require comprehensive and innovative strategies that attend to drug use patterns and structural factors such as homelessness.",2018,,Harm Reduct J,15,1,34,,10.1186/s12954-018-0240-z,,#3948,Park 2018,,

Video-observed therapy (VOT) has been conditionally recommended by WHO as an alternative to DOT. We tested whether levels of treatment observation were improved with VOT.METHODS: We did a multicentre, analyst-blinded, randomised controlled superiority trial in 22 clinics in England (UK). Eligible participants were patients aged at least 16 years with active pulmonary or non-pulmonary tuberculosis who were eligible for DOT according to local guidance. Exclusion criteria included patients who did not have access to charging a smartphone. We randomly assigned participants to either VOT (daily remote observation using a smartphone app) or DOT (observations done three to five times per week in the home, community, or clinic settings). Randomisation was done by the SealedEnvelope service using minimisation. DOT involved treatment observation by a health-care or lay worker, with any remaining daily doses self-administered. VOT was provided by a centralised service in London. Patients were trained to record and send videos of every dose ingested 7 days per week using a smartphone app. Trained treatment observers viewed these videos through a password-protected website. Patients were also encouraged to report adverse drug events on the videos. Smartphones and data plans were provided free of charge by study investigators. DOT or VOT observation records were completed by observers until treatment or study end. The primary outcome was completion of 80% or more scheduled treatment observations over the first 2 months following enrolment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and restricted (including only patients completing at least 1 week of observation on allocated arm) analyses were done. Superiority was determined by a 15% difference in the proportion of patients with the primary outcome (60% vs 75%). This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN26184967.FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2014, and Oct 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 226 patients; 112 to VOT and 114 to DOT. Overall, 131 (58%) patients had a history of homelessness, imprisonment, drug use, alcohol problems or mental health problems. In the ITT analysis, 78 (70%) of 112 patients on VOT achieved ≥80% scheduled observations successfully completed during the first 2 months compared with 35 (31%) of 114 on DOT (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5·48, 95% CI 3·10-9·68; p<0·0001). In the restricted analysis, 78 (77%) of 101 patients on VOT achieved the primary outcome compared with 35 (63%) of 56 on DOT (adjusted OR 2·52; 95% CI 1·17-5·54; p=0·017). Stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported (in 16 [14%] of 112 on VOT and nine [8%] of 114 on DOT).INTERPRETATION: VOT was a more effective approach to observation of tuberculosis treatment than DOT.

Robert; Khan, Awal; Marks, Suzanne M.; Myles, Ranell L.; Salomon, Joshua A.; Self, Julie L.; Winston, Carla A.; Menzies, Nicolas A.","BACKGROUND: Despite an overall decline in tuberculosis incidence and mortality in the USA in the past two decades, racial and ethnic disparities in tuberculosis outcomes persist. We aimed to examine the extent to which inequalities in health and neighbourhood-level social vulnerability mediate these disparities.METHODS: We extracted data from the US National Tuberculosis Surveillance System on individuals with tuberculosis during 2011-19. Individuals with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or missing data on race and ethnicity were excluded. We examined potential disparities in tuberculosis outcomes among US-born and non-US-born individuals and conducted a mediation analysis for groups with a higher risk of treatment incompletion (a summary outcome comprising diagnosis after death, treatment discontinuation, or death during treatment). We used sequential multiple mediation to evaluate eight potential mediators: three comorbid conditions (HIV, end-stage renal disease, and diabetes), homelessness, and four census tract-level measures (poverty, unemployment, insurance coverage, and racialised economic segregation [measured by Index of Concentration at the ExtremesRace-Income]). We estimated the marginal contribution of each mediator using Shapley values.FINDINGS: During 2011-19, 27 788 US-born individuals and 57 225 non-US-born individuals were diagnosed with active tuberculosis, of whom 27 605 and 56 253 individuals, respectively, met eligibility criteria for our analyses. We did not observe evidence of disparities in tuberculosis outcomes for non-US-born individuals by race and ethnicity. Therefore, subsequent analyses were restricted to US-born individuals. Relative to White individuals, Black and Hispanic individuals had a higher risk of not completing tuberculosis treatment (adjusted relative risk 1·27, 95% CI 1·19-1·35; 1·22, 1·11-1·33, respectively). In multiple mediator analysis, the eight measured mediators explained 67% of the disparity for Black individuals and 65% for Hispanic individuals. The biggest contributors to these disparities for Black individuals and Hispanic individuals were concomitant end-stage renal disease, concomitant HIV, census tract-level racialised economic segregation, and census tract-level poverty.INTERPRETATION: Our findings underscore the need for initiatives to reduce disparities in tuberculosis outcomes among US-born individuals, particularly in highly racially and economically polarised neighbourhoods. Mitigating the structural and environmental factors that lead to disparities in the prevalence of comorbidities and their case management should be a priority.FUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention Epidemiologic and Economic Modeling Agreement.",2024,,Lancet Public Health,9,8,e564-e572,,10.1016/S2468-2667(24)00151-8,,#3950,Regan 2024,,
Synthetic cannabinoid use among a sample of individuals enrolled in community-based recovery programs: Are synthetic cannabinoids actually preferred to other drugs?,"Smith, Kirsten Elin; Staton, Michele","Background: Over the past decade, availability and use of novel psychoactive substances such as synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRA) have proliferated globally. However, the prevalence of SCRAs use remains uncertain, as does the degree to which individuals reporting SCRA use prefer SCRA to other drugs. Methods: In April 2017, a total of 500 anonymous surveys were completed by clients enrolled in a residential drug recovery program. Chi-square and t tests were used to examine significant differences between those who had ever used SCRA and those who had not. Logistic regression analysis was conducted in order to determine which other substances used within the past 12 months were significantly associated with past-12-month SCRA use. Results: About 69% (68.4%) of clients reported lifetime SCRA use. Those reporting SCRA use were predominantly younger ( x¯  = 32.5 vs. 40.7, P < .001), single (60.3% vs. 48.1%, P = .011), and white (87.1% vs. 77.7%, P = .008) and were more likely to have experienced past-12-month homelessness (6.5% vs. 3.2%, P = .004). This group had higher rates of probation/parole involvement (79.2% vs. 61.8%, P < .001) and incarceration (91.8% vs. 79.6%, P < .001). Individuals reporting SCRA use also showed extensive substance use histories and favored heroin, opioids, and amphetamines compared with SCRA. Only 5.2% of the SCRA-using group stated that SCRA was a preferred substance, and only 11.8% reported that they would try SCRA again. E-cigarettes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.88), traditional cannabis (AOR = 3.87), amphetamines (AOR = 2.20), and synthetic cathinones (AOR = 3.51) were significantly associated with past-12-month SCRA use. Motivations for use included circumnavigating drug screens and peer influence. Approximately half of those who tried SCRA reported adverse effects associated with use.

"Overdose Risk and Client Characteristics Associated With the Injection of Buprenorphine at a Medically Supervised Injecting Center in Sydney, Australia","Power, Joseph; Salmon, Allison M.; Latimer, Julie; Jauncey, Marianne; Day, Carolyn A.","Background: Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) were developed to improve the safety profile of opioid substitution treatment (OST) and reduce diversion and injection, yet continue to be injected, despite the risk of harm. Previous studies examining injection of these substances have relied on self-reported injection and overdose. Using data from the Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Center (MSIC) in Sydney, this study aimed to assess the overdose risk associated with the use of buprenorphine and BNX and identify factors associated with injecting. Methods: Client data routinely collected from MSIC, a drug consumption room where clients can legally inject drugs under supervision, was used. Odds ratios (OR) to assess the risk of overdose and their associated 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated and compared to other substances. Univariate analysis using χ-square and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine characteristics associated with buprenorphine and BNX injection. Results: Data from 1,020,782 injections by 15,832 individuals were analyzed. Risk of overdose was low for buprenorphine compared to other substances (OR 0.16; 95%CI: 0.07-0.19) and no overdoses occurred when BNX was injected. Injection of both buprenorphine and BNX was associated with male gender, homelessness, no income/reliance upon government payments, and prior imprisonment. Conclusions: Buprenorphine and BNX continue to be injected, albeit in small numbers. This is the first study to report on injection and overdose risk using direct observation, and has confirmed the lower overdose risk. MSIC clients who inject buprenorphine and BNX tend to be marginalized and may benefit from targeted harm reduction measures.",2019,,Subst Use Misuse,54,10,1646-1653,,10.1080/10826084.2019.1600147,,#3952,Power 2019,,
A cross-sectional study of factors associated with COVID-19 testing among people who inject drugs: missed opportunities for reaching those most at risk,"Yeager, Samantha; Abramovitz, Daniela; Harvey-Vera, Alicia Yolanda; Vera, Carlos F.; Algarin, Angel Blake; Smith, Laramie Rae; Rangel, Gudelia; Artamonova, Irina; Patterson, Thomas Leroy; Bazzi, Angela Robertson; Brugman, Emma L.; Strathdee, Steffanie Ann","BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined correlates of COVID-19 testing among PWID in the U.S.-Mexico border region and described encounters with services representing potential opportunities (i.e., 'touchpoints') where COVID-19 testing could have been offered.METHODS: Between October, 2020 and September, 2021, participants aged ≥18 years from San Diego, California, USA and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico who injected drugs within the last month completed surveys and SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and HCV serologic testing. Logistic regression identified factors associated with COVID-19 testing including potential touchpoints, comorbidities and COVID-19 related misinformation and disinformation.RESULTS: Of 583 PWID, 30.5% previously had a COVID-19 test. Of 172 PWID who tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive (30.1%), 50.3% encountered at least one touchpoint where COVID-19 testing could have been offered within the prior six months. Factors independently associated with at least two fold higher odds of COVID-19 testing were living in San Diego, recent incarceration, receiving substance use treatment, and experiencing ≥1 chronic health condition. Homelessness, having received ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and having a HIV or HCV test since the COVID-19 epidemic began were also independently associated with having had a prior COVID-19 test.CONCLUSION: We identified several factors independently associated with COVID-19 testing and multiple touchpoints where COVID-19 testing could be scaled up for PWID, such as SUD treatment programs and syringe service programs.

"COVID-19 pandemic and other factors associated with unfavorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes-Almaty, Kazakhstan, 2018-2021","Gabdullina, Malika; Maes, Edmond F.; Horth, Roberta Z.; Dzhazybekova, Panagul; Amanova, Gulzhan N.; Zikriyarova, Sanam; Nabirova, Dilyara A.","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively influenced the availability of tuberculosis (TB) services, such as detection, diagnosis and treatment, around the world, including Kazakhstan. We set out to estimate the COVID-19 pandemic influence on TB treatment outcomes by comparing outcomes among people starting treatment before the pandemic (2018-2019) and during the pandemic (2020-2021) and to determine risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among all people newly diagnosed with drug-sensitive pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB at least 18 years old who initiated treatment from 2018 to 2021 in Almaty. We abstracted data from the national electronic TB register. Unfavorable treatment outcomes were ineffective treatment, death, loss to follow-up, results not evaluated, and transferred. We used multivariable Poisson regression to calculate adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).RESULTS: Among 1548 people newly diagnosed with TB during the study period, average age was 43 years (range 18-93) and 52% were male. The number of people initiating treatment was higher before than the pandemic (935 vs. 613, respectively). There was significantly different proportions before compared to during the pandemic for people diagnosed through routine screening (39% vs. 31%, p < 0.001), 60 years and older (16% vs. 22%, p = 0.005), and with diabetes (5% vs. 8%, p = 0.017). There was no difference in the proportion of HIV (8% in both periods). Unfavorable outcomes increased from 11 to 20% during the pandemic (aRR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.44-2.31). Case fatality rose from 6 to 9% (p = 0.038). Risk factors for unfavorable TB treatment outcomes among all participants were being male (aRR = 1.44, 95%CI = 1.12-1.85), having HIV (aRR = 2.72, 95%CI = 1.99-3.72), having alcohol use disorder (aRR = 2.58, 95%CI = 1.83-3.62) and experiencing homelessness (aRR = 2.94, 95%CI = 1.80-4.80). Protective factors were being 18-39 years old (aRR = 0.33, 95%CI = 0.24-0.44) and 40-59 years old (aRR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.41-0.75) compared to 60 years old and up.CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic was associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes for people newly diagnosed with drug-sensitive TB in Almaty, Kazakhstan. People with fewer comorbidities were at increased risk. Results point to the need to maintain continuity of care for persons on TB treatment, especially those at higher risk for poor outcomes during periods of healthcare service disruption.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1247661,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1247661,,#3954,Gabdullina 2023,,

Providing effective treatment is a key strategy for reducing TB deaths. In this study, we identified factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes among individuals treated for TB in Brazil.METHODS: We obtained data on individuals treated for TB between 2015 and 2018 from Brazil's National Disease Notification System (SINAN). We excluded patients with a history of prior TB disease or with diagnosed TB drug resistance. We extracted information on patient-level factors potentially associated with unsuccessful treatment, including demographic and social factors, comorbid health conditions, health-related behaviors, health system level at which care was provided, use of directly observed therapy (DOT), and clinical examination results. We categorized treatment outcomes as successful (cure, completed) or unsuccessful (death, regimen failure, loss to follow-up). We fit multivariate logistic regression models to identify factors associated with unsuccessful treatment.RESULTS: Among 259,484 individuals treated for drug susceptible TB, 19.7% experienced an unsuccessful treatment outcome (death during treatment 7.8%, regimen failure 0.1%, loss to follow-up 11.9%). The odds of unsuccessful treatment were higher with older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.90 [95% confidence interval: 2.62-3.21] for 85-100-year-olds vs. 25-34-year-olds), male sex (aOR 1.28 [1.25-1.32], vs. female sex), Black race (aOR 1.23 [1.19-1.28], vs. White race), no education (aOR 2.03 [1.91-2.17], vs. complete high school education), HIV infection (aOR 2.72 [2.63-2.81], vs. no HIV infection), illicit drug use (aOR 1.95 [1.88-2.01], vs. no illicit drug use), alcohol consumption (aOR 1.46 [1.41-1.50], vs. no alcohol consumption), smoking (aOR 1.20 [1.16-1.23], vs. non-smoking), homelessness (aOR 3.12 [2.95-3.31], vs. no homelessness), and immigrant status (aOR 1.27 [1.11-1.45], vs. non-immigrants). Treatment was more likely to be unsuccessful for individuals treated in tertiary care (aOR 2.20 [2.14-2.27], vs. primary care), and for patients not receiving DOT (aOR 2.35 [2.29-2.41], vs. receiving DOT).CONCLUSION: The risk of unsuccessful TB treatment varied systematically according to individual and service-related factors. Concentrating clinical attention on individuals with a high risk of poor treatment outcomes could improve the overall effectiveness of TB treatment in Brazil.",2024,,BMC Infect Dis,24,1,531,,10.1186/s12879-024-09417-7,,#3955,Ryuk 2024,,
Significant decrease in injection risk behaviours among participants in a needle exchange programme,"Kåberg, Martin; Karlsson, Niklas; Discacciati, Andrea; Widgren, Katarina; Weiland, Ola; Ekström, Anna Mia; Hammarberg, Anders","Background and aims: Sharing of unsterile injection equipment contributes to transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) among people who inject drugs (PWID) but is largely preventable through needle exchange programmes (NEP). Sweden has been one of the last countries in Europe to scale up access to NEP for PWID, who consequently have high prevalence rates of HCV and HIV. The aim of the study was to investigate demographic and drug-related determinants of injection risk behaviours, sharing of needle/syringe and paraphernalia, and patterns of change over time in subgroups of PWID participating in the Stockholm NEP.Methods: The Stockholm NEP started in 2013 as the first formal NEP in the region. A total of 2860 PWID were included in this prospective open cohort study. The association between demographic and drug-related determinants and injection risk behaviours were analysed at baseline and followed up at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months post-enrolment.Results: The following factors were associated with high levels of injection risk behaviours at inclusion: female gender, homelessness, low education level, younger age, amphetamine use, not in opioid substitution therapy (OST), being HIV negative and being HCV positive. We found an overall significant decrease in injection risk behaviours over time among participants. Not previously investigated in depth, we found that subgroups of participants varied in degrees of injection risk behaviour reduction over time and that women decreased injection risk behaviours faster than men. Enrolment in OST, HIV positive and age <25 years at inclusion were not associated with a decrease in injection risk behaviours over time.Conclusions: In this prospective cohort study over 4 years, we found that NEP participation was associated with a significant decrease in injection risk behaviours.",2020,,Infect Dis (Lond),52,5,336-346,,10.1080/23744235.2020.1727002,,#3956,Kåberg 2020,,

Moreover, they are particularly susceptible to adverse infection outcomes with limited access to the health care system. Data on the seroprevalence of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella within this cohort are missing.METHODS: The seroprevalence of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella was determined within the homeless population in Germany. Predictors of lacking immune protection were determined using multivariable logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Homeless individuals in Germany (n = 611) showed a seroprevalence of 88.5% (95% CI: 85.8-91.0) for measles, 83.8% (95% CI: 80.6-86.6) for mumps, 86.1% (95% CI: 83.1-88.7) for rubella, and 95.7% (95% CI 93.8-97.2) for varicella. Measles seroprevalences declined from individuals born in 1965 to individuals born in 1993, with seroprevalences not compatible with a 95% threshold in individuals born after 1980. For mumps, seroprevalences declined from individuals born in 1950 to individuals born in 1984. Here, seroprevalences were not compatible with a 92% threshold for individuals born after 1975. Seronegativity for measles, mumps and rubella was associated with age but not with gender or country of origin.DISCUSSION: Herd immunity for measles and mumps is not achieved in this homeless cohort, while there was sufficient immune protection for rubella and varicella. Declining immune protection rates in younger individuals warrant immunization campaigns also targeting marginalized groups such as homeless individuals. Given that herd immunity thresholds are not reached for individuals born after 1980 for measles, and after 1975 for mumps, vaccination campaigns should prioritize individuals within these age groups.",2024,,Front Public Health,12,,1375151,,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1375151,,#3957,Graf 2024,,
"Isoniazid Monoresistance and Rate of Culture Conversion among Patients in the State of Georgia with Confirmed Tuberculosis, 2009-2014","Salindri, Argita D.; Sales, Rose-Marie F.; DiMiceli, Lauren; Schechter, Marcos C.; Kempker, Russell R.; Magee, Matthew J.","RATIONALE: Isoniazid-monoresistant tuberculosis (INH-monoresistant TB) is the most common drug-resistant TB type in the United States; however, its impact on TB treatment outcomes is not clear.OBJECTIVES: This study aims to understand 1) factors associated with INH-monoresistant TB and 2) the association between INH monoresistance and response to TB treatment.METHODS: We studied all patients with TB (age, ≥15 yr) reported to the Georgia State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SENDSS) from 2009 to 2014. INH-monoresistant TB was defined as a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate resistant to isoniazid only. Time to sputum culture conversion was defined as the time (measured in days) from TB treatment initiation to the date of the first consistently negative culture result reported to the SENDSS. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the odds and hazard rate of sputum culture conversion, all-cause mortality, and poor TB outcome among patients with INH-monoresistant TB.RESULTS: Among 1,141 culture-confirmed patients with available drug susceptibility testing results, 998 (87.5%) were susceptible to TB first-line drugs, and 143 (12.5%) were patients with INH-monoresistant TB. In multivariable analysis, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.67) and homelessness (aOR, 5.55; 95% CI, 3.38-9.17) were associated with higher odds of INH-monoresistant TB. In the same multivariable model, older age (≥65 yr old) (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.55) and miliary disease (aOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.01-0.96) were associated with lower odds of INH-monoresistant TB. Among 1,116 patients with pulmonary TB, the median time to sputum culture conversion was 30 days (interquartile range, 13-58). The rate of culture conversion was similar among patients with and without INH monoresistance (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.95-1.40).

"Patterns of polysubstance use and overdose among people who inject drugs in Baltimore, Maryland: A latent class analysis","Schneider, Kristin E.; Park, Ju Nyeong; Allen, Sean T.; Weir, Brian W.; Sherman, Susan G.","BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdose rates continue to climb. However, little research has examined the reach of overdose education and naloxone trainings among people who inject drugs (PWID). Understanding gaps in coverage is essential to improving the public health response to the ongoing crisis.METHODS: We surveyed 298 PWID in Baltimore City, MD. We conducted a latent class analysis of drug use indicators and tested for differences by class in past month overdose, having received overdose training, and currently having naloxone.RESULTS: Three classes emerged: cocaine/heroin injection (40.2%), heroin only injection (32.2%), and multi-drug/multi-route use (27.6%). The prevalence of past month overdose differed marginally by class (p = 0.06), with the multi-drug/multi-route use class having the highest prevalence (22.5%) and the heroin only class having the lowest (4.6%). The prevalence of previous overdose training differed significantly by class (p = 0.02), with the heroin/cocaine class (76.5%) having more training than the other two classes. Training was least common amongst the multi-drug/multi-route class (60.3%), though not statistically different from the heroin only class (63.0%). Classes did not differ significantly in current naloxone possession, although the multi-drug/multi-route class exhibited the lowest prevalence of naloxone possession (37.2%).CONCLUSIONS: People who inject multiple substances are at high risk for overdose and are also the least likely to receive overdose trainings. The current service landscape does not adequately reach individuals with high levels of structural vulnerability and high levels of drug use and homelessness. Actively including this subgroup into harm reduction efforts are essential for preventing overdose fatalities.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend,201,,71-77,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.026,,#3959,Schneider 2019,,
Homeless Shelter Characteristics and Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2,"Karb, Rebecca; Samuels, Elizabeth; Vanjani, Rahul; Trimbur, Catherine; Napoli, Anthony","INTRODUCTION: The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has predictably followed the familiar contours of well established socioeconomic health inequities, exposing and often amplifying preexisting disparities. People living in homeless shelters are at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify shelter characteristics that may be associated with higher transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. Shelter residents 18 years old and older were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April 19-April 24, 2020. At time of testing, we collected participant characteristics, symptomatology, and vital signs. Shelter characteristics and infection control strategies were collected through a structured phone questionnaire with shelter administrators.RESULTS: A total of 299 shelter residents (99%, 299/302) participated. Thirty-five (11.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Shelter-level prevalence ranged from zero to 35%. Symptom prevalence did not vary by test result. Shelters with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were in more densely populated areas, had more transient resident populations, and instituted fewer physical distancing practices compared to shelters with no cases.CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence varies with shelter characteristics but not individual symptoms. Policies that promote resident stability and physical distancing may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frequent universal testing and congregate housing alternatives that promote stability may help reduce spread of infection.",2020,,West J Emerg Med,21,5,1048-1053,,10.5811/westjem.2020.7.48725,,#3960,Karb 2020,,
Cumulative plasma HIV burden disparities among adults in HIV care: implications for HIV transmission in the era of treatment as prevention,"Hughes, Alison J.; Rector, Amadeia; Jimenez, Veronica; Brock, Jon; Scheer, Susan","OBJECTIVE: To characterize disparities in cumulative plasma HIV burden in a sample of adults accessing HIV care in San Francisco, California.DESIGN: Observational cohort and supplemental HIV surveillance data.METHODS: Data from the San Francisco Medical Monitoring Project 2012-2014 cycles and HIV surveillance data were used to create an analytic cohort followed for 2 years. Matched HIV viral load test results from HIV surveillance were used to create five viral outcome measures: any unsuppressed viral load (>200 copies/ml), any transmittable viral load (>1500 copies/ml), person-time spent unsuppressed, person-time spent transmittable, and 2-year viremia copy-years, a measure of cumulative plasma HIV burden. Rao-Scott chi-squares and analysis of variance examined differences in durable suppression and mean percentage time spent unsuppressed and transmittable. Weighted linear regression was used to describe differences in cumulative HIV burden.RESULTS: Adults receiving HIV care spent approximately 12% of the 2-year time period with an unsuppressed viral load and approximately 7% of the time at a transmittable viral level. Factors independently associated with higher cumulative HIV viremia in an adjusted model included trans women identity, younger age, lower CD4 cell count, and a history of homelessness, incarceration, not taking ART, and nonadherence to ART.CONCLUSION: Although 95% of the cohort of adults in HIV care in San Francisco self-reported ART use during MMP interview, they spent on average almost 1 month per year at a transmittable viral level. We identified characteristics of those who were more likely to have higher viral burden, highlighting priorities for resource allocation to reduce onward HIV transmission.",2018,,AIDS,32,13,1881-1889,,10.1097/QAD.0000000000001914,,#3961,Hughes 2018,,
Lifetime Syphilis Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors Among Female Prisoners in Brazil,"da Silva Santana, Rosane; Kerr, Ligia; Mota, Rosa Salani; Kendall, Carl; Rutherford, George; McFarland, Willi","BACKGROUND: In 2016, approximately 42,000 women were incarcerated in Brazil. The objectives of this study were to measure the lifetime prevalence of syphilis and sociodemographic and behavior correlates of antibody positivity among female prisoners in Brazil.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1327 incarcerated women in 2014 to 2015 sampled through a multistage cluster design to represent the penitentiary system throughout Brazil. A rapid treponemal antibody test approved by the Ministry of Health (Rapid Test DPP Sífilis Bio-Manguinhos) was used to detect lifetime history of infection. Analyses were adjusted using weights based on the inverse of the product of the probabilities of the sampling units at each stage of the design. Variables significantly associated with syphilis infection at P < 0.05 in multivariate analyses were retained in the final model.RESULTS: Prevalence of syphilis antibody among female prisoners in Brazil was 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8%-13.8%). Higher syphilis prevalence was associated with black/Afro-Brazilian or mixed race/ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.10-2.87), homelessness (AOR, 4.58; 95% CI, 2.78-7.56), abortion (AOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02-2.38), and sexual violence (AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.49). Syphilis prevalence was lower among women who had received condoms in school (AOR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-1.00) as a marker for reproductive health education.CONCLUSIONS: Women within the vast Brazilian prison system demonstrate a high lifetime cumulative incidence of syphilis.

We identified 129 people meeting the case definition; 116 (90%) reported injection drug use. Molecular surveillance added 36 cases to the outbreak not otherwise linked. The 2 largest molecular groups contained 56 and 23 cases. Most interviewed PWID were homeless. Control measures, including enhanced field epidemiology, syringe services programming, and community outreach, resulted in a significant decline in new HIV diagnoses.Conclusions. We illustrate difficulties with identification and characterization of an outbreak of HIV infection among a population of PWID and the value of an intensive response.Public Health Implications.

The development of the Police Practices Scale: Understanding policing approaches towards street-based female sex workers in a U.S. City,"Footer, Katherine H. A.; Park, Ju Nyeong; Rouhani, Saba; Galai, Noya; Silberzahn, Bradley E.; Huettner, Steven; Allen, Sean T.; Sherman, Susan G.","Policing is an important structural determinant of HIV and other health risks faced by vulnerable populations, including people who sell sex and use drugs, though the role of routine police encounters is not well understood. Given the influence of policing on the risk environment of these groups, methods of measuring the aggregate impact of routine policing practices are urgently required. We developed and validated a novel, brief scale to measure police patrol practices (Police Practices Scale, PPS) among 250 street-based female sex workers (FSW) in Baltimore, Maryland, an urban setting with high levels of illegal drug activity. PPS items were developed from existing theory and ethnography with police and their encounters with FSW, and measured frequency of recent (past 3 months) police encounters. The 6-item scale was developed using exploratory factor analysis after examining the properties of the original 11 items. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to model the factor structure. A 2-factor model emerged, with law enforcement PPS items and police assistance PPS items loading on separate factors. Linear regression models were used to explore the relative distribution of these police encounters among FSW by modeling association with key socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics of the sample. Higher exposure to policing was observed among FSW who were homeless (β = 0.71, p = 0.037), in daily sex work (β = 1.32, p = 0.026), arrested in the past 12 months (β = 1.44, p<0.001) or injecting drugs in the past 3 months (β = 1.04, p<0.001). The PPS provides an important and novel contribution in measuring aggregate exposure to routine policing, though further validation is required.

L.; LaRochelle, Marc R.; Bettano, Amy; Bernson, Dana; Beckwith, Curt G.; Linas, Benjamin P.; Walley, Alexander Y.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: While prescribed and illicit opioid use are primary drivers of the national surges in overdose deaths, opioid overdose deaths in which stimulants are also present are increasing in the U.S. We determined the social determinants and sociodemographic factors associated with opioid-only versus polysubstance opioid overdose deaths in Massachusetts. Particular attention was focused on the role of stimulants in opioid overdose deaths.METHODS: We analyzed all opioid-related overdose deaths from 2014 to 2015 in an individually-linked population database in Massachusetts. We used linked postmortem toxicology data to identify drugs present at the time of death. We constructed a multinomial logistic regression model to identify factors associated with three mutually exclusive overdose death groups based on toxicological results: opioid-related deaths with (1) opioids only present, (2) opioids and other substances not including stimulants, and (3) opioids and stimulants with or without other substances.RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2015, there were 2,244 opioid-related overdose deaths in Massachusetts that had accompanying toxicology results. Toxicology reports indicated that 17% had opioids only, 36% had opioids plus stimulants, and 46% had opioids plus another non-stimulant substance. Persons older than 24 years, non-rural residents, those with comorbid mental illness, non-Hispanic black residents, and persons with recent homelessness were more likely than their counterparts to die with opioids and stimulants than opioids alone.CONCLUSIONS: Polysubstance opioid overdose is increasingly common in the US. Addressing modifiable social determinants of health, including barriers to mental health services and homelessness, is important to reduce polysubstance use and overdose deaths.",2019,,Drug Alcohol Depend,200,,59-63,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.014,,#3965,Barocas 2019,,
"Social Vulnerability in Congenital Syphilis Case Mothers: Qualitative Assessment of Cases in Indiana, 2014 to 2016","DiOrio, Dawne; Kroeger, Karen; Ross, Amara","BACKGROUND: Congenital syphilis occurs when a pregnant woman with syphilis is not diagnosed or treated and the infection is passed in utero, causing severe infant morbidity and mortality. Congenital syphilis is easily prevented if women receive timely and adequate prenatal care. Cases of congenital syphilis are considered indicators of problems in the safety net. However, maternal social and behavioral factors can impede women's care, even when providers follow guidelines.METHODS: We reviewed case interviews and maternal records for 23 congenital syphilis cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from Indiana between 2014 and 2016. We used qualitative methods to analyze narrative notes from maternal interviews to learn more about factors that potentially contributed to congenital syphilis cases.RESULTS: All providers followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state recommendations for screening and treatment for pregnant women with syphilis. Twenty-one of 23 women had health insurance. The number of prenatal care visits women had was suboptimal; more than one third of women had no prenatal care. Nearly one third of women's only risk factor was sex with a primary male sex partner. The majority of women suffered social vulnerabilities, including homelessness, substance abuse, and incarceration.CONCLUSIONS: Despite provider adherence to guidelines and health insurance availability, some pregnant women with syphilis are unlikely to receive timely diagnosis and treatment. Pregnant women at high risk for syphilis may need additional social and material support to prevent a congenital syphilis case. Additional efforts are needed to reach the male partners of vulnerable females with syphilis.",2018,,Sex Transm Dis,45,7,447-451,,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000783,,#3966,DiOrio 2018,,
"Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in 20 homeless shelters in Toronto, Canada, from April to July 2020: a repeated cross-sectional study","Kiran, Tara; Craig-Neil, Amy; Das, Paul; Lockwood, Joel; Wang, Ri; Nathanielsz, Nikki; Rosenthal, Esther; Snider, Carolyn; Hwang, Stephen W.","BACKGROUND: It is unclear what the best strategy is for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among residents of homeless shelters and what individual factors are associated with testing positive for the virus. We sought to evaluate factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among residents of homeless shelters and to evaluate positivity rates in shelters where testing was conducted in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks or for surveillance.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart audit to obtain repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between Apr. 1 and July 31, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate for shelters where testing was conducted because of an outbreak (at least 1 known case) with those tested for surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis evaluated differences in demographic, health and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at shelters with at least 2 positive cases.RESULTS: One thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate. Shelter residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly less likely to have a health insurance card (54% v. 72%, p = 0.03) or to have visited another shelter in the last 14 days (0% v. 18%, p < 0.01). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and medical history or symptoms.INTERPRETATION: Our findings support testing of asymptomatic shelter residents for SARS-CoV-2 when a positive case is identified at the same shelter. Surveillance testing when there are no known positive cases may detect outbreaks, but further research should identify efficient strategies given scarce testing resources.",2021,,CMAJ Open,9,1,E302-E308,,10.9778/cmajo.20200253,,#3967,Kiran 2021,,
"An eight-year epidemiologic study of head and neck tuberculosis in Texas, USA","Qian, Xu; Nguyen, Duc T.; Albers, Andreas E.; Dong, Yue; Lyu, Jianxin; Meng, Qing H.; Bi, Xiaohong; Graviss, Edward A.","BACKGROUND: Head and neck tuberculosis (HNTB) especially cervical lymphadenopathy are the most common extrapulmonary indications of TB, but remain a diagnostic challenge. In this study, we describe and analyze the epidemiologic characteristics of HNTB on a population-level.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 547 HNTB cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's TB Genotyping Information Management System in Texas from 2009 to 2016 and compare and contrast differences between diagnosed exclusively HNTB and HNTB with concurrent pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).RESULTS: The majority of patients with HNTB were diagnosed with cervical lymphadenopathy (96.9%), age 25-44 (47.3%) and female (52.7%). Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus, being homeless, excessive alcohol use within the past 12 months and drug use were more frequently seen for HNTB with concurrent pulmonary involvement compared to reported patients with exclusively HNTB. The highest prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage in exclusively HNTB was Euro-American L4 (52.3%), followed by Indo-Oceanic L1 (21.5%) and East-Asian L2 (13.1%). One multidrug resistant TB case was identified. Seven deaths were reported during treatment.CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HNTB and characteristics associated with the disease at the population-level, which is important in managing HNTB patients.",2019,,Tuberculosis (Edinb),116S,,S71-S77,,10.1016/j.tube.2019.04.013,,#3968,Qian 2019,,
Assessing Racial Disparities in HCV Infection and Care Outcomes in a Southern Urban Population,"McGonigle, Keanan; Carley, Tess; Hoff, Clarissa","OBJECTIVES: This study assessed racial disparities in access to healthcare services, hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure, and retention in a treatment cascade in two indigent populations in an urban center in the Southern US.PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Opt-in HCV antibody screening was offered at two large homeless centers and three residential substance abuse treatment centers (SATCs) in New Orleans, LA. Five hundred ninety-four participants experiencing homelessness and 342 residents of SATCs were assessed for previous access/perceived barriers to healthcare services and high-risk behaviors associated with HCV exposure. Participants were then screened using rapid HCV antibody testing and tracked through a treatment cascade involving referral to a primary care provider (PCP), RNA confirmation, and specialist referral.RESULTS: In both the homeless and SATC populations, whites were more likely to report barriers to accessing healthcare and high-risk behaviors, especially prior intravenous drug use (IVDU). Interaction between age and race demonstrates a protective effect of white ethnicity at higher ages, at a level approaching statistical significance. Non-whites were equally likely to access follow-up care and treatment as whites.CONCLUSIONS: Despite many more risk factors reported by the white population, HCV antibody positivity was largely equal between the two racial groups. Known interactions between race and age in the African American population were demonstrated in these high-risk, urban populations. Whites were no more likely to achieve various levels of a treatment and care cascade. The results may demonstrate the impact of improved access to testing services and primary care, although access to treatment remains a significant barrier to eliminating racial disparities in HCV infection.",2018,,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,5,5,1052-1058,,10.1007/s40615-017-0453-y,,#3969,McGonigle 2018,,
Healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with hepatitis A in the United States: a retrospective database analysis,"Samant, Salome; Chen, Edith; Carias, Cristina; Kujawski, Stephanie A.","AIM: To investigate hepatitis A-related healthcare resource use and costs in the US.METHODS: The Merative Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters database was retrospectively analyzed for hepatitis A-related inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department (ED) claims from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2018. We calculated the hepatitis A incidence proportion per 100,000 enrollees, healthcare resource utilization, and costs (in 2020 USD). Results were stratified by age, gender, and select comorbidities.RESULTS: The overall hepatitis A incidence proportion was 6.1 per 100,000 enrollees. Among individuals with ≥1 hepatitis A-related claim, the majority (92.6%) had ≥1 outpatient visit related to hepatitis A; 9.1% were hospitalized and 4.2% had ≥1 ED visit. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) length of hospital stay was 5.2 (8.1) days; the mean (SD) number of outpatient and ED visits were 1.3 (1.3) and 1.1 (0.6), respectively. The incidence proportion per 100,000 was higher among adults than children (7.5 vs. 1.5), individuals with HIV than those without (126.7 vs. 5.9), and individuals with chronic liver disease than those without (143.6 vs. 3.8). The total mean (SD)/median (interquartile range, IQR) per-patient cost for hepatitis A-related care was $2,520 ($10,899)/$156 ($74-$529) and the mean cost of hospitalization was 18.7 times higher than that of outpatient care ($17,373 vs. $928).LIMITATIONS: The study data included only a commercially insured population and may not be representative of all individuals.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hepatitis A is associated with a substantial economic burden among privately insured individuals in the US.",2024,,J Med Econ,27,1,1046-1052,,10.1080/13696998.2024.2384263,,#3970,Samant 2024,,
Technology Access and Perceptions of Telehealth Services Among Young Adults Involved in the Court System,"Ertl, Melissa M.; Jones, Alexis; Hickson, Robert; Achebe, Ikenna; Gyamfi Ertl, Serwa L.; Sichel, Corianna E.; Campos, Stephanie; O'Grady, Megan A.; Tross, Susan; Wilson, Patrick; Cohall, Renee M.; Cohall, Alwyn T.; Elkington, Katherine S.","PURPOSE: This study examined access to technology and telehealth among young adults (ages 18-24) who were court-involved and were recruited from an alternative sentencing program in New York City.METHODS: Using sequential mixed methods design, we examined demographic factors linked with access to technology and perceived usefulness of the Internet among n = 321 young adults who were court-involved (75% male, 65% African American, 35% Latinx). We then conducted in-depth interviews with 27 young adults to elicit first-person account of their access to, interest in, and experience with technology and telehealth.RESULTS: Although most participants had access to a phone with a data plan, a substantial proportion reported inconsistent access to the technology critical to telehealth. Certain young adults were more likely to lack consistent access to the technology needed for telehealth, including Black young adults, males, those with less than a high school diploma, those with a history of homelessness, and those who had difficulties paying for basic necessities. Qualitative interviews revealed that most had a strong self-efficacy using technology, while distrust of technology, inexperience with and skepticism of telehealth, low perceived need for care, and medical mistrust were common significant barriers in this underserved population.DISCUSSION: Findings underscored the critical need to address medical mistrust and increase access to and utilization of care among young adults who are court-involved. Results can inform the development and implementation of interventions designed to improve accessibility and acceptability of telehealth.",2024,,J Adolesc Health,74,3,582-590,,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2023.09.019,,#3971,Ertl 2024,,
Association of maternal risk factors with infant maltreatment: an administrative data cohort study,"Smith, Jennifer N.; Guttmann, Astrid; Kopp, Alexander; Vandermorris, Ashley; Shouldice, Michelle; Harron, Katie L.","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the risk of infant maltreatment associated with commonly used criteria for home visiting programmes: young maternal age, maternal adversity (homelessness, substance abuse, intimate partner violence), newcomer status and mental health concerns in Ontario, Canada.DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included infants born in hospital in Ontario from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2017 captured in linked health administrative and demographic databases. Infants were followed from newborn hospitalisation until 1 year of age for child maltreatment captured in healthcare or death records. The association between type and number of maternal risk factors, and maltreatment, was analysed using multivariable logistic regression modelling, controlling for infant characteristics and material deprivation. Further modelling explored the association of each year of maternal age with maltreatment.RESULTS: Of 989 586 infants, 434 (0.04%) had recorded maltreatment. Maternal age <22 years conferred higher risk of infant maltreatment (adjusted OR (aOR) 5.5, 95% CI 4.5 to 6.8) compared with age ≥22 years. Maternal mental health diagnoses (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.5) were also associated with maltreatment, while refugee status appeared protective (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.0). The odds of maltreatment increased with higher numbers of maternal risk factors. Maternal age was associated with maltreatment until age 28 years.CONCLUSION: Infants born to young mothers are at greater risk of infant maltreatment, and this association remained until age 28 years. These findings are important for ensuring public health interventions are supporting populations experiencing structural vulnerabilities with the aim of preventing maltreatment.",2023,,Arch Dis Child,109,1,23-29,,10.1136/archdischild-2022-325239,,#3972,Smith 2023,,
