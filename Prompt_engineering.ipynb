    "    You are an expert reviewer for research studies with human-like reasoning. Your goal is to identify empirical studies about youth homelessness interventions that should be considered for inclusion.

The project offers vulnerable young people who, all too often, have known only unemployment and low aspiration a chance to get advice and support, to learn basic life skills and to reevaluate their life chances. It was founded in response to youth homelessness in County Durham, England. A study for County Durham Learning estimated that a successful SHAID intervention can result in a saving of £35,586 per annum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \"We're Like A Family\"            2008.0\n",

Living conditions and background circumstances, such as history of abuse, lack of education, or ethnic background, may lead SY to engage in high risk behaviors such as unsafe sexual practices and substance abuse. Previous studies have shown that SY's access to basic health care services is inequitable compared to their peers in the general population. Consequently, SY who are unable to access health services are more likely to report high risk behaviors. In this study we describe the barriers faced by Toronto SY in accessing health care services and how perception of barriers differs by demographics, physical and mental health, and history of abuse.                                                                                                                                                                   153.

n = 32) and street youth (SY; n = 75) with varying degrees of CW involvement (thirty-two involved with CW; eighteen Crown wards). SY-CrownWards experienced more interpersonal violence and mental health concerns. SY with histories of CW involvement had higher pregnancy rates.

Methods: Encounter data were used to identify REACH clients and a control group that was matched by propensity score. Mental health services costs for case management, outpatient services, inpatient and emergency services, criminal justice system services, and total services were summarized for two-year periods before and after clients initiated REACH. Incremental costs of the program were calculated as the difference in cost among clients in the REACH group, from pre- to postintervention, less the difference in cost among those in the control group from pre- to postintervention. Results: A total of 177 REACH clients and 161 clients in a control group matched by propensity score were identified. Among REACH participants, case management costs increased by $6,403 (p<.001) from pre- to postintervention, inpatient plus emergency services costs declined by $6,103 (p=.034), and costs for mental health services provided by the criminal justice system declined by $570 (p=.020) compared with the control group. The standardized difference-in-difference estimate of the total costs between REACH clients and the control group was not significant. Conclusions: Participation in REACH was associated with substantial increases in outpatient services as well as cost offsets in inpatient and emergency services and criminal justice system services. The net cost of services, $417 over two years, was substantially lower than the total cost of services ($20,241).

The use of a fortified food easy to eat in the street was identified as the best strategy to improve nutrient intake in this population. A fortified street food was therefore designed and its acceptability was tested in eight emergency centers.\\n\\nResults: The dietary survey showed that there is a high frequency of malnutrition and inadequate intake of vitamins and minerals in homeless men in France although they are receiving food aid. A chocolate-flavored spread, naturally rich in potassium and n-3 fatty acids and fortified with nutritional doses of calcium, zinc, vitamins C, D, E, B12, thiamin, niacin and folic acid was designed. It presents multiple advantages in the context of homeless nutrition: good resistance to bacterial contamination, a suitable viscosity for people with limited chewing capacity and high energy density. The acceptability study showed that approximately two thirds of the homeless men visiting emergency centers in Paris would consume the fortified food often, or daily, if available. Another advantage of this fortified street food is its high quality/price ratio, demonstrated by linear programming analysis in the present study.\\n\\nConclusions: Encouraging the use of fortified street foods in food aid programs is a practical and economic way to prevent nutritional deficiencies in homeless individuals.

The aim of this exploratory study was to describe LGBT youth residing in a TLP, including the reasons for exit from home of origin, abuse and victimization, sexual risk behaviors, physical and mental health, suicidal ideation and attempts, substance use, and resilience. This was a secondary data analysis of a longitudinal design. The study population was a TLP exclusively for LGBT homeless youth age 18-24 in New York City. All eligible residents were selected. The sample size was 30. The response rate was 82%. At one month, 27 participants remained in the study, and at three month measure 16 participants remained. Attrition from the study was due to discharge, or exit, from the program. Data were obtained from the program intake form, monthly client progress reports, and a monthly interview. The sample was racially heterogeneous, the majority was male, and there were only two lesbians. The majority of respondents had left their home of origin by choice (n=16), had experienced verbal (n=25) and physical (n=20) abuse by a parent, and reported a clinically significant depression (n=17) and anxiety (n=10). The number of sexual partners, incidence of sex work, substance use, and suicidal ideation and attempts was very low while in the program. Risky sexual behaviors were reported, including prior sex work (n=17), and not consistently using condoms or other barriers when having sex with someone they just met (n=13) or while drunk or high (n=9). Most had been tested for HIV (n=27) and many had been tested for hepatitis C (n=23). Levels of social support and self-efficacy were moderate when measured at intake, but decreased at one month measure (p<.001). Gay males reported slightly higher self-efficacy at one month measure compared to lesbian, bisexual, and queer participants (p=.02). This exploratory study demonstrates that this population is willing to engage in longitudinal research and found the study measures acceptable. Future studies should include larger samples of LGBT youth residing in TLPs and should examine the effectiveness of different program components so that evidence-supported interventions can be developed for this underserved population.

This study both describes a home-visiting intervention for young sexually assaulted runaways (10–14 years old) and provides preliminary outcomes from the first 20 female participants. Design and Methods—Using a strengths-based approach, advanced practice nurses provided frequent home and school visits and case management, and assisted girls to access an empowerment group over a 1 year period. Results—Teens’ risk behaviors decreased, including truancy, runaway episodes, sexually transmitted infections, and substance use. Conclusions—Preliminary results suggest that this is an effective intervention for reducing risk behaviors and helping younger runaways reconnect to school and family.

Early identification and intervention may decrease risk associated with delayed development. Parent-completed measures have been used to help screen for children's development, but little is known about how they may enhance early detection with homeless children. The primary aims of this pilot study were to describe growth and developmental characteristics of homeless children and to compare a parent-completed measure with professionally-conducted developmental screening results. A prospective, comparative study was conducted with 20 homeless mothers and their 21 children. Health professionals used the Denver Developmental Screening Test II, identifying nine children with possible language delay. Mothers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaires and identified three areas of concern: fine motor ( n = 9), communication/language ( n = 4), and problem solving ( n = 4). The percentage agreement between these two tools was strongest in gross motor (95%) and personal social development (95%) but weakest in language development (67%). While it is essential for all children, developmental screening is particularly crucial for homeless children because of increased risks related to poverty and homelessness. Nurses and nurse practitioners are in a unique position to assess applicability of such instruments and to provide critically needed interventions for these children.

Findings were that 50% of respondents attended college at some point. Youth reported having 2 or 3 jobs a year with at least one bout of unemployment. Most of the non-college bound youth reported working in low-wage unskilled jobs that did not appear to be career oriented. Almost 75% of former residents had at least one connection to the adult world through school, work, or marriage one year after discharge. This rate had climbed to 96% at the 36-month interview. Respondents were reporting much lower rates of criminal justice involvement, homelessness, and victimization than found in other studies of discharged foster youth.

We sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of enrollment in addiction treatment among a cohort of street-involved youths and young adults in Vancouver, Canada. Street-involved youths and young adults who use illicit drugs were enrolled in a prospective cohort study known as the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS). We examined the prevalence of addiction treatment experience and identified the factors associated with this outcome using multivariate logistic regression. Among 478 participants, 243 (50.8%) had previously been enrolled in some form of addiction treatment program. In multivariate analysis, history of overdose, previous incarceration, crack use, cocaine use, and history of injection drug use were positively and independently associated with enrollment in addiction treatment. These findings may assist health authorities in identifying and assisting youths who may have barriers to accessing treatment, and further suggest that efforts may be needed to scale up addiction treatment programming for high-risk youths and young adults.

This proof‐of‐concept study explored the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, low‐cost, telephone‐delivered program. Design and Methods. Clients aged over 18 years, English‐speaking and currently receiving accommodation support from a homelessness outreach centre were invited to participate in a ‘Phone for Health’ program. Six sessions conducted once per week provided participants with personalised counselling about smoking cessation or reduction, as well as fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol use, physical activity and sun protection. Both clients and staff completed follow‐up quantitative surveys, and clients completed qualitative interviews. Results. Of 14 eligible participants, 12 consented to taking part and completed baseline measures, 10 commenced the telephone intervention and six completed the intervention program. Average length of telephone sessions was 17.8 min and participants completed an average of 3.8 sessions. Findings suggested high acceptability with most participants reporting that the Phone for Health program helped them meet their smoking reduction goals, and was convenient, useful and practical. Most participants reported making changes to their health risk behaviours as a result of taking part in the program. Discussion and Conclusions. Telephone delivery of the smoking cessation and other health behaviours intervention was acceptable and feasible. The results provide pragmatic lessons for the development of future health research and practice with an underserved population markedly difficult to reach and engage.[Bonevski B, Baker A, Twyman L, Paul C, Bryant J.

an urban joint-use library's approaches to library programs for homeless children, teens, and adults as well as agencies the library could partner with. Proposes that libraries put more effort into reaching out to the homeless community instead of assuming the normal expectation that people will come to the library.

The first group attended agencies in low-income Hispanic neighborhoods which recruited within the locale. The second group of youth attended agencies that recruited based upon a specific population—they targeted homeless and LGBQ youth. We explored the characteristics of adolescents who sought initial services, the types of services requested, and attitudes toward the centers. Results indicated that those who utilized the population-based agencies were more likely to be homeless, have higher depression scores, and be older. They reported coming to the agency to find a safe place, whereas those who utilized the neighborhood-based agencies came specifically for concrete services.

Using concepts from self psychology, 12 young adults between the ages of 18 and 26 participated in a semi-structured qualitative interview to gather information regarding their experiences prior to, during, and since having exited substitute care and completed a standardized measure of current functioning. Underlying subjects’ experiences is a pervasive sense of repeated disappointment from relationships and efforts to find idealizable others.

Research conducted by the McCreary Centre Society (a British Columbia non-profit organization concerned with youth health) has shown that even the most vulnerable youth who feel connected to school are more likely to report better health and above average marks, and to engage in fewer risky activities, than youth who feel less connected to school. However, recognizing that not all youth thrive in a mainstream academic setting, many school districts offer a range of alternative education programs aimed at serving not only the academic but also the vocational, social, and emotional needs of their students. What are the experiences of young people attending alternative education programs? The authors set out to address this question by canvassing youth in B.C. communities with a high prevalence of youth street-involvement and sexual exploitation. The focus was on youth in alternative education programs designed for students considered at \"high-risk\" for educational disengagement. This study complemented McCreary's marginalized and street-involved youth study (\"Against the Odds\", 2007) and aimed to explore the experiences of youth who attend alternative education programs and to look at the role alternative education programs play in the lives of youth who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. This study highlights the fact that students in alternative education programs face many challenges, yet most feel connected to school and have positive academic aspirations. Alternative education programs are assisting youth academically as well as vocationally and socially. However, as McCreary's study of street-involved youth demonstrated, many of the most vulnerable youth are still not connected with any of the education programs available to them. If alternative education programs and communities build on their successes, they could reach out to even more high-risk youth.

Although the initial passing and subsequent revisions to McKinney-Vento are depicted as providing numerous benefits for students who are homeless, its full actualization is seen to be inhibited by several intra- and interorganizational leadership issues at school, community, and state levels. After analyzing some of the common barriers to McKinney-Vento’s full implementation, several recommendations and implications for practice are posited.

Canada has a noteworthy reputation for high quality health care. Nonetheless, street youth are one of our most vulnerable yet underserved populations. Consequently, a medical and dental clinic was created in downtown Ottawa, Ontario to respond to their needs. The purpose of this study is to describe a process evaluation of the clinic during its first year of operation with a focus on program fidelity, dose, reach, and satisfaction. A mixed methods approach was used involving interviews with providers, focus groups with street youth, analysis of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, and supplemental information such as document reviews. The evaluation identified areas that were working well along with challenges to program implementation. Areas of concerns and possible solutions were presented to the management team that then helped to plan and make improvements to the clinic. Our evaluation design and working relationship with clinic management promoted the integration of real-time evidence into program improvements.

Our objective was to pilot a novel patient-centered intervention for high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions to determine its potential to improve care and reduce costs. Community and hospital-based care management and coordination intervention with pre-post analysis of health care utilization. We enrolled Medicaid fee-for-service patients aged 18-64 who were admitted to an urban public hospital and identified as being at high risk for hospital readmission by a validated predictive algorithm. Enrolled patients were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative interview techniques to identify needs such as transportation to/advocacy during medical appointments, mental health/substance use treatment, and home visits. A community housing partner initiated housing applications in-hospital for homeless patients. Care managers facilitated appropriate discharge plans then worked closely with patients in the community using a harm reduction approach. Nineteen patients were enrolled; all were male, 18/19 were substance users, and 17/19 were homeless. Patients had a total of 64 inpatient admissions in the 12 months before the intervention, versus 40 in the following 12 months, a 37.5% reduction. Most patients (73.3%) had fewer inpatient admissions in the year after the intervention compared to the prior year. Overall ED visits also decreased after study enrollment, while outpatient clinic visits increased. Yearly study hospital Medicaid reimbursements fell an average of $16,383 per patient. A pilot intervention for high-cost patients shows promising results for health services usage. We are currently expanding our model to serve more patients at additional hospitals to see if the pilot's success can be replicated.

This study examined school counselors' involvement in partnership practices and interventions to meet the needs of students who are homeless. Further, this study explored relationships between school counselors' preparation to work with students who are homeless, their perceived knowledge of McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and their involvement in partnership practices and interventions to work with students who are homeless. An online questionnaire, which was a combination of the School Counselor Involvement in Partnerships Survey (SCIPS) and the revised Knowledge and Skills with Homeless Students Survey (KSHSS) was emailed to a random sample of American School Counselor Association (ASCA) members. Further, descriptive statistics and regression analyses were run to determine relationships between variables. The results of the study suggested that school counselors are involved in practices to support students who are homeless that are more individual and school-based. They are involved less in practices that require collaboration and partnerships.

This study examined school counselors’ involvement in partnership practices and interventions to meet the needs of students who are homeless. Further, this study explored relationships between school counselors' preparation to work with students who are homeless, their perceived knowledge of McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and their involvement in partnership practices and interventions to work with students who are homeless. An online questionnaire, which was a combination of the School Counselor Involvement in Partnerships Survey (SCIPS) and the revised Knowledge and Skills with Homeless Students Survey (KSHSS) was emailed to a random sample of American School Counselor Association (ASCA) members. Further, PREVIEW descriptive statistics and regression analyses were run to determine relationships between variables. The results of the study suggested that school counselors are involved in practices to support students who are homeless that are more individual and school-based. They are involved less in practices that require collaboration and partnerships. The results of this research also suggest that there are relationships between school counselors’ perceptions of their specific knowledge of homelessness, self-efficacy, and advocacy role and their involvement in interventions and partnership practices to support students who homeless  An Investigation Of School Counselors' Efforts To Serve Students Who Are Homeless: The Role Of Perceived Knowledge, Preparation, Advocacy Role, And Self-Efficacy To Their Involvement In Recommended Interventions And Partnership Practices            2012.0\n",

Factors leading to homelessness are explored and examples of the positive influence of art for children experiencing crisis and trauma are presented. Through action research, an art program was implemented where children worked with ceramics, drawing, and writing, twice a week for three and a half weeks. The participants ranged in age from six to fifteen years, with classes conducted as part of their after-school program. Data collected through observations, interviews, and the students’ work was used to adapt the lessons for diverse ages, abilities, and attendance of the participants. Findings showed the students were able to express themselves through their art visually, by making clay projects that reflected their interests, and verbally, by writing or telling what they were thinking or feeling. The students displayed enthusiasm for making art and exhibited a great deal of pride in what they had accomplished. The results showed that students demonstrated characteristics that have been identified to help foster resiliency in individuals. Helping to develop the joy of learning, creativity, and self-worth are important tools for every child’s growth; however, the use of art as a pathway to develop such characteristics may be even more critical to a child experiencing trauma. Art lessons can provide a positive impact on the lives of children and youth in the fight to break the cycle of homelessness.

Treatment efforts have approached the problemfrom a damage model that focuses on pathology anddeficits instead of strengthening coping skills and resiliency.This study utilized both quantitative (N=212) and qualitative(n=3) measures to examine the function of creativity andart making with respect to resiliency in homeless youth whowere attending a drop-in art center. Quantitative methodsidentified a strong correlation between an individual's engagementin creative activity and his or her life achievement.Individual stories derived from interviews and drawings illustratehow participants valued the role of art in making healthylifestyle choices.

Housing instability and food insecurity represent milder and more prevalent forms of homelessness and hunger. The aim of this study was to determine the association between housing instability and food insecurity with children's health care access and acute health care utilization. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 12 746 children from low-income households included in the 2002 National Survey of America's Families (NSAF). In multivariate models controlling for important covariates, we measured the association between housing instability and food insecurity with 3 health care access measures: 1) no usual source of care, 2) postponed medical care, and 3) postponed medications. We also measured 3 health care utilization measures: 1) not receiving the recommended number of well-child care visits, 2) increased emergency department visits, and 3) hospitalizations. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 29.5% of low-income children lived in households with housing instability and 39.0% with food insecurity. In multivariate logistic regression models, housing instability was independently associated with postponed medical care, postponed medications, and increased emergency department visits. Food insecurity was independently associated with no usual source of care, postponed medical care, postponed medications, and not receiving the recommended well-child care visits. CONCLUSION: Families that experience housing instability and food insecurity, without necessarily experiencing homelessness or hunger, have compromised ability to receive adequate health care for their children. Policy makers should consider improving programs that decrease housing instability and food insecurity, and clinicians should consider screening for housing instability and food insecurity so as to provide comprehensive care.

There are few published studies investigating asthma in homeless children. This study examines the perspectives of both caregivers and shelter staff regarding challenges and opportunities of caring for children with asthma.\\n\\nMethods: A focus group of sheltered parents (n = 10) with children who have asthma was conducted to identify barriers to optimal asthma management. Key informant interviews (n = 6) were conducted with shelter staff to discuss the shelter systems and policies to address childhood asthma. Data were audio-recorded and transcribed. A representative analysis team performed qualitative theme analysis.\\n\\nResults: Key themes across 5 domains were identified: asthma education, access to asthma medication and equipment, asthma action plans, structural barriers to asthma management and environmental triggers. Parents identified multiple asthma triggers present in the shelter environment but cited lack of control as a barrier to remediation. Shelter staff desired elimination of asthma triggers but refer to the lack of resources as the primary barrier. Shelter staff favored a smoking ban on shelter property but named challenges to policy implementation. Both parents and staff identified asthma education and increased access to medications would be helpful.\\n\\nConclusions: Policies to reduce environmental exposures, such as a smoking ban, to asthma triggers has the potential to improve the health of sheltered children with asthma.\\n                                                                                                                                           Asthma, Tobacco Smoke And The Indoor Environment: A Qualitative Study Of Sheltered Homeless Families            2014.0\n",

This paper reports baseline findings from an ongoing longitudinal study assessing factors associated with a successful transition out of homelessness. Fifty-one formerly homeless youth who obtained stable housing in the past 2 months to 2 years participated in this study which took place in two Canadian urban centres. Findings include poorer functioning across all domains for youth residing in housing contexts without supports, a lack of relationship between psychological and behavioural aspects of community integration, and the central role of self-concept in mental health and quality of life. These findings suggest the need for ongoing support for youth exiting street spaces and social contexts, with attention to the importance of self-concept and psychological aspects of community integration.

This paper examines the extent of separations of children from parents and of partners from each other and whether housing and service interventions reduced separations and their precursors among 1,857 families across 12 sites who participated in the Family Options Study. Families in shelters were randomized to offers of one of three interventions: permanent housing subsidies that reduce expenditures for rent to 30% of families’ income, temporary rapid re‐housing subsidies with some services directed at housing and employment, and transitional housing in supervised facilities with extensive psychosocial services. Each group was compared to usual care families who were eligible for that intervention but received no special offer. Twenty months later, permanent housing subsidies almost halved rates of child separation and more than halved rates of foster care placements; the other interventions did not affect separations significantly. Predictors of separation were primarily homelessness and drug abuse (all comparisons), and alcohol dependence (one comparison). Although housing subsidies reduced homelessness, alcohol dependence, intimate partner violence, and economic stressors, the last three variables had no association with child separations in the subsidy comparison; thus subsidies had indirect effects via reductions in homelessness.

Without empirical data on these reasons, the policies developed or implemented to mitigate street involvement are not responsive to the needs of these children and youth. OBJECTIVE: To systematically analyze the self-reported reasons why children and youth around the world become street-involved and to analyze the available data by level of human development, geographic region, and sex. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of Scopus, PsychINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, PubMed, ERIC, and the Social Sciences Citation Index were conducted from January 1, 1990, to the third week of July 2013. We searched the peer-reviewed literature for studies that reported quantitative reasons for street involvement. The following broad search strategy was used to search the databases: “street children” OR “street youth” OR “homeless youth” OR “homeless children” OR “runaway children” OR “runaway youth” or “homeless persons.” STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) participants were 24 years of age or younger, (2) participants met our definition of street-connected children and youth, and (3) the quantitative reasons for street involvement were reported. We reviewed 318 full texts and identified 49 eligible studies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. We fit logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the pooled prevalence of each reason and to estimate subgroup pooled prevalence by development level or geographic region. The meta-analysis was conducted from February to August 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We created the following categories based on the reported reasons in the literature: poverty, abuse, family conflict, delinquency, psychosocial health, and other. RESULTS: In total, there were 13 559 participants from 24 countries, of which 21 represented developing countries. The most commonly reported reason for street involvement was poverty, with a pooled-prevalence estimate of 39% (95% CI, 29%-51%). Forty-seven studies included in this review reported family conflict as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 32% (95% CI, 26%-39%). Abuse was equally reported in developing and developed countries as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 26% (95% CI, 18%-35%). Delinquency was the least frequently cited reason overall, with a pooled prevalence of 10% (95% CI, 5%-20%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The street-connected children and youth who provided reasons for their street involvement infrequently identified delinquent behaviors for their circumstances and highlighted the role of poverty as a driving factor. They require support and protection, and governments globally are called on to reduce the socioeconomic inequities that cause children and youth to turn to the streets in the first place, in all regions of the world.

Although objective evaluation of the program proved difficult, “community” was established and lives were changed. The program was designed to address multiple issues faced by teenaged mothers but did not directly address critical factors of youths' internal motivation and decision-making processes. Attempting to reverse major impediments in the lives of young mothers with histories of violence, abuse, unstable early home environments, and lack of education while assuming the sole responsibility of raising a child, advancing their education, and maintaining employment is a daunting task, but a task that deserves our urgent attention.

Community-based screening may be one strategy in which to reach such persons; however, the acceptance of HCV testing, when many high-risk individuals may not have access to HCV specific medications, remains unknown. We set out to assess attitudes about HCV screening and knowledge about HCV disease at several community-based testing sites that serve high-risk populations. This assessment was paired with a brief HCV educational intervention, followed by post-education evaluation. Participants (n = 140) were surveyed at five sites; two homeless shelters, two drug rehabilitation centers, and a women's \"drop-in\" center. Personal acceptance of HCV testing was almost unanimous, and 90% of participants reported that they would still want to be tested even if they were unable to receive HCV treatment. Baseline hepatitis C knowledge was poor; however, the brief educational intervention significantly improved knowledge and increased acceptability of testing when medical access issues were explicitly stated. Despite inconsistencies in access to care and treatment, high-risk communities want to know their HCV status. Though baseline HCV knowledge was poor in this population, a brief on-site educational intervention improved both knowledge and acceptability of HCV testing and care. These data support the establishment of programs that utilize community-based screening, and also provide initial evidence for acceptance of the implementation of the recently expanded screening guidelines among marginalized communities.

Many face unprecedented challenges like homelessness, lack of financial resources, difficulty accessing educational opportunities, and unemployment. In this issue brief, The American Youth Policy Forum (AYPF) document these challenges and opportunities in three distinct yet overlapping areas of need: (1) Sustainable Social Capital; (2) Permanency Supports; and (3) Postsecondary Opportunities. For each area of need, the authors define the challenges youth face and identify promising programs and policies that are in place to help them transition from foster care to a healthy, successful adult life.

Many face unprecedented challenges like homelessness, lack of financial resources, difficulty accessing educational opportunities, and unemployment. In this issue brief, The American Youth Policy Forum (AYPF) document these challenges and opportunities in three distinct yet overlapping areas of need: (1) Sustainable Social Capital; (2) Permanency Supports; and (3) Postsecondary Opportunities. For each area of need, the authors define the challenges youth face and identify promising programs and policies that are in place to help them transition from foster care to a healthy, successful adult life.

Many face unprecedented challenges like homelessness, lack of financial resources, difficulty accessing educational opportunities, and unemployment. In this issue brief, The American Youth Policy Forum (AYPF) document these challenges and opportunities in three distinct yet overlapping areas of need: (1) Sustainable Social Capital; (2) Permanency Supports; and (3) Postsecondary Opportunities. For each area of need, the authors define the challenges youth face and identify promising programs and policies that are in place to help them transition from foster care to a healthy, successful adult life.

Many face unprecedented challenges like homelessness, lack of financial resources, difficulty accessing educational opportunities, and unemployment. In this issue brief, The American Youth Policy Forum (AYPF) document these challenges and opportunities in three distinct yet overlapping areas of need: (1) Sustainable Social Capital; (2) Permanency Supports; and (3) Postsecondary Opportunities. For each area of need, the authors define the challenges youth face and identify promising programs and policies that are in place to help them transition from foster care to a healthy, successful adult life.

Provides information for other dental services to consider when developing and assessing special care services. Describes how increasing accessibility of dental care to homeless people led to a decrease in the loss of clinical time due to failed or cancelled appointments. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the dental services delivered by the Community Dental Service (CDS) of Tower Hamlets (TH) and City and Hackney (CH) for adult homeless people in 2009-2011, to assess if the service met its planned objectives and to report the outcomes of the dental care provided. Method TH and CH CDS provided a nine tier dental service for homeless people during April 2009 to September 2011, in which the dedicated mobile dental service (MDS) and the dedicated dental clinic (DDS) provided 3,102 dental appointments for homeless people. Data collection from a random sample (n = 350) of record cards of adult patients who were homeless and offered oral care from these services was conducted, in collaboration with an analysis of appointment books, service delivery rotas and day sheets. Patients' oral findings, treatments, challenges as well as feedback received from the service users were recorded and evaluated against the planned objectives. Results One thousand two hundred and twelve (39.1%) of these appointments went to the 350 patients whose record cards were examined as part of this audit. One of the record cards randomly selected had incomplete date and was excluded from the results, so data was presented on the 349 complete record cards. The age range of these patients was 18-74 years, with a mean age of 38.46 years ± 9.1 standard deviation (SD) with 80% of the patients (n = 281) under 50 years of age. Forty percent of these patients presented in pain with a further 5% complaining of swelling and infection, 99% of people required treatment and only nine people had no decay, three of whom were edentulous. Two hundred and thirteen (61%) patients completed their treatments, which took between 1 to 18 appointments, but only 97 (27.8%) patients did so without any failed or cancelled appointments. Of the 128 (36.7%) patients who were lost after the first appointment, only 15 (11.7%) did not receive any treatment; most had been treated for pain with temporary fillings, extractions, permanent fillings and management of swelling. Sixty-seven band 1, 16 band 1.2 (emergency only), 148 band 2 and 52 band 3 courses of treatment were submitted. Conclusion This study showed a significant need for services providing oral healthcare for this population and highlighted that flexibly delivered dental services, embedded in local health and social networks, seemed to promote uptake in these clients who normally find it extremely difficult to find dental care services elsewhere.

First, it was an attempt to gain an understanding of the experiences of fourteen unaccompanied, homeless youth between the ages of 18 and 24, living in the Twin Cities metro area, who have utilized services at two or more of the six grantee organizations. The second purpose was to understand how the shared principles of these organizations have been implemented in practice. The third purpose was to explore the extent to which implementation of these principles helps lead to healthy youth development from the perspective of the youth. This study was conducted as part of The Otto Bremer Foundation (OBF) Support for Homeless Youth and is a component of a utilization-focused developmental evaluation. The researcher employed a multiple case study approach. Qualitative data were generated from interviews with the youths themselves, street workers, agency staff, and Foundation staff. Fourteen individual case studies were written, and a cross-case analysis was conducted. The analysis provides insight into how the principles are enacted, as well as how they support a young person's healthy trajectory. This study found that all nine principles were evident in case stories, albeit some more than others. All principles interacted and overlapped, but each added something unique to the organizations' approach to working with youth.

The policy consists of early intervention efforts with adolescent females to prevent and dissuade them from sex trading. Our framework treats the program as an investment project and calculates its net present value, where the benefits are understood to be harms avoided by successfully reducing the extent of sex trading. We approach the analysis from the narrow perspective of the public budget. That is, both the cost of the program and the specific harms from sex trading are evaluated in terms of the burden they impose on a community’s government expenditures. We do not examine the full social costs of sex trading. Our valuation of harms is a conservative estimate based on available social science data. We conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to key model parameters such as program effectiveness, discount rate and other model parameters. The program returns positive Net Present Value in all but the most pessimistic scenarios, which we believe are highly unlikely to prevail. In our best estimate it returns $34 in benefit for each $1 in cost.

CASS, street‐connected children and street children are some of the terms used to describe this group of children who have some association with the street; such as living, working or loitering for long periods of time on the street. These children are often described as ‘voiceless’; a vulnerable group of children who experience a considerable amount of adversity from a young age.

We explore how former foster youth who aged out of care in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa are faring in the labor market at age 24 and what explains variability in employment and wages for these youth. We utilize multilevel models to analyze youth's employment using four waves of the Midwest Study. Our findings point to a critical need to better understand and address barriers to education, causes of substantial racial disparities, and characteristics of family foster homes that facilitate youths' employment. We find that youth who remain in care past age 18 attain higher educational credentials which translate into better employment outcomes.

By offering residents such services as employment support, financial literacy training and after-school activities, many organizations also effectively propel families to greater social well-being and economic self-sufficiency. CDCs can further strengthen families and communities by working to end family homelessness. Communities are increasingly adopting new strategies to prevent homelessness and to rapidly secure permanent housing for families when they do become homeless. These community-based organizations are shifting practices and achieving results. But substantive progress requires broader networks and commitments, including the expertise and resources of the affordable housing and community development industry.

It was established as a result of evidence from service users and practitioners which suggested that this group of women were unlikely to access mixed emergency accommodation and found it hard to engage with more structured routes into support. The Novas Scarman Group provides a range of services to women and men in housing need within Bristol. Their services include a large women’s hostel which provides services to 150 women annually. Additional consultation about the Night Service provision took place with service providers from One25, Second Step, Alabare (The Well), caring at Christmas and representatives from Safer Bristol. Funding was obtained from the Supporting People Innovations Fund and a donation from Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). Before the project was implemented, it was also fully discussed with relevant neighbourhood partnerships and organisations, including The Compass Centre, St Paul’s Community Partnership, the Hostel Review Group and the Street Sex Workers Action Group. Existing links with the agencies to whom onward referrals were likely to be made were renewed, and a multi-agency advisory group was established to work with the project.

Method: Coding and thematic analysis of semistructured interviews was based on 2 research questions from participants' perspectives: (a) What changes were perceived over time? (b) What factors facilitated or hindered change? Results: The majority of participants assigned to Housing First reported positive change across multiple domains as a result of stable housing; whereas the majority of treatment as usual participants reported negative or neutral change. Key themes included feelings of security and pride; adjusting to living alone; housing as a learning process; and developing meaningful activity. The sense of security associated with stable housing was the most influential factor that supported change. Factors that helped or hindered change clustered into 4 key themes: the type and quality of services; the cumulative effects of trauma; social ties; and concurrent substance use. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Our findings provide important context to the emerging body of quantitative research on Housing First and recovery from homelessness. Participants' experiences of recovery, particularly as it relates to housing and supports, shifts in identity, and meaningful activity must be acknowledged and incorporated into the design and evaluation of public services, and policy and service reforms.

Two recent Harvard graduates, Sam Greenberg and Sarah Rosenkrantz, who had volunteered at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter as college students, saw a need within the Boston and Cambridge communities for a homeless shelter serving young adults. Drawing upon the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter’s student-run model, Sam and Sarah worked with Harvard College undergraduates to open Youth-to-Youth (Y2Y) Harvard Square, a homeless shelter exclusively for young adults ages 18–24.

Variations between strategies existed largely in the degree to which organisations were able to be flexible and/or collaborative in their service delivery.  Offering existing programs/services to new client groups, new programs/services to existing client groups, or new programs/services to new groups was one way in which services were tailored to meet vulnerable families' needs. Several organisations also actively worked with other providers in their local area to prevent service duplication.  Thoughtful responses to the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged families were evident in the majority of documents. Warm (and/or facilitated) referral was a common strategy within the documents to link families to helpful services, as was \"no wrong door\" policies and the use of soft entry points.  There was a great deal of willingness among providers to meet families where they were most comfortable via outreach services. These services took many forms, including actively attending places where vulnerable families and children would be, such as home visits, government services, public housing estates, parks and shopping centres. This paper is an overview of an analysis of the Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Client Access Strategies (Access Strategies), a requirement of service providers funded by the Family Support Program (FSP). Organisations were asked to document and implement the steps they would take to improve service accessibility and responsiveness for vulnerable and disadvantaged families, including Indigenous families. The Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) was commissioned by Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) to undertake a desktop analysis of available Access Strategy documents, in order to collate information on existing/current good or innovative practice utilised by organisations to support vulnerable and disadvantaged families.

This study examined changes in health status, quality of life, substance use, health care utilization, and residential stability among 112 homeless and vulnerably housed individuals who applied to a supportive housing program in Toronto, Canada, from December 2005 to June 2007. Follow-up interviews were conducted every 6 months for 18 months. Comparisons were made between individuals who were accepted into the program (intervention) and those who were wait-listed (usual care) using repeated-measures analyses. Individuals who were accepted into the housing program experienced significantly greater improvements in satisfaction with living situation compared with individuals in the usual care group (time, F 3,3,261  = 47.68, p  < 0.01; group × time, F 3,3,261  = 14.60, p  < 0.01). There were no significant differences in other quality of life measures, health status, health care utilization, or substance use between the two groups over time. Significant improvement in residential stability occurred over time, independent of assigned housing group (time, F 3,3,261  = 9.96, p  < 0.01; group × time, F 3,3,261  = 1.74, p  = 0.17). The ability to examine the effects of supportive housing on homeless individuals was limited by the small number of participants who were literally homeless at baseline and by the large number of participants who gained stable housing during the study period regardless of their assigned housing status.

Many barriers to accessing healthcare have been documented; however, the relative impact of discrete barriers on homeless youth healthcare utilization behavior is not firmly established. We administered a survey examining reported barriers and healthcare utilization among adolescents and young adults accessing services at three community centers for homeless and runaway youth. Of 180 respondents, 57 % were male, 80 % non-White, and 21 % identified as a sexual minority. Stepwise logistic regression models, controlling for age and study site, explored associations between barriers and 3 healthcare utilization outcomes (doctor visit in past 12 months; regular care provider; frequent emergency department (ED) visits). The most commonly reported barriers were “don’t have a ride” (27.2 %), “no insurance” (23.3 %), and “costs too much” (22.8 %). All fear-based barriers (e.g., “I don’t trust the doctors”) were reported by < 5 % of surveyed youth. Significant predictors of having seen a doctor in the past 12 months included sexual minority status (OR 2.8, p = 0.04) and possession of health insurance (OR 4.9, p < 0.001). Female sex (OR 5.2, p < 0.001) and reported external barriers other than health insurance (OR 0.2, p < 0.001) were associated with having a regular care provider. Fear-based concerns were associated (OR 3.8, p = 0.02) with frequent ED visits, as was being insured (OR 2.2, p = 0.03). These results underscore the need to clearly define healthcare outcomes when investigating barriers to care among homeless and runaway youth as the impact of discrete barriers varies depending on outcome of focus.

However, these studies have not attempted to identify potential risk or protective factors that might affect the likelihood of becoming homeless during the transition to adulthood. This paper uses data from a longitudinal study to examine both the occurrence and predictors of homelessness among a sample of young people from three Midwestern states who recently aged out of foster care.

Using data from the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth, a longitudinal study of youths aging out of foster care in 3 Midwestern states, and a bounds approach, we estimated the cumulative percentage of youths who become homeless during the transition to adulthood. We also estimated a discrete time hazard model that predicted first reported episode of homelessness. Youths aging out of foster care are at high risk for becoming homeless during the transition to adulthood. Between 31% and 46% of our study participants had been homeless at least once by age 26 years. Running away while in foster care, greater placement instability, being male, having a history of physical abuse, engaging in more delinquent behaviors, and having symptoms of a mental health disorder were associated with an increase in the relative risk of becoming homeless. Policy and practice changes are needed to reduce the risk that youths in foster care will become homeless after aging out.

This naturalistic, retrospective study describes an intervention (Transitional Supportive Housing and Case Management) that effectively promoted treatment admission for this high-risk group above and beyond that which could be explained by certain pretreatment factors. The clinical records of 211 military veterans referred to intensive outpatient addiction treatment were reviewed for factors related to treatment program admission, including 3 interventions designed to prevent waiting list attrition. Chi-square tests evaluated univariate predictors of treatment entry, and a hierarchical binary logistic regression evaluated several variables simultaneously. Results showed that fewer than 50% of wait-listed patients achieved treatment admission. Univariate predictors of treatment entry were not having a current partner, having a legal problem, and having had past substance use disorder treatment. The logistic regression showed that patients who received the intervention were 4.5 times more likely to enter the treatment program, and individuals with a current legal problem were 2.5 times more likely to enter treatment. Participation in a weekly support group and/or contact with a psychiatric nurse practitioner did not increase the likelihood of program admission. It may be possible to enhance treatment entry for the homeless and marginally housed by providing case management and housing services. Future research is needed to determine how the individual-level factors predicting treatment entry in this study can be used to tailor other interventions to further address the problem of waiting list attrition.

Chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems are disproportionately burdened with health-care problems and are high utilizers of emergency medical services (EMS). Single-site Housing First (HF), which provides immediate, permanent, low-barrier, nonabstinence-based, supportive housing, has been associated with reduced publicly funded service utilization. The aims of the current study were to determine whether time spent in single-site HF predicted decreases in EMS contacts 2 years subsequent to single-site HF move-in, and to describe medical conditions and injuries associated with EMS contacts in a sample of chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems. Methods. Participants were 91 chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems who were enrolled in a single-site HF program between December 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington. We obtained administrative data on exposure to HF and EMS utilization for the 2 years prior to and the 2 years subsequent to participants’ move-in date. EMS utilization variables included patient type (i.e., primary presenting problem), trauma/injury mechanism (i.e., EMS classification of the cause of the trauma or injury), level of care (i.e., basic life support, advanced life support), and transport destination. Results. After controlling for baseline EMS contacts, participants evinced 3% fewer EMS contacts for each additional month of single-site HF exposure. From the baseline to follow-up period, the mean number of EMS contacts declined from 15.85 (SD = 22.96) to 9.54 (SD = 15.08), representing a 54% reduction in the number of EMS contacts. Most calls were responded to by EMTs providing basic life support, and the majority resulted in transport to a local level I trauma center. The most common presenting difficulties were medical illness and trauma. Substance use and psychiatric difficulties were infrequently documented as the primary problem. Conclusions. Our findings support recent assertions that housing is health care and indicate that the amount of time spent in single-site HF is associated with significant reductions in EMS utilization for at least 2 years subsequent to move-in. These findings also underscore the high levels of medical illness and trauma exposure among chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems.\\n                                                                                                                                                                     Housing First Is Associated With Reduced Use Of Emergency Medical Services            2014.0\n",

The impact of school mobility increases their risk of academic failure (Evans, 1996; Ingersoll, Scamman, & Eckerling, 1989; Mao, 1997, Mehana & Reynolds, 2003; Reynolds & Wolf, 1999). Laws enforcing the right of students to remain in their \"original school of enrollment,\" help increase academic achievement. Two of these laws are the McKinney-Vento Act, a federal law protecting the rights of homeless youth (United States Department of Education, 2004), and AB490, a state law that supports the education of foster youth (Shea, Weinberg, & Zetlin, 2004). Both laws allow students to remain at their original school of enrollment so that they do not have to change schools even if their housing situation changes. Although these laws are in place, homeless and foster youth still tend to change schools more often than their housed peers. This study analyzes indicators of academic achievement including grade point averages, California Standard Test scores, attendance rates, credits earned, and suspensions for seventh through twelfth grade homeless, foster youth, and a non-mobile comparison group in the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Address moves and school moves were also analyzed for their impact on academic achievement. The statistical procedures used in this study include correlation coefficients, a canonical correlation, four 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVAs, and a series of 11 one-way ANOVAs to analyze whether school mobility variables have a statistically significant impact on the academic achievement variables for homeless and foster youth when compared to a third group of non-mobile, or housed students. Almost all procedures yielded statistical differences between the non-mobile comparison group and homeless and foster youth, although there were very few differences found between the homeless and foster students in this study.

Hawaii has lead the nation in MA use for many years, yet prior to 2007, did not have a comprehensive plan to care for pregnant substance-using women. In 2006, the Hawaii State Legislature funded a pilot perinatal addiction clinic. The Perinatal Addiction Treatment Clinic of Hawaii was built on a harm-reduction model, encompassing perinatal care, transportation, child-care, social services, family planning, motivational incentives, and addiction medicine. We present the implementation model and results from our first one hundred three infants (103) seen over 3 years of operation of the program. Referrals came from community health centers, hospitals, addiction treatment facilities, private physician offices, homeless outreach services and self-referral through word-of-mouth and bus ads. Data to describe sample characteristics and outcome was obtained prospectively and retrospectively from chart abstraction and delivery data. Drug use data was obtained from the women's self-report and random urine toxicology during the pregnancy, as well as urine toxicology at the time of birth on mothers, and urine and meconium toxicology on the infants. Post-partum depression was measured in mothers with the Edinburgh Post-Partum depression scale. Data from Path clinic patients were compared with a representative cohort of women delivering at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children during the same time frame, who were enrolled in another study of pregnancy outcomes. Ethical approval for this study was obtained through the University of Hawaii Committee for Human Studies. Between April 2007 and August 2010, 213 women with a past or present history of addiction were seen, 132 were pregnant and 97 delivered during that time. 103 live-born infants were delivered. There were 3 first-trimester Spontaneous Abortions, two 28-week intrauterine fetal deaths, and two sets of twins and 4 repeat pregnancies. Over 50% of the women had lost custody of previous children due to substance use. The majority of women who delivered used methamphetamine (86%), either in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy. Other drugs include marijuana (59.8%), cocaine (33%), opiates (9.6%), and alcohol (15.2%). Of the women served, 85% smoked cigarettes upon enrollment. Of the 97 women delivered during this period, all but 4 (96%) had negative urine toxicology at the time of delivery. Of the 103 infants, 13 (12.6%) were born preterm, equal to the state and national average, despite having many risk factors for prematurity, including poverty, poor diet, smoking and polysubstance use. Overwhelmingly, the women are parenting their children, > 90% retained custody at 8 weeks. Long-term follow-up showed that women who maintained custody chose long-acting contraceptive methods; while those who lost custody had a very high (> 50%) repeat pregnancy rate at 9 months post delivery. Methamphetamine use during pregnancy doesn't exist is isolation. It is often combined with a multitude of other adverse circumstances, including poverty, interpersonal violence, psychiatric comorbidity, polysubstance use, nutritional deficiencies, inadequate health care and stressful life experiences. A comprehensive harm reduction model of perinatal care, which aims to ameliorate some of these difficulties for substance-using women without mandating abstinence, provides exceptional birth outcomes and can be implemented with limited resources.

Quantitative findings suggested that forensic programs were less likely to follow a harm reduction approach to substance use and clients in those programs were more likely to live in congregate settings. Qualitative findings suggested that an interplay of court involvement, limited resources, and risk environments influenced staff decisions regarding housing and treatment. Existing mental health and criminal justice collaborations necessitate adaptation to the Housing First model to accommodate client needs.

Reflective practice, supervision and evaluation are then essential tools in developing a \"learning organisation\", where the collective dynamics at an organisational level support the psychological work of the PIE.\\nResearch limitations/implications\\n- The implications for homelessness work that can be drawn from the outcome of this project is to better understand how the PIE linked to the concept of a learning organisation can provide a truly robust framework for providing a service that can evolve harmoniously, tying in disparate funding streams to offer very challenging young people an outstanding service that addresses their homelessness and its underlying causes.\\nPractical implications\\n- The practical implications shown are the psychological skills that can be developed in housing workers; the limits of those skills and how they are complemented by partnership work with other voluntary sector organisations and mainstream health providers; how the ideas of the learning organisation can naturally underpin the work of the PIE.\\nOriginality/value\\n- The combination of the concept of the learning organisation, reflective practice and the PIE provides a highly original and truly robust framework for providing housing workers with the psychological tools to make a transformative difference in the lives of especially vulnerable young homeless people.

Data came from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of child welfare-involved families. Child protective services caseworkers as well as caregivers provided information on families whose child remained in the home after initial investigation ( N  = 3,867). Multilevel latent class analyses tested the presence of inadequately housed subgroups using 4 housing problem indicators at baseline. Logistic regressions assessed convergent and predictive validity. A two class latent solution best fit the data. Findings indicated that inadequate housing contributed to risk for out-of-home placement in approximately 16 % of intact families under investigation by child protective services. These families were 4 times more likely to need housing services 12 months later. Federal legislation emphasizes integration of social services as necessary to end homelessness. This study demonstrates overlap across public agencies. Enhanced coordination of child welfare and housing services facilitates interventions to prevent and mitigate homelessness.

These are informed by the key learnings from our ongoing youth engagement research. Those insights emphasize the importance of meaningful engagement of youth through building a positive relationship with youth from a strengths-based perspective to mobilize youth’s talents into our collaborative engagement efforts in order to effectively support “high-risk” youth and aspire their educational pathways. Conceptually, our work aligns with the paradigms of positive youth development (PYD) and social justice youth development (SJYD). Practically, our research project represents an “anti-oppressive practice” in itself because the project engages youth as important contributors to a social/system change, especially, the role of our youth leaders in our team as a conduit for mobilizing youth views and actions on social justice issues (e.g., oppression, marginalization, social exclusion/inclusion, human rights, empowerment).

They are vulnerable to many risks, whether or not they remain connected to families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities. Objectives Primary research objectives To evaluate and summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street‐connected children and young people that aim to: • promote inclusion and reintegration; • increase literacy and numeracy; • facilitate access to education and employment; • promote mental health, including self esteem; • reduce harms associated with early sexual activity and substance misuse. Secondary research objectives • To explore whether effects of interventions differ within and between populations, and whether an equity gradient influences these effects, by extrapolating from all findings relevance for low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) (Peters 2004). • To describe other health, educational, psychosocial and behavioural effects, when appropriate outcomes are reported. • To explore the influence of context in design, delivery and outcomes of interventions. • To explore the relationship between numbers of components and duration and effects of interventions. • To highlight implications of these findings for further research and research methods to improve evidence in relation to the primary research objective. • To consider adverse or unintended outcomes. Search methods We searched the following bibliographic databases, searched for the original review, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non‐governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and Pre‐MEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Sociological s; Social Services s; Social Work s; Healthstar; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Libraries; British Library for Development Studies (BLDS); Google and Google Scholar. We updated the search in April 2015 for the review update, using the same methods. Selection criteria This review includes data from harm reduction or reintegration intervention studies that used a comparison group study design; all were randomised or quasi‐randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions provided for street‐connected children and young people, from birth to 24 years, in all contexts. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and other factors presented in the Discussion and Summary quality assessment (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). We extracted data on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes, and grouped outcomes into psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. We conducted meta‐analyses for outcomes where the outcome measures were sufficiently similar. We evaluated other outcomes narratively. Main results We included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high‐income countries (HICs). At update stage (from our 2015 search), one previously included study was removed and three new studies added (since our 2012 search). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop‐in and shelter‐based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects.We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours . Interventions evaluated consisted of time‐limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop‐in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Analysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop‐in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street‐connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street‐connected children and young people with different backgrounds and service needs.

Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children—99 ages 1.5–5 years, 113 ages 6–10 years, and 99 ages 11–16 years—included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11–16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6–10 and 11–16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

This study examines the association between high-risk sexual behavior and structural determinants of sexual health among a sample of young African American women. 237 young African American women (16–19 years old) from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in North Carolina were enrolled into a randomized trial testing the efficacy of an adapted HIV/STI prevention intervention. Logistic regression analyses predicted the likelihood that young women reporting lack of food at home, homelessness and low future prospects would also report sexual risk behaviors. Young women reporting a lack of food at home (22 %), homelessness (27 %), and low perceived education/employment prospects (19 %) had between 2.2 and 4.7 times the odds as those not reporting these risk factors of reporting multiple sex partners, risky sex partners including older men and partners involved in gangs, substance use prior to sex, and exchange sex. Self-reported structural determinants of sexual health were associated with myriad sexual risk behaviors. Diminished economic conditions among these young women may lead to sexual risk due to hopelessness, the need for survival or other factors.

However, less is known of the mental health status of these homeless youth and its role in risky sexual behaviours; neither do we understand the reasons homeless youth give for their engagement in various health risk behaviour. Objective: The main purpose of this study was in three fold: (1) to explore the reasons for homeless youth engagement in health risk behaviours; (2) to determine the relationship between substance use and sexual risks behaviours and (3) to determine the factors related to their psychological functioning. Method: An exploratory sequential mixed methods design was used to collect data from 227 homeless youth recruited from Accra, Ghana. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the transcripts of 16 homeless youth who revealed their experiences of how they live their life on the street. Results: Of the 227 participants in the study, 199 (87.6 %) exhibited moderate to severe psychological problems. Violent behaviour, suicidal ideation and stigma (both self and social stigma) significantly predicted overall psychological functioning. Substance use among street youth particularly alcohol use, marijuana and cigarette smoking were independently associated with having unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners and engagement in survival sex. Engagements in risky behaviours were primary focused on survival strategies, and the emotional impact of homelessness was evidenced in their feelings of exclusion due to social stigma and feelings of despondency and depression. Conclusion: The findings in this study calls for a more holistic interventions to help improve the health and wellbeing of street-connected youth. Such interventions should address concurrent substance use and sexual risk behaviours, and improved access to psychological health services.

Using a systems theory framework, the authors answer the question of whether homeless students in grade 6 from LEAs that received MCKV funding scored better in reading comprehension and mathematics on end-of-grade (EOG) test scores than did those from LEAs that did not receive MCKV funding. Data from 2006 and 2007 were provided by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. About 20 percent of the state's LEAs received MCKV grants, which created a treatment group (funded LEAs) and a control group (nonfunded LEAs). Using untreated control group designs with matched pretests (grade 5 EOG test scores) and posttests (grade 6 EOG test scores), 2 × 2 analyses of variance with repeated measures failed to reject the null hypotheses. The authors did not support the hypotheses that MCKV grants improved the academic achievement of homeless students. There was no significant difference in the funded and nonfunded EOG test scores.

the effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) among marginalized, opioid-dependent individuals in terms of retention in and cycling into and out of a harm-reduction program. This pilot study enrolled 100 participants and followed them from November 2005 to July 2008. The overall proportion of patients retained in the program at the end of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months was 68%, 63%, 56%, and 42%, respectively. This pilot study demonstrated that BUP/NX could be successfully used to treat marginalized heroin users.

We used data from 4 waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, involving a sample of 2631 low-income children in 20 large US cities who have been followed since birth. Multivariate analyses involved logistic regression using the hybrid method to include both fixed and random effects. Of the sample, 9.8% experienced homelessness and an additional 23.6% had a doubled-up episode. Housing status had little significant adverse effect on child physical or mental health, cognitive development, or health care use. Family and environmental stressors common to many children in poverty, rather than just homeless and doubled-up episodes, were associated with young children's poor health and cognitive development and high health care use. Practitioners need to identify and respond to parental and family needs for support services in addition to housing assistance to effectively improve the health and development of young children who experience residential instability, particularly those in homeless families.

This study was undertaken to estimate the probability of reaching residential stability over time and to identify predictors of residential stability among homeless young adults aged 18 to 25 years. A prospective cohort study was carried out in Montréal, Canada, between April 5(th) 2006 and January 21(th) 2009. Interviews conducted every three months included questions on life conditions and social and mental health factors that are known to influence residential trajectories. Residential status was determined, starting on the first day after recruitment; each follow-up day was classified as a homeless day or a housed day. A period of 90 days was used to define residential stability; therefore the main study outcome was the occurrence of the first consecutive 90 housed days during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were conducted. Of the 359 participants, 284 reached 90 days of residential stability over the study period, representing an annual probability of 80.5 %. In multivariate analysis, youth who had a high school degree, had a formal sector activity, and those who had sought psychological help were more likely to reach residential stability. Being a man, injecting substances, and having an informal sector activity were associated with a decreased probability to reach residential stability. Exposure to factors related to opportunities that promote social integration increases the chance of reaching residential stability. On the other hand, factors related to high level of street entrenchment seem to interfere with stabilization. Maximum efforts should be made to prevent chronic homelessness among youth, targeting not only individual impairments but also hinging on services adapted to foster social connections among the youth.

A transgender-specific HIV Prevention Case Management (PCM) intervention was implemented in a community HIV prevention setting and targeted reducing sex work and homelessness, increasing legal employment and income, and reducing psychological and emotional distress symptoms. Sixty high-risk transgender women were enrolled in the ten-session PCM intervention. Participants completed approximately nine out of the ten sessions (M = 8.7; SD = 2.6) and six-month follow-up evaluations were completed with 97% of the participants. Findings from baseline to follow-up evaluations demonstrated a decrease in homelessness (31.0% vs. 10.3%, p<0.01), less reliance on exchange sex as a primary source of income (41.4% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.05), and significant decreases in symptom complaints across multiple Brief Symptom Inventory sub-scales, including depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism (all significant at p<0.05). Further, socioeconomic improvements following the intervention were significantly associated with psychological and emotional gains. The study suggests that adding a culturally appropriate PCM intervention in a community setting is beneficial in addressing co-factors for HIV infection as well as psychological and emotional distress symptoms among this extremely high-risk population.

Strengths and noteworthy findings as well as the challenges and limitations of this literature are summarized. The studies reviewed in this chapter represent laudable efforts on the part of researchers, practitioners, and community partners to engage in intervention studies with the challenging and understudied population of children in families experiencing homelessness. However, within the guidelines of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards for evidence-based practices, none of the interventions represented in these studies have sufficient evidence to be rated as having Positive Effects. Most often, this is due to lack of quality evidence that evaluates the program outcomes. Policymakers, funding agencies, researchers, clinicians, and community practitioners can expand the evidence base for interventions with homeless children through understanding what constitutes quality evaluations and supporting high-quality research. This chapter concludes with recommendations for building a robust and rigorous evidence base of what works to allow stakeholders to improve the well-being of at-risk children, bettering their lives through increasingly effective and efficient programs.

This study assessed the psychosocial and health status of 454 formerly homeless children living with their families in 17 supportive housing communities. Findings indicated that children had good access to physical health care. However, children faced significant psychosocial risks and manifested behavioral, emotional, and school challenges. Housing agencies lacked infrastructure or expertise in children's mental health. The authors propose that supportive housing provides a valuable but hitherto underused opportunity to support children's psychosocial functioning.

Using an ecological resilience prediction model (ERPM) based on the literature on resilience in at-risk youth, the study followed 82 youth who were initially homeless for a 2-year period, to identify predictors of participating in school. Female sex and increased duration of rehousing at Time 2 significantly predicted being in school at follow-up. Youth who were not in school reported a greater increase in satisfaction with social support compared to youth who were participating in school at follow-up. The study adds to what is understood regarding the longitudinal consequences of housing instability and discontinuity in school participation in youth by examining ecological predictors of resilience.

The programs may be the first of their kind in the homeless literature in which both adults and children were exposed to career, academic, and leadership opportunities in the supportive learning environment of a university campus, and where academy children's academic and self-perception results were compared with matched controls. Children experienced literacy instruction, a mathematics board game, robotics, leadership training, tennis instruction on court facilities, and computer, biology, and chemistry at respective laboratory sites. Adults participated in writing workshop, computer, health and self-care, urban economic, counseling, career, and yoga sessions. Academy children did not experience gains in norm-referenced vocabulary, spelling, or behavioural tests, but did demonstrate highly significant gains in writing ability based on state rubric criteria when compared with controls. In addition, they significantly increased in vocabulary understanding based on eight books read and in tennis skills.

Using data drawn from two national surveys and follow-on qualitative studies, the authors trace urban myths of rurality and their effects on runaway provision. The authors review models of rural refuge, systemic advocacy and mobile services for rural runaways. Evidence suggests that both young runaways’ services and young runaways themselves are particularly at risk of stigmatisation in the rural context. The authors suggest that in this context of high visibility in a rural area, add-on services to generic provision may offer a solution.

At the time of the survey, approximately 60% of the sample was in the voluntary care of the state agency. Quantitative data describe the services received and outcomes achieved. Qualitative comments provide further feedback about young people's perceptions of services. Many statutory and private child-serving agencies continue efforts to develop services to meet the needs of this population. Study findings have implications for further development of these services to assist youth at the time of transition.

These problems become even more apparent when homelessness and educational attainment intersect. The McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 was enacted to address these concerns. While some schools attempt to implement the law to benefit homeless youth, clear limitations in service delivery remain. This article explores the perspectives of homeless youth who were trying to remain in high school. From a social justice framework using qualitative analyses, three focus groups were conducted at a transitional living program in a large urban area. Focus group transcripts were coded to capture key themes identified by youth. These include knowledge of McKinney–Vento rights, self-disclosure of homelessness, the negative effects of homelessness, and factors that protect youth from dropping out.

In this study, group differences were assessed using qualitative data from 27 HF and 48 TF clients. Dichotomous variables for substance use and substance abuse treatment utilization were created and examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. The HF group had significantly lower rates of substance use and substance abuse treatment utilization; they were also significantly less likely to leave their program. Housing First’s positive impact is contrasted with the difficulties Treatment First programs have in retaining clients and helping them avoid substance use and possible relapse.

Homeless youth face increased obstacles in making the transition to adulthood in that they may lack basic life skills to be independent and self-sufficient. Independent living programs provide semi-supervised living arrangements where participants are required to be in the process of being enrolled in work or school, engage in life skills training and comply with the program's rules.

One hundred and thirty-three youth (42 boys and young men; 91 girls and young women) from six community agencies completed questionnaires created to assess youth ratings of program dimensions associated with positive development. Relationships were examined among dimension ratings, client characteristics and overall satisfaction. Regression analyses revealed significant main effects for participant age, appropriate structure, empowerment, and positive social norms, and two age by dimension interactions. Older youth who were more satisfied with agency programming produced higher ratings for agency structure, while for younger youth, satisfaction was positively associated with ratings for agency safety. Implications for service delivery and policy are discussed.

Both in developed and developing countries there is a large proportion of people who do not know they are infected with HIV. Knowledge of one's own HIV serostatus is necessary to access HIV support, care and treatment and to prevent acquisition or further transmission of HIV. Using telephones instead of face-to-face or other means of HIV test results delivery could lead to more people receiving their HIV test results. To assess the effectiveness of telephone use for delivery of HIV test results and post-test counselling.To evaluate the effectiveness of delivering HIV test results by telephone, we were interested in whether they can increase the proportion of people who receive their HIV test results and the number of people knowing their HIV status. We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), WHOs The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We also searched grey literature sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International,CAB Direct Global Health, OpenSIGLE, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and AEGIS Education Global Information System, and reference lists of relevant studies for this review. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (qRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone HIV test results notification and post-test counselling to face-to-face or other ways of HIV test result delivery in people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. Out of 14 717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria; an RCT conducted on homeless and high-risk youth between September 1998 and October 1999 in Portland, United States. Participants (n=351) were offered counselling and oral HIV testing and were randomised into face-to-face (n=187 participants) and telephone (n=167) notification groups. The telephone notification group had the option of receiving HIV test results either by telephone or face-to-face. Overall, only 48% (n=168) of participants received their HIV test results and post-test counselling. Significantly more participants received their HIV test results in the telephone notification group compared to the face-to-face notification group; 58% (n=106) vs. 37% (n=62) (p < 0.001). In the telephone notification group, the majority of participants who received their HIV test results did so by telephone (88%, n=93). The study could not offer information about the effectiveness of telephone HIV test notification with HIV-positive participants because only two youth tested positive and both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group. The study had a high risk of bias. We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients' and providers', its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects.

It has a sufficient knowledge base and interest to warrant a test of wide-scale implementation in various settings. This protocol describes the quantitative design of a Canadian five city, $110 million demonstration project and provides the rationale for key scientific decisions. Methods A pragmatic, mixed methods, multi-site field trial of the effectiveness of Housing First in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, is randomising approximately 2500 participants, stratified by high and moderate need levels, into intervention and treatment as usual groups. Quantitative outcome measures are being collected over a 2-year period and a qualitative process evaluation is being completed. Primary outcomes are housing stability, social functioning and, for the economic analyses, quality of life. Hierarchical linear modelling is the primary data analytic strategy. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics board approval has been obtained from 11 institutions and a safety and adverse events committee is in place. The results of the multi-site analyses of outcomes at 12 months and 2 years will be reported in a series of core scientific journal papers.

Despite being significant users of hospital emergency department (ED) services for acute and ongoing health needs, little is known about their experiences of ED care and the factors affecting their ED use. This study used a grounded theory and community-based approach to examine these issues. Focus groups and individual interviews were facilitated with 48 SI youth between ages 15 and 26 years, recruited in hospital or through community agencies serving SI youth in a major Western Canadian city. Results demonstrate that SI youth often perceived suboptimal care and experienced long waiting periods that led to many avoiding or prematurely exiting the ED. Service gaps appeared to have a negative bearing on their care and health outcomes. Findings invite a critical review of ED care processes, structures, and staff interactions in the aim of enhancing ED services to SI youth.

suggest this number could be even higher2-and more than 5000 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alone.3 Life stories like Brandon's were at the heart of journey2home-a yearlong, socially engaged public art project focused on youth housing insecurity. A project of the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, journey2home used photography, painting, printmaking, poetry, performance, music, and documentary film to encourage intergenerational dialogue about youth housing insecurity, which is both devastating and common.

Forty-seven mothers were randomized to MTP versus the Parent Education Program (PE), a comparison intervention providing individual case management and child guidance brochures. At post-treatment, MTP mothers demonstrated better reflective functioning in the Parent Development Interview, representational coherence and sensitivity, and caregiving behavior than PE mothers. Partial support was also found for proposed mechanisms of change in the MTP model. Together, preliminary findings suggest that attachment-based interventions may be more effective than traditional parent training for enhancing relationships between substance using women and their young children.

It focuses on housing, finances, employment and access to support services. After fifteen/eighteen months, 69 per cent of the young people were still in their original accommodation, 13 per cent had moved to another tenancy and 18 per cent no longer had a tenancy. Most were glad to have been resettled but found the transition very challenging, particularly with regard to managing finances and finding stable employment. The prevalence of debts increased substantially over time, and those who moved to private-rented accommodation had the poorest outcomes. People who had been in temporary accommodation more than twelve months prior to resettlement were more likely to retain a tenancy, while a history of illegal drug use and recent rough sleeping were associated negatively with tenancy sustainment.

This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths.Methods:At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics.Results:More youths than adults had not finished high school (76% versus 54%), had a drug use disorder (66% versus 52%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44% versus 36%) (all p<.05). Fewer than half the youths (49%) had a regular medical doctor, 50% reported unmet need for health care, and 61% visited an emergency department in the past six months.Conclusions:This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.

The study was designed to learn about the barriers and supports experienced by homeless women in the North when accessing mental health care, shelter, housing and other services; and to inform the work of northern service providers and policy advocates in a position to implement adjustments in their praxis. This article describes the trajectories of women's service access and their ideas for service improvement from 61 qualitative, semi-structured interviews conducted with homeless women in Whitehorse, Yukon (YT), Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (NT), and Iqualit, Nunavut (NU). Unresolved trauma, poverty and social exclusion, inability to find and maintain housing and ineffective services emerged as interconnected and multifaceted challenges related to women's service engagement. In the face of these challenges, women displayed significant resilience and resistance, and offered important ideas for service improvement. The 4 interconnected systemic challenges identified in the research, coupled with specific ideas for change cited by the resilient homeless women interviewed, offer points of entry to improve service policy and delivery. Implementing trauma-informed approaches emerged as a key example of how access to, and quality of, services could be improved for homeless women in the North.

This article reports on two open trials using TIR with 33 urban at-risk youth and 31 unaccompanied refugee minors. In both studies, participants consistently responded positively. In the second study, nearly all participants who began treatment with posttraumatic stress disorder ended without it, with an average of at least one significant trauma memory being treated per session.

Based on the goals of this comprehensive prevention program, we predicted that intervention participants receiving ER services would show improvement in parenting and child outcomes relative to families in treatment-as-usual sites. The sample included 270 children in 161 families, residing in 15 supportive housing sites; multimethod, multi-informant assessments conducted at baseline and yearly thereafter included parent and teacher report of child adjustment, parent report of parenting self-efficacy, and parent-child observations that yielded scores of effective parenting practices. Data were modeled in HLM7 (4-level model accounting for nesting of children within families and families within housing sites). Two years' postbaseline, intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses indicated that parents in the ER group showed significantly improved parenting self-efficacy, and parent report indicated significant reductions in ER group children's depression. No main effects of ITT were shown for observed parenting effectiveness. However, over time, average levels of parenting self-efficacy predicted observed effective parenting practices, and observed effective parenting practices predicted improvements in both teacher- and parent-report of child adjustment. This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate prevention effects of a program for homeless families residing in family supportive housing.

The attitudes and behaviors of shelter workers and management toward LGBTQ2S youth were also explored. A critical action research approach, informed by critical ethnography and institutional ethnography was employed. Thirty-three people participated in this study in the Greater Toronto Area. The study triangulated data from interviews, focus groups, observations, and document analysis. The systemic enactment of homophobia, transphobia, and hegemonic masculinity are often normalized in shelters and create significant barriers to safe, accessible, and supportive services for LGBTQ2S youth. Excessive bureaucratic regulation and the lack of necessary bureaucratic regulation in highly significant areas play a key role in creating the disjunctures that occur for LGBTQ2S youth in shelters.

Homeless people are importantly hindered and/or steered in their health care use by barriers directly related to the organisation of care. Our goal is to describe the accessibility of primary health care services, secondary care and emergency care for homeless people living in an area with a universal primary health care system and active guidance towards this unique system. Observational, cross-sectional study design. Data from the Belgian National health survey were merged with comparable data collected by means of a face-to-face interview from homeless people in Ghent. 122 homeless people who made use of homeless centres and shelters in Ghent were interviewed using a reduced version of the Belgian National Health survey over a period of 5 months. 2-dimensional crosstabs were built in order to study the bivariate relationship between health care use (primary health care, secondary and emergency care) and being homeless. To determine the independent association, a logistic model was constructed adjusting for age and sex. Homeless people have a higher likelihood to consult a GP than the non-homeless people in Ghent, even after adjusting for age and sex. The same trend is demonstrated for secondary and emergency care. Homeless people in Ghent do find the way to primary health care and make use of it. It seems that the universal primary health care system in Ghent with an active guidance by social workers contributes to easier GP access.

The study combined quantitative tracking of youths' response patterns and open-ended interviews regarding youths' preferred methods of communication. Results indicate that maintaining communication with homeless youth requires persistence, including frequent contact attempts over several days. Cell phone contacts (calls or texts) were most successful in communicating with youth, with e-mail and Facebook messaging useful when phones were lost or stolen. Youth who maintained contact were strikingly similar to youth who discontinued contact.

However, youth transitioning into adulthood have not received similar attention. These older youth have frequently been overlooked by policymakers and practitioners who have been more focused on designing programs and services for adolescents and young children. Because older youth face a unique set of challenges and risks as they move into adulthood, it is important to identify intervention strategies that can enhance the development and success of these individuals in domains such as employment, independent living, drug and alcohol use, pregnancy, parenting, life skills, mental health, release from the foster care system, homelessness, violence, education, and literacy. This synthesis examines the role that programs designed to serve older youth can play in promoting positive development and subsequent self-sufficiency in adulthood. The authors synthesize the findings from 31 studies that implemented random assignment intent-to-treat experimental evaluations to examine the impacts of various intervention strategies on youth well-being outcomes during the transition to adulthood (ages 18 to 25). While all programs evaluated outcomes for these \"emerging adults,\" programs varied in the ages of targeted youth: 10 programs targeted youth from as early as 12 years and into their early twenties; eight programs served youth from 16 years and into their early twenties; and 11 programs began at 18 years of age. This review of experimental evaluations indicates that education and career programs can be effective, especially for low income youth and for youth targeted from younger ages, for example, those under age 18. Furthermore, specific intervention strategies, such as mentoring, case management, and providing child care for young parents, are associated with program success across outcomes.

The National Center on Family Homelessness reports that more than 1.6 million children - or one in 45 children - were homeless annually in America between 2006 and 2010. It is estimated that 40 percent of homeless children, or roughly 640,000 over that timeframe, were under the age of six. 12 This brief highlights the effects of homelessness on children, with a particular emphasis on young children, and notes several policies and practices that could help mitigate negative outcomes.

Although services are mandated for this population under the McKinney-Vento Act, Education of Homeless Children and Youth Program, and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, barriers continue to exist for young children related to identification and access to quality early intervention services and supports. These barriers, as well as a collaborative approach to the identification and delivery of early intervention services, are discussed.

There were 9,389 homeless students in 2006 compared with 12,227 in 2001. Three groups were over-represented in the homeless population: Indigenous students, young people from single parent and blended families, and teenagers who had been in state care and protection. The number of homeless young people aged 12 to 18 decreased from 26,060 in 2001 to 21,940 in 2006. An increase in early intervention services appears to account for most of the decrease in youth homelessness.

Following the workshop, focus group discussions were held with 80 youth from four youth-serving agencies. Youth expressed increased levels of confidence and empowerment, consistent with recent criticism that a focus on specific behaviors as intervention outcome measures may miss important psychosocial changes in participants. Some youth views on cultural adaptation of workshops were not consistent with current views expressed by some adult educators, highlighting the need to ensure a youth perspective is captured during intervention development. Finally, the dichotomous views that youth expressed regarding workshop activities emphasizes a research gap related to how best to adapt interventions to different cognitive capacities, literacy levels, and learning styles. Information of this kind is relevant in terms of knowledge translation from youth to program planners and educators.

Research suggests that linking health care to H/UH adolescents might help improve their continuity of care, with most preferring to access health care information via the Internet. YTH StreetConnect is a dual-purpose mobile app that helps H/UH youth access health and vital services in Santa Clara County, CA, USA. We developed YTH StreetConnect PRO in parallel with the youth app as a companion tablet app for providers who serve H/UH youth. The objective of our study was to develop a mobile app to support H/UH youth and their providers in accessing health and vital resources, and to conduct usability and feasibility testing of the app among H/UH youth and technical consultants with local expertise in serving H/UH youth. Formative research included a literature review on H/UH youths' mobile phone and Internet usage. In January 2015, we conducted interviews with medical and service providers of H/UH youth. Usability and feasibility testing were done with target audiences. Additionally, we conducted focus groups with youth regarding the app's youth friendliness, accessibility, and usefulness. H/UH youth and their providers noted the app's functionality, youth friendliness, and resources. Usability testing proposed improvements to the app, including visual updates to the user interface, map icons, new underrepresented resource categories, and the addition of a peer rating system. Limitations included a small sample size among H/UH youth and providers and a single site for the study (Santa Clara County, CA), making the findings ungeneralizable to the US population. YTH StreetConnect is a promising way to increase service utilization, provide referral access, and share resources among H/UH youth and providers. Input from H/UH youth and providers offers insights on how to improve future models of YTH StreetConnect and similar programs that assist H/UH youth.

    "    You are an expert reviewer for research studies with human-like reasoning. Your goal is to identify empirical studies about youth homelessness interventions that should be considered for inclusion. Based on the study details below, the tnterpretation guidance, and the eligibility criteria, decide if the study should be included. Use contextual inference to reduce false negatives (e.g., lean toward 'Yes' when ambiguous but not definitively 'No'). \n",

    "\n",
    "    Interpretation Guidance:\n",
    "    - If a study uses terms like \"youth,\" \"adolescents,\" or \"young people,\" assume the target age is 13–25 unless contradicted.\n",
    "    - Use 'Publication Year' from the study details as the definitive publication date, ignoring earlier years mentioned in the abstract (e.g., data collection years).\n",
    "    - If a country isn’t mentioned, assume OECD unless evidence suggests otherwise.\n",
    "    - If a program/intervention is described with outcomes (e.g., reduced substance use, test scores), assume effectiveness is reported.\n",
    "    - If the study discusses how the intervention was applied, implemented, or delivered, assume it reports on implementation. To further explain, if the study describes assignment to interventions, group comparisons (e.g., treatment vs. control), or engagement/process details, assume implementation is reported.\n",

    "    Eligibility Criteria:\n",
    "    1. Original or Empirical Research: The study is based on observation and measurement of phenomena using primary data. Secondary data may form the theoretical background. Editorials, letters, and protocols are not included.\n",
    "    2. Publication Date: Published in 2008 or later.\n",
    "    3. Target Population (Age): Focuses on youth aged 13–25 (infer from relevant words such as \"youth,\" \"adolescents,\" \"young people\", etc.).\n",
    "    4. Target Population (Homelessness): Focuses on youth who are homeless, unstably housed, or at risk of homelessness, including those who: a) are unstably housed, b) have run away from home, c) are currently homeless, or d) are at risk of homelessness (infer from related terms like 'runaway' or 'housing instability').\n",
    "    5. Geographical Scope: Conducted in an OECD country. OECD countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States (infer from country names, author affiliation, or journal if not explicit. If  If a country is not mentioned, assume it is in the OECD.).\n",
    "    6. Study Focus: Describes a program, service, or intervention related to youth homelessness (infer from context if not explicit).\n",
    "    7. Effectiveness Reporting: Reports effectiveness of the program, service, or intervention (infer from outcomes or results if 'effectiveness' isn’t explicit).\n",
    "    8. Implementation Reporting: Reports implementation of the program, service, or intervention (infer from process descriptions, such as assignment, group design, or process details, if 'implementation' isn’t explicit).\n",
