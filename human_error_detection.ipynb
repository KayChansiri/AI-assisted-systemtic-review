      "6    Background Millions of street‐connected children and young people worldwide live or work in street environments. They are vulnerable to many risks, whether or not they remain connected to families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities. Objectives Primary research objectives To evaluate and summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street‐connected children and young people that aim to: • promote inclusion and reintegration; • increase literacy and numeracy; • facilitate access to education and employment; • promote mental health, including self esteem; • reduce harms associated with early sexual activity and substance misuse. Secondary research objectives • To explore whether effects of interventions differ within and between populations, and whether an equity gradient influences these effects, by extrapolating from all findings relevance for low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) (Peters 2004). • To describe other health, educational, psychosocial and behavioural effects, when appropriate outcomes are reported. • To explore the influence of context in design, delivery and outcomes of interventions. • To explore the relationship between numbers of components and duration and effects of interventions. • To highlight implications of these findings for further research and research methods to improve evidence in relation to the primary research objective. • To consider adverse or unintended outcomes. Search methods We searched the following bibliographic databases, searched for the original review, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non‐governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and Pre‐MEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Sociological s; Social Services s; Social Work s; Healthstar; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Libraries; British Library for Development Studies (BLDS); Google and Google Scholar. We updated the search in April 2015 for the review update, using the same methods. Selection criteria This review includes data from harm reduction or reintegration intervention studies that used a comparison group study design; all were randomised or quasi‐randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions provided for street‐connected children and young people, from birth to 24 years, in all contexts. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and other factors presented in the Discussion and Summary quality assessment (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). We extracted data on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes, and grouped outcomes into psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. We conducted meta‐analyses for outcomes where the outcome measures were sufficiently similar. We evaluated other outcomes narratively. Main results We included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high‐income countries (HICs). At update stage (from our 2015 search), one previously included study was removed and three new studies added (since our 2012 search). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop‐in and shelter‐based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects.We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours . Interventions evaluated consisted of time‐limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop‐in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Analysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop‐in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street‐connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street‐connected children and young people with different backgrounds and service needs.            1\n",

Methods Fourteen databases were searched to identify qualitative and quantitative researches that examined barriers and/or facilitators to mental health care among the six groups of potentially disadvantaged young people. Results Out of 62 studies identified, 3 were conducted with ATSI young people, 1 with CALD young people, 4 with LGBTQI young people, 14 with homeless young people, 24 with substance‐using young people, and 16 with young people residing in rural or remote areas. Findings generally confirmed barriers already established for all young people, but indicated that some may be heightened for young people in the six identified groups. Findings also pointed to both similarities and differences between these groups, suggesting that ATSI, CALD, LGBTQI, homeless, substance‐using, and rural young people have some similar needs with respect to not only mental health care, but also other needs likely to reflect their individual circumstances. Discussion This systematic review highlights that young people from potentially disadvantaged groups have distinct needs that must be recognized to improve their experiences with mental health care. Future research of good methodological quality with young people is needed to increase accessibility of, and engagement with, mental health care.            1\n",

The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic review of both the quantitative and qualitative research that explores outreach with street-involved youth. Using 16 outreach programs with quantitative information, our meta-analysis found that 63% of youth who are contacted through outreach later participate in the offered service. Our meta-synthesis of 31 qualitative articles on outreach uncovered 13 themes across 4 conceptual domains of interest. Themes pertaining to the therapeutic relationship, flexibility, and youth-centric programming had a large presence among the majority of the articles. Outreach with street-involved youth, when characterized through a strong bond between worker and youth, is an effective strategy for involving youth in agency services.            1\n",

Canadian children and adolescents are the most vulnerable because youth comprise the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. A systematic literature review was undertaken using MEDLINE, Web of Science and the Homeless Hub (www.homelesshub.ca) to encompass the time frame from January 1990 to June 2009. The following terms were used as key words: ‘homelessness’, ‘homeless youth’, ‘poverty’, ‘street youth’ and ‘runaway’. The present review identified an intersection among education deficits, social service insufficiencies, and poor mental and physical health in homeless youth. Health care delivery to homeless youth was often nonanticipatory, inconsistent and perceived as discriminatory. However, street youth were identified as requiring health care for pregnancy, mental health concerns, sexually transmitted illnesses, respiratory conditions, substance abuse and a myriad of other illnesses. Plenty of work is still required to reduce health inequalities and improve the daily living conditions of Canadian youth living in poverty.            1\n",

However, very little is known about which specific interventions achieve the best outcomes for children in these overlapping transitional living situations. To address this gap, we review existing literature to identify the most promising practices for children living in transition. A standardised vocabulary specific to each of three electronic databases (i.e. Medline, PsychINFO and CINAHL) was employed to identify studies that described an intervention specifically targeting foster care or homeless children and families. Separate systematic searches were conducted for homeless and foster children, and only studies published in English between January 1993 and February 2009 were selected. The final sample (n = 43) of articles described interventions that fell into two categories: mental health (n = 17) and case management (n = 26). No article included a sample containing both homeless and foster care children, and most studies on homeless children used case management interventions while most studies on foster care children focused on mental health interventions. Few articles employed rigorous study designs. Although repeatedly studies have demonstrated the overlap between populations of homeless and foster care children, studies focused on one population or the other. Virtually all studies on both homeless and foster children devised interventions to reduce trauma and family instability; yet, no evidence-based practice addresses the overlapping needs and potentially relevant evidence-based practice for these two populations. An important and vital next step is to establish an effective evidence-based intervention that reduces the impact of trauma on both U.S. populations of children living in transition.\\n            1\n",

Interventions for homeless youth are challenging. Assessment of the effectiveness of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviours for preventing HIV in homeless youth is needed. Objectives To evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of interventions for modifying sexual risk behaviours and preventing transmission of HIV among homeless youth. Search methods We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSearch, Gateway, PsycInfo, LILACS), reference lists of eligible articles, international health agency publication lists, and clinical trial registries. The search was updated January 2010. We contacted authors of published reports and other key role players. Selection criteria Randomised studies of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour (biological, self‐reporting of sexual‐risk behaviour or health‐seeking behaviour) in homeless youth (12‐24 years). Data collection and analysis Data from eligible studies were extracted by two reviewers. We assessed risk of bias per the Cochrane Collaborations tool. None of the eligible studies reported any primary biological outcomes for this review. Reports of self‐reporting sexual risk behaviour outcomes varied across studies precluding calculation of summary measures of effect; we present the outcomes descriptively for each study. We contacted authors for missing or ambiguous data. Main results We identified three eligible studies after screening a total of 255 unique records. All three were performed in the United States of America and recruited substance‐abusing male and female adolescents (total N=615) through homeless shelters into randomised controlled trials of independent and non‐overlapping behavioural interventions. The three trials differed in theoretical background, delivery method, dosage (number of sessions,) content and outcome assessments. Overall, the variability in delivery and outcomes precluded estimation of summary of effect measures. We assessed the risk of bias to be high for each of the studies. Whilst some effect of the interventions on outcome measures were reported, heterogeneity and lack of robustness in these studies necessitate caution in interpreting the effectiveness of these interventions.  Authors' conclusions The body of evidence does not permit conclusions on the impact of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour in homeless youth; more research is required. While the psychosocial and contextual factors that fuel sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth challenge stringent methodologies of RCT's, novel ways for program delivery and trial retention are in need of development. Future trials should comply with rigorous methodology in design, delivery, outcome measurement and reporting.            1\n",

Peers with experience of homelessness offer unique perspectives in supporting those experiencing homelessness. Peer support fostered and developed by professional organisations, termed intentional peer support (IPS), formalises this process. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of IPS as an intervention with young adults and adult homeless persons (including streetdwelling and those within services). PyscINFO, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were searched, resulting in ten studies, involving 1,829 participants. Peer support has significant impacts on quality of life, drug/alcohol use, and social support. Common elements of peer support are identified, suggesting possible processes that underlie effective peer support. Shared experiences, role modelling, and social support are suggested to be vital aspects of peer support and moderate changes in homeless clients. One study was deemed to have moderate/high quality; the remaining studies had low and moderate quality. Limitations of each are discussed.            1\n",

Homeless adult women and unaccompanied homeless youth make up the most marginal segments of this population. Because homeless individuals are a hard to reach population, research into these marginal groups has traditionally been a challenge for researchers interested in substance abuse and mental health. Network analysis techniques and research strategies offer means for dealing with traditional challenges such as missing sampling frames, variation in definitions of homelessness and study inclusion criteria, and enumeration/population estimation procedures. This review focuses on the need for, and recent steps toward, solutions to these problems that involve network science strategies for data collection and analysis. Research from a range of fields is reviewed and organized according to a new stress process framework aimed at understanding how homeless status interacts with issues related to substance abuse and mental health. Three types of network innovation are discussed: network scale-up methods, a network ecology approach to social resources, and the integration of network variables into the proposed stress process model of homeless substance abuse and mental health. By employing network methods and integrating these methods into existing models, research on homeless and unstably housed women and unaccompanied young people can address existing research challenges and promote more effective intervention and care programs.            1\n",

PRISMA standards for systematic reviews were used to search five databases as well as grey literature. There were four inclusion criteria; studies had to involve a description of an external (i.e. outside of the home) mental health or psychosocial intervention/treatment, must be focused in LAMIC, must be focused on CASS, and must empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention described. A quality assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias in included articles. Five studies were included. A multidisciplinary care approach was significant in reducing psychological distress, substance use and improving sleeping arrangements (p < 0.001, n = 400). Residency step programmes were on average 52% successful in reintegrating children back into communities (n = 863). Resilience training significantly increased psychological well-being components (p < 0.001, n = 60). Emotional regulation training had a beneficial improvement in emotional regulation. FORNET (Forensic Offender Rehabilitation Narrative Exposure Therapy) (n = 32) reduced the number of self-reported offenses committed [t(19.26) = 1.81, p = 0.043]. There are not enough credible studies available to develop a firm conclusion on the effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial interventions delivered to CASS in LAMIC. The limited amount of studies, inconsistent outcome measures, interventions and imperfect study designs maintain that this is an area in need of greater attention and research focus.            1\n",

Research suggests that linking health care to H/UH adolescents might help improve their continuity of care, with most preferring to access health care information via the Internet. YTH StreetConnect is a dual-purpose mobile app that helps H/UH youth access health and vital services in Santa Clara County, CA, USA. We developed YTH StreetConnect PRO in parallel with the youth app as a companion tablet app for providers who serve H/UH youth. The objective of our study was to develop a mobile app to support H/UH youth and their providers in accessing health and vital resources, and to conduct usability and feasibility testing of the app among H/UH youth and technical consultants with local expertise in serving H/UH youth. Formative research included a literature review on H/UH youths' mobile phone and Internet usage. In January 2015, we conducted interviews with medical and service providers of H/UH youth. Usability and feasibility testing were done with target audiences. Additionally, we conducted focus groups with youth regarding the app's youth friendliness, accessibility, and usefulness. H/UH youth and their providers noted the app's functionality, youth friendliness, and resources. Usability testing proposed improvements to the app, including visual updates to the user interface, map icons, new underrepresented resource categories, and the addition of a peer rating system. Limitations included a small sample size among H/UH youth and providers and a single site for the study (Santa Clara County, CA), making the findings ungeneralizable to the US population. YTH StreetConnect is a promising way to increase service utilization, provide referral access, and share resources among H/UH youth and providers. Input from H/UH youth and providers offers insights on how to improve future models of YTH StreetConnect and similar programs that assist H/UH youth.            1\n",

Without empirical data on these reasons, the policies developed or implemented to mitigate street involvement are not responsive to the needs of these children and youth. OBJECTIVE: To systematically analyze the self-reported reasons why children and youth around the world become street-involved and to analyze the available data by level of human development, geographic region, and sex. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of Scopus, PsychINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, PubMed, ERIC, and the Social Sciences Citation Index were conducted from January 1, 1990, to the third week of July 2013. We searched the peer-reviewed literature for studies that reported quantitative reasons for street involvement. The following broad search strategy was used to search the databases: “street children” OR “street youth” OR “homeless youth” OR “homeless children” OR “runaway children” OR “runaway youth” or “homeless persons.” STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) participants were 24 years of age or younger, (2) participants met our definition of street-connected children and youth, and (3) the quantitative reasons for street involvement were reported. We reviewed 318 full texts and identified 49 eligible studies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. We fit logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the pooled prevalence of each reason and to estimate subgroup pooled prevalence by development level or geographic region. The meta-analysis was conducted from February to August 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We created the following categories based on the reported reasons in the literature: poverty, abuse, family conflict, delinquency, psychosocial health, and other. RESULTS: In total, there were 13 559 participants from 24 countries, of which 21 represented developing countries. The most commonly reported reason for street involvement was poverty, with a pooled-prevalence estimate of 39% (95% CI, 29%-51%). Forty-seven studies included in this review reported family conflict as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 32% (95% CI, 26%-39%). Abuse was equally reported in developing and developed countries as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 26% (95% CI, 18%-35%). Delinquency was the least frequently cited reason overall, with a pooled prevalence of 10% (95% CI, 5%-20%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The street-connected children and youth who provided reasons for their street involvement infrequently identified delinquent behaviors for their circumstances and highlighted the role of poverty as a driving factor. They require support and protection, and governments globally are called on to reduce the socioeconomic inequities that cause children and youth to turn to the streets in the first place, in all regions of the world.            1\n",

Poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization. Numerous variables may affect level of treatment engagement, including therapeutic alliance, accessibility of care, and a client's trust that the treatment will address his/her own unique goals. As such, we have found that the concept of recovery-oriented care, which prioritizes autonomy, empowerment and respect for the person receiving services, is a helpful framework in which to view tools and techniques to enhance treatment engagement. Specifically, person-centered care, including shared decision making, is a treatment approach that focuses on an individual's unique goals and life circumstances. Use of person-centered care in mental health treatment models has promising outcomes for engagement. Particular populations of people have historically been difficult to engage, such as young adults experiencing a first episode of psychosis, individuals with coexisting psychotic and substance use disorders, and those who are homeless. We review these populations and outline how various evidence-based, recovery-oriented treatment techniques have been shown to enhance engagement. Our review then turns to emerging treatment strategies that may improve engagement. We focus on use of electronics and Internet, involvement of peer providers in mental health treatment, and incorporation of the Cultural Formulation Interview to provide culturally competent, person-centered care. Treatment engagement is complex and multifaceted, but optimizing recovery-oriented skills and attitudes is essential in delivery of services to those with serious mental illness.            1\n",

Homelessness services are often the first to know when children are at risk of disengagement with health, welfare and education services. Changes to Australian policy to explicitly attend to the needs of children are attempts to address the complexity of, and provide better outcomes for, homeless children. There are mounting levels of evidence describing some of the needs of children who are homeless. Using the scoping study methodological framework, this review of academic and grey literature identified the extent to which service providers provide for the needs of homeless children. The literature search was conducted from September 2012 to April 2013 using ProQuest, Science Direct, Sage and OVID databases. Therefore, the objectives of this scoping study were to: (i) identify the specific needs of children in homelessness; (ii) describe recent changes in policy relating to care for children in homelessness services; (iii) explore the evidence on how service providers can enact care for children in homelessness services; (iv) identify the types of practice changes that are needed to optimise outcomes for children; and (v) identify the gaps in service delivery. This article describes the Australian policy changes and explores the potential impact of subsequent sector reforms on the internal practices in front‐line homelessness services, in order to overcome structural and systemic barriers, and promote opportunities for children in homeless families. This scoping study literature review contributes to the understanding of the impact of policy change on front‐line staff and suggests possible practice changes and future research options.            1\n",

Despite being significant users of hospital emergency department (ED) services for acute and ongoing health needs, little is known about their experiences of ED care and the factors affecting their ED use. This study used a grounded theory and community-based approach to examine these issues. Focus groups and individual interviews were facilitated with 48 SI youth between ages 15 and 26 years, recruited in hospital or through community agencies serving SI youth in a major Western Canadian city. Results demonstrate that SI youth often perceived suboptimal care and experienced long waiting periods that led to many avoiding or prematurely exiting the ED. Service gaps appeared to have a negative bearing on their care and health outcomes. Findings invite a critical review of ED care processes, structures, and staff interactions in the aim of enhancing ED services to SI youth.            1\n",

To develop responsive interventions, we must understand their mental health/behavioral needs. The purpose of this systematic review was to update the evidence base by identifying, appraising, and summarizing studies on the prevalence of mental health issues among homeless children, comparing these individuals to low-income–housed children, and discussing research, practice, and policy implications. Method We searched 3 electronic databases and included empirical studies investigating the prevalence of mental illness in homeless children in the United States (1990–2014). Retrieved publications were screened, data extracted, and study quality appraised by independent reviewers. Evidence synthesis was based on qualitative and quantitative analyses. Prevalence odds ratios (OR) of individual studies were pooled using an inverse-variance random effects model. Results Twelve studies were included and reviewed. Overall, 10% to 26% of homeless preschoolers had mental health problems requiring clinical evaluation. This proportion increased to 24% to 40% among homeless school-age children, a rate 2 to 4 times higher than poor children aged 6 to 11 years in the National Survey of America’s Families. According to our meta-analyses, the difference in prevalence measured by Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Problems (T score ≥60–64) was not significantly different between homeless and housed preschool children (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 0.97–2.28). School-age homeless children compared to housed children were significantly more likely to have a mental health problem as defined by the CBCL Total Problems subscale (T score ≥60; OR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.19–2.66). Conclusion Evidence-based mental health interventions for children experiencing homelessness are long overdue. Universal screening, treatment plan development, and support of adaptive systems that focus on positive parenting and children’s self-regulation are essential.            1\n",

These students are highly at-risk for experiencing negative life outcomes, and they face considerable academic and social-emotional functional impairments. To help address the complex needs of homeless students, this article reviews the intersection of laws and practices that impact homeless students, as well as contemporary school-based service delivery efforts to support the academic and social-emotional needs of these students. In addition, this article also reviews several barriers to school-based service delivery for homeless students and ways to overcome these barriers. These barriers include confusion regarding consent and record-sharing procedures, ineffectively utilizing homeless liaisons, and misapplying tenants of Multitiered Systems of Support (MTSS), which is a school-based service-delivery framework that has been adopted by and implemented in many U.S. schools. Ultimately, this article aims to provide members of school communities with practical information that they can use to support the homeless youth they encounter and serve.            1\n",

Canada has a noteworthy reputation for high quality health care. Nonetheless, street youth are one of our most vulnerable yet underserved populations. Consequently, a medical and dental clinic was created in downtown Ottawa, Ontario to respond to their needs. The purpose of this study is to describe a process evaluation of the clinic during its first year of operation with a focus on program fidelity, dose, reach, and satisfaction. A mixed methods approach was used involving interviews with providers, focus groups with street youth, analysis of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, and supplemental information such as document reviews. The evaluation identified areas that were working well along with challenges to program implementation. Areas of concerns and possible solutions were presented to the management team that then helped to plan and make improvements to the clinic. Our evaluation design and working relationship with clinic management promoted the integration of real-time evidence into program improvements.            1\n",

This naturalistic, retrospective study describes an intervention (Transitional Supportive Housing and Case Management) that effectively promoted treatment admission for this high-risk group above and beyond that which could be explained by certain pretreatment factors. The clinical records of 211 military veterans referred to intensive outpatient addiction treatment were reviewed for factors related to treatment program admission, including 3 interventions designed to prevent waiting list attrition. Chi-square tests evaluated univariate predictors of treatment entry, and a hierarchical binary logistic regression evaluated several variables simultaneously. Results showed that fewer than 50% of wait-listed patients achieved treatment admission. Univariate predictors of treatment entry were not having a current partner, having a legal problem, and having had past substance use disorder treatment. The logistic regression showed that patients who received the intervention were 4.5 times more likely to enter the treatment program, and individuals with a current legal problem were 2.5 times more likely to enter treatment. Participation in a weekly support group and/or contact with a psychiatric nurse practitioner did not increase the likelihood of program admission. It may be possible to enhance treatment entry for the homeless and marginally housed by providing case management and housing services. Future research is needed to determine how the individual-level factors predicting treatment entry in this study can be used to tailor other interventions to further address the problem of waiting list attrition.            1\n",

Method For trafficked children, children of and on the street, children of conflict/disaster, and institutionalized children, a systems framework approach was used to organize the topic of sustainable approaches in low- and middle-income countries and addresses the following: legislation, policies, and regulations; system structures and functions (formal and informal); and continuum of care and services. The article draws on the findings of a focal group convened by the U.S. Government Evidence Summit: Protecting Children Outside of Family Care (December 12–13, 2011, Washington, DC), tasked with reviewing the literature on systems, strategies, and interventions for sustainable long-term care and protection of children with a history of living outside of family care in low- and middle-income country contexts. The specific methodology for the review is described in the commentary paper ( Higgs, Zlidar, & Balster, 2012 ) that accompanies these papers. Results For the most part, the evidence base in support of sustainable long-term care for the populations of interest is relatively weak, with some stronger but unreplicated studies. Some populations have been studied more thoroughly than others, and there are many gaps. Most of the existing studies identify population characteristics, needs, and consequences of a lack of systemic services to promote family-like care. There is some evidence of the effectiveness of laws and policies, as well as some evidence of service effectiveness, in improving outcomes for children outside of family care. Conclusions Despite the weaknesses and gaps of the existing research, there is a foundation of research for going forward, which should focus on developing and implementing systems for these most vulnerable children. The evidence reviewed indicates that child protection systems should aim for appropriate, permanent family care (including reunification, adoption, kinship care, or kafalah ) for children in order to secure the best environment for a child's developmental prospects. Evidence also suggests that the quality and duration of care, including both permanent family care and alternative care, are important regardless of setting. The diversity of political, socioeconomic, historical, regional, community, and cultural contexts in which child protection systems operate need to be taken into account during programming and research design.            1\n",

In light of the tremendous need for identifying effective strategies to end homelessness and its associated problems among youth, this paper summarizes and critiques the findings of the extant literature including U.S., international, and qualitative studies. Thirty-two papers met criteria for inclusion in the review. Among the conclusions are that comprehensive interventions which target the varied and interconnected needs of these youth and families may be worthy of more study than studies that isolate the intervention focus on one problem. Also, more research incorporating design strategies that increase the reliability and validity of study findings is needed. Other preliminary conclusions and future directions are offered.            1\n",

A systematic and comprehensive international review on effective interventions for homeless youth is presented. This study seeks to provide an accurate and complete picture of effective interventions for homeless youth by collecting, summarizing, categorizing, and evaluating quantitative studies (i.e., those that have assessed treatment outcomes). Evidence acquistion: The following databases were searched in 2008: PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched from 1985 through 2008 using specific key words: interventions and programs, with homeless youth (s), homeless adolescents, street youth (s), runaways and throwaways. In addition, references of key articles were searched by hand. Eleven studies met pre-established inclusion criteria. To determine study quality, a set of operational parameters was formulated to rate each study as either good, fair, or poor. Evidence synthesis: There is no compelling evidence that specific interventions are effective for homeless youth, owing to moderate study quality and the small number of intervention studies. Conclusions that can be drawn from the studies are limited by the heterogeneity of interventions, participants, methods, and outcome measures. Many interventions focused on reduction of substance abuse, whereas other important outcomes, such as quality of life, have received little attention. No study received a quality rating of good, and four studies were rated as fair. Most convincing, but still marginal, were results of interventions based on cognitive–behavioral approaches, which revealed some positive results on psychological measures. Conclusions: More methodologically sound research is needed to determine what specific interventions are beneficial for subgroups of homeless youth. Implications for future research are discussed.            1\n",

We searched databases for peer-reviewed English articles published from 1985 to 2011 and found 21 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies comparing case management to other services. We found little evidence for the effectiveness of ICM. SCM improved housing stability, reduced substance use, and removed employment barriers for substance users. ACT improved housing stability and was cost-effective for mentally ill and dually diagnosed persons. CTI showed promise for housing, psychopathology, and substance use and was cost-effective formentally ill persons. More research is needed on how case management can most effectively support rapid-rehousing approaches to homelessness.            1\n",

The aim of the present analysis is to explore questions raised in the systematic review over the potential role of service engagement in mediating outcomes of relevant interventions. Objective: The paper summarises engagement-related findings from quantitative intervention evaluations with street-connected populations of children and young people, as reported by study authors. It seeks to contribute to theoretical and methodological understandings of service engagement with street-connected youth populations and to highlight gaps in current knowledge. Methods: Drawing on the original search for the Cochrane-Campbell review, we re-screened search results in our database and included quantitative findings if relevant to our current research questions, regardless of study design. Additionally, we sought new study publications from authors whose work was included in the original systematic review. The discussion explores relevant data from five studies included in the original systematic review, ten studies excluded from the review, and two studies published after the completion of the review. Results: The measures of service engagement in the included studies focused on treatment attendance, 'level of engagement', and service satisfaction. Evidence on the impact of service engagement on other outcomes in interventions for street-connected children and young people was limited. Available data on the predictors and impact of service engagement were mixed and appear not to provide robust support for common hypotheses in the relevant context.            1\n",

Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. The quality of included studies was analyzed using explicit and well-validated criteria. Interventions evaluated ranged from individual-focused therapies such as brief motivational intervention, community reinforcement approach, and knowledge and skills training, to broader interventions such as family therapy, support groups, and shelter-based health care and housing programs. Participants reported improvements in substance use outcomes over time in most of the studies. However, the superiority of a specific intervention is difficult to determine because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and the few studies conducted on each intervention. Implications for practice and research are discussed.            1\n",

In this article, we review existing literature to provide a background for educational leaders, researchers, and policymakers hoping to understand the phenomenon of adolescent homelessness, how it affects students at school, and the various strategies used to address it, including a broad consideration of the effects of adolescent homelessness in and beyond the school context. We also review methods that educators can use to address the problem of homeless youth, including advocating for the needs of this population in a larger policy context.            1\n",

With a phenomenological qualitative emphasis, the mixed methods study explored the perceptions of parents and children experiencing homelessness regarding their academic needs and the services they considered to be helpful. The researchers also examined archival data associated with an after school tutoring program offered at an agency that works with families experiencing homelessness. A paired samples t test indicated a significant difference the number of failed courses for participants in the tutoring program over a one-year period. Difference in grade point average was not significant over the same period of time.            1\n",

Despite this trend, few studies have explored the effectiveness of housing interventions and housing and service interventions. The purpose of this systematic review is to appraise and synthesize evidence on effective interventions addressing family homelessness. We searched 10 major electronic databases from 2007 to 2013. Empirical studies investigating effectiveness of housing interventions and housing and service interventions for American homeless families regardless of publication status were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes included housing status, employment, parental trauma and mental health and substance use, children's behavioral and academic status, and family reunification. Study quality was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. Six studies were included in this review. Overall, there was some postintervention improvement in housing and employment, but ongoing residential and work stability were not achieved. Methodological limitations, poor reporting quality, and inconsistent definitions across outcomes hindered between-study comparisons. Substantial limitations in research underscore the insufficiency of our current knowledge base for ending homelessness. Although many families were no longer literally homeless, long-term residential stability and employment at a livable wage were not ensured. Developing and implementing evidence-based approaches for addressing homelessness are long overdue.            1\n",

In his conclusion Dybicz pleads for more empirical research addressing the effectiveness of interventions and capturing the voices of different actors involved in intervention programs in a culture and gender sensitive way. Our review began with a broad search for academic literature on interventions for CASS published between December 2004 and October 2011 in English, Portuguese and Afrikaans. We ordered the findings derived from 33 studies in an ecological broad-based integrative model to have an idea about what we can learn from the academic literature. In a second part of this article we attend to the effectiveness of interventions. One of the main conclusions of this review is that the reviewed articles could not give us a clear picture of what is meant by the long-term objectives of interventions for CASS, which is of paramount importance in evaluating them. Furthermore, we noticed that a Western discourse on childhood is predominantly used in the reviewed articles and in the programs described. Finally, we question whether this is the ideal to which we have to interpret the results of the programs.            1\n",

Despite the widespread urgency of the issue, there is a lack of general coherence in the research about how diverse conditions of homelessness affect students and how schools and communities can best serve them. This literature review attempts to deepen scholars’ understandings of such matters by examining (a) homeless students’ school experience in comparison to that of other students, (b) federal policy’s shaping of homeless students’ rights and opportunities, and (c) homeless students’ key support mechanisms. The author suggests that these three focus areas provide foundational insights into the nature and extent of students’ opportunities to succeed in school. Although homeless students’ experiences are noted to be similar to those of residentially stable low-income students, they appeared to be distinguishable based on their high rates of isolation and school mobility. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act was found to have profound formative influences on the wider field of practice, but its full implementation is limited by the disconnected nature of students’ diverse support mechanisms. Based on the findings, the author suggests that researchers and practitioners consider the people, places, and policies that affect students in more holistic manners—as networks of practice.            1\n",

Both in developed and developing countries there is a large proportion of people who do not know they are infected with HIV. Knowledge of one's own HIV serostatus is necessary to access HIV support, care and treatment and to prevent acquisition or further transmission of HIV. Using telephones instead of face-to-face or other means of HIV test results delivery could lead to more people receiving their HIV test results. To assess the effectiveness of telephone use for delivery of HIV test results and post-test counselling.To evaluate the effectiveness of delivering HIV test results by telephone, we were interested in whether they can increase the proportion of people who receive their HIV test results and the number of people knowing their HIV status. We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), WHOs The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We also searched grey literature sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International,CAB Direct Global Health, OpenSIGLE, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and AEGIS Education Global Information System, and reference lists of relevant studies for this review. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (qRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone HIV test results notification and post-test counselling to face-to-face or other ways of HIV test result delivery in people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. Out of 14 717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria; an RCT conducted on homeless and high-risk youth between September 1998 and October 1999 in Portland, United States. Participants (n=351) were offered counselling and oral HIV testing and were randomised into face-to-face (n=187 participants) and telephone (n=167) notification groups. The telephone notification group had the option of receiving HIV test results either by telephone or face-to-face. Overall, only 48% (n=168) of participants received their HIV test results and post-test counselling. Significantly more participants received their HIV test results in the telephone notification group compared to the face-to-face notification group; 58% (n=106) vs. 37% (n=62) (p < 0.001). In the telephone notification group, the majority of participants who received their HIV test results did so by telephone (88%, n=93). The study could not offer information about the effectiveness of telephone HIV test notification with HIV-positive participants because only two youth tested positive and both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group. The study had a high risk of bias. We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients' and providers', its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification.            1\n",

It was established as a result of evidence from service users and practitioners which suggested that this group of women were unlikely to access mixed emergency accommodation and found it hard to engage with more structured routes into support. The Novas Scarman Group provides a range of services to women and men in housing need within Bristol. Their services include a large women’s hostel which provides services to 150 women annually. Additional consultation about the Night Service provision took place with service providers from One25, Second Step, Alabare (The Well), caring at Christmas and representatives from Safer Bristol. Funding was obtained from the Supporting People Innovations Fund and a donation from Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). Before the project was implemented, it was also fully discussed with relevant neighbourhood partnerships and organisations, including The Compass Centre, St Paul’s Community Partnership, the Hostel Review Group and the Street Sex Workers Action Group. Existing links with the agencies to whom onward referrals were likely to be made were renewed, and a multi-agency advisory group was established to work with the project. Members of this group were drawn from One25, Second Step, English Churches Housing Group Outreach, Streetwise, The Well and the local police force.            1\n",

The studies reviewed in this chapter represent laudable efforts on the part of researchers, practitioners, and community partners to engage in intervention studies with the challenging and understudied population of children in families experiencing homelessness. However, within the guidelines of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards for evidence-based practices, none of the interventions represented in these studies have sufficient evidence to be rated as having Positive Effects. Most often, this is due to lack of quality evidence that evaluates the program outcomes. Policymakers, funding agencies, researchers, clinicians, and community practitioners can expand the evidence base for interventions with homeless children through understanding what constitutes quality evaluations and supporting high-quality research. This chapter concludes with recommendations for building a robust and rigorous evidence base of what works to allow stakeholders to improve the well-being of at-risk children, bettering their lives through increasingly effective and efficient programs.            1\n",

Using data drawn from two national surveys and follow-on qualitative studies, the authors trace urban myths of rurality and their effects on runaway provision. The authors review models of rural refuge, systemic advocacy and mobile services for rural runaways. Evidence suggests that both young runaways’ services and young runaways themselves are particularly at risk of stigmatisation in the rural context. The authors suggest that in this context of high visibility in a rural area, add-on services to generic provision may offer a solution.            1\n",

However, youth transitioning into adulthood have not received similar attention. These older youth have frequently been overlooked by policymakers and practitioners who have been more focused on designing programs and services for adolescents and young children. Because older youth face a unique set of challenges and risks as they move into adulthood, it is important to identify intervention strategies that can enhance the development and success of these individuals in domains such as employment, independent living, drug and alcohol use, pregnancy, parenting, life skills, mental health, release from the foster care system, homelessness, violence, education, and literacy. This synthesis examines the role that programs designed to serve older youth can play in promoting positive development and subsequent self-sufficiency in adulthood. The authors synthesize the findings from 31 studies that implemented random assignment intent-to-treat experimental evaluations to examine the impacts of various intervention strategies on youth well-being outcomes during the transition to adulthood (ages 18 to 25). While all programs evaluated outcomes for these \"emerging adults,\" programs varied in the ages of targeted youth: 10 programs targeted youth from as early as 12 years and into their early twenties; eight programs served youth from 16 years and into their early twenties; and 11 programs began at 18 years of age. This review of experimental evaluations indicates that education and career programs can be effective, especially for low income youth and for youth targeted from younger ages, for example, those under age 18. Furthermore, specific intervention strategies, such as mentoring, case management, and providing child care for young parents, are associated with program success across outcomes. However, existing substance use and reproductive health programs have not consistently been found to be effective across outcomes for this age group.            1\n",

When it was decided to convene such an event, Project Forum and NCHE jointly developed the purpose and expected outcomes. In July 2007, NCHE and the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY) conducted a survey with state coordinators for the education of homeless students regarding collaboration between homeless education, early intervention and special education program administrators. In September 2007, Project Forum conducted a similar survey with state directors of special education, 619 directors (those who serve students with disabilities ages three through five), and LEA special education and early intervention administrators. The questions asked in both surveys were: (1) What are some specific issues that have caused confusion regarding school placements and services for children with disabilities who are homeless?; (2) What, if any, coordination or collaboration has occurred between you and your [homeless program liaison or special education/early intervention] liaison?; (3) What activity/resource/opportunity was most helpful in developing a collaborative relationship with your [homeless or special education/early intervention] program liaisons?; (4) What have been the most challenging barriers to collaboration with [homeless or special education/early intervention] staff?; and (5) What suggestions do you have for colleagues regarding how they can build strong collaborative relationships across these programs? The information gleaned from these surveys guided development of the policy forum. This document contains the following: 1) the need for, and description of, the policy forum; 2) a review of laws pertinent to the education of students with disabilities who are homeless; 3) a summary of the collaborative process designed specifically for IDEA and homeless education administrators; and 4) the findings from the policy forum. These findings include both barriers to collaboration and recommendations to overcome these barriers in order to better serve this student population.

When a child becomes homeless, schools are federally mandated to identify these students and provide the same access to a free and appropriate education as their non-homeless counterparts. Within a historical and legal context a review of federal and state legislation that addresses the education of homeless children and youth will be conducted. This paper will provide an overview of the history of homelessness in the United States, specifically its impact on homeless children and youth and its relationship to education. It will outline a critical analysis of The Chicago Public School Systems' response to these federal and state laws in an effort to demonstrate the need for continued support, advocacy and enforcement of homeless educational policy.            0\n",

In response to a mandate for a review of the grant award process for these programs in the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110-378), GAO examined (1) grant announcements and application requirements, (2) technical assistance for grant applicants, (3) how grant award decisions are made, and (4) notification of grant award decisions. GAO reviewed requirements, documents, and records associated with this process for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, observed the grant evaluation portion of this process, and interviewed applicants, peer reviewers, and agency officials.            0\n",

Although the role of the social determinants of health has been recognized for many years, there is a gap in our knowledge about the strategies needed to address these factors in health promotion. Drawing on a review of literature on health promotion for marginalized and out-of-school adolescents, this paper highlights some urgent areas of focus for researchers and policy makers addressing adolescent health. Social determinants of health affecting marginalized adolescents identified by the review were education, gender, identity, homelessness, poverty, family structure, culture, religion and perceived racism, yet there is little solid evidence as to how to best address these factors. More systematic research, evaluation and global debate about long-term solutions to chronic poverty, lack of education and social marginalization are needed to break the cycle of ill health among vulnerable adolescents.            0\n",

Wayne Osgood, E. Michael Foster, and Mark E. Courtney examine the transition to adulthood for youth involved in social service and justice systems during childhood and adolescence. They survey the challenges faced by youth in the mental health system, the foster care system, the juvenile justice system, the criminal justice system, and special education, and by youth with physical disabilities and chronic illness, as well as runaway and homeless youth. One problem is that the services these vulnerable populations receive from these systems as children and adolescents often end abruptly as they transition to adulthood, even though the need for them continues. Youth must leave systems tailored for clients their age and, if they are eligible for further services at all, enter adult systems that are not equipped to address their needs. One exception is the special education system, whose services extend into early adulthood and are designed for individuals' needs. The authors review current public policies directed toward vulnerable youth in transition and find problems in four areas: eligibility criteria that exclude youth from services that might benefit them, inadequate funding for transition services, a lack of coordination across service systems, and inadequate training about young-adult developmental issues for service professionals. The authors then discuss policy options that can help create a developmentally appropriate and socially inclusive system of support for vulnerable youth. Among the options are strengthening all programs for youth in transition, improving the existing systems of care for children and adolescents, addressing the loss of access to services at the age of majority, and coordinating today's multiple systems into a single coherent system. The authors see heightened governmental interest in better supports for vulnerable young adults, both through expanding the federal role in their lives and through improving coordination of the systems that serve them. The Fostering Connections Act of 2008, for example, extended services to adolescents in foster care from the age of eighteen to the age of twenty-one.            0\n",

This book reaffirms CSL's philosophical foundations in an era when CSL has been appropriated by a number of different perspectives. Sheffield (foundations of education, Missouri State U.) reviews the conceptual history of CSL and explains its core principles (community, service, experiential learning, and reflection), connecting philosophic and practical implications. At the same time, the author presents a defense of practical philosophy as a viable research method. He makes the case for incorporating a critical perspective into CSL to make it more transformative for individuals, schools, and communities, drawing on his 14 years of experience teaching high school in an impoverished community in Florida. An appendix lists books and papers on CSL outcomes. The book is for teachers, school administrators, educational scholars, and students. (©2011 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR)            0\n",

Among these effects, there is exasperating evidence of comprised community networks, a deterioration of family and social ties, psychiatric co-morbidity, suicides and more recently, homelessness. In this context, individual, structural and social vulnerabilities become important markers in understanding the dynamics involved. From a social critical perspective of the literature review, we will highlight some of the major psychosocial stakes underlining the social construction of gambling as pathology. Following a brief definition of the concept of vulnerability, the focus of this paper will be placed on the following issues: 1- the discourse on individual pathology as a marker for vulnerability, 2- the social and ethical contradictions of governments when managing gambling, 3- the heated debate about youth gambling, suicide and Internet gambling, 4- a cultural vulnerability among Asian communities as a demonstration that addiction is a multi factorial phenomenon versus the disease model. Finally, we propose markers for empowerment that can contribute to transferring some power to individuals and their social networks and advance the debate on the complex issues that gambling represents in our society.            0\n",

It is not recognised that they are inappropriate for obtaining information about the poorest of the poor. Typically, they omit by design: those not in households because they are homeless; those who are in institutions; and mobile, nomadic or pastoralist populations. In addition, in practice, because they are difficult to reach, household surveys will typically under-represent: those in fragile, disjointed or multiple occupancy households; those in urban slums; and may omit certain areas of a country because of security considerations. This article reviews estimates of the numbers of children in each sub-group, focussing on countries endorsed by the Fast Track Initiative, and estimates that 21 million rather than 14 million children are out-of-school in those countries; and that worldwide 115 million rather than 67.5 million are out-of-school. Methods of improving population counts are briefly discussed.            0\n",

This study examined school counselors’ involvement in partnership practices and interventions to meet the needs of students who are homeless. Further, this study explored relationships between school counselors' preparation to work with students who are homeless, their perceived knowledge of McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and their involvement in partnership practices and interventions to work with students who are homeless. An online questionnaire, which was a combination of the School Counselor Involvement in Partnerships Survey (SCIPS) and the revised Knowledge and Skills with Homeless Students Survey (KSHSS) was emailed to a random sample of American School Counselor Association (ASCA) members. Further, PREVIEW descriptive statistics and regression analyses were run to determine relationships between variables. The results of the study suggested that school counselors are involved in practices to support students who are homeless that are more individual and school-based. They are involved less in practices that require collaboration and partnerships. The results of this research also suggest that there are relationships between school counselors’ perceptions of their specific knowledge of homelessness, self-efficacy, and advocacy role and their involvement in interventions and partnership practices to support students who homeless            1\n",

Since then, Kozol has written eleven more books which focus on such issues as segregation in schools and society, poverty, inequitable school funding, effective teaching and curriculum choices that help create good citizens and good learners, teacher leadership in matters related to social justice, literacy, and homelessness.

Homeless young children (under the age of 5) are especially vulnerable as early childhood professionals consider the early years to be the most critical developmental period in all domains (cognitive, social-emotional, physical, and language). The disruptions to a sense of stability and security and the lack of cognitive stimulation that comes with homelessness have a large impact on young children and their development. This article defines homelessness, summarizes what we know about the experiences of homeless children, reviews some of the educational rights offered to them, and offers a few strategies in working with homeless children and their families.            0\n",

Having the skills to manage healthy intimate partner relationships can make a difference as youth make decisions related to school, employment, pregnancy prevention, and establishing strong relationships. These skills may be especially important for youth involved in or aging out of the child welfare system. This document reviews the research and evaluation evidence on relationship education for youth in foster care, discusses the needs of disadvantaged young people around intimate partner relationships, summarizes research on the implications of relationships for child development, identifies common ground and also gaps in the research, and identifies opportunities to further improve relationship skills among these disadvantaged young people. For the purposes of this review, the authors sought to focus primarily on relationship education programs that aim to improve romantic relationships among adolescents in foster care. Given the paucity of work on this topic, however, they expanded their review to consider research and evaluation studies among youth outside the foster care system as well as those in foster care. In addition, they have assessed evaluations in related areas, for example, interventions aimed at improving social skills more generally, positive youth development interventions, and pregnancy prevention programs.            0\n",

The findings and recommendations in this report are based upon the culmination of that testimony, interviews with experts, and review of available research. Studies show that up to 85 percent of youth in juvenile detention facilities have disabilities that make them eligible for special education services, yet only 37 percent receive these services while in school.  A disproportionate percentage of these detained youth are youth of color. These statistics should lead to the conclusion that many disabled youth in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems are deprived of an appropriate education that could have changed their School-to-Prison Pipeline trajectory. NCD has concluded that IDEA can and should be an important part of the solution to the School-to-Prison Pipeline crisis. Thus, the recommendations in this report focus on ways to improve existing special education delivery and enforcement systems to better meet the needs of students with disabilities who risk entering the Pipeline.            0\n",

It explores the major challenges faced by homeless minors, and, drawing from recent research by IRP affiliates, looks at the major factors that contribute to a young person or family becoming homeless, including a shortage of affordable housing and rising rents. Also explored is federal legislation that seeks to protect homeless children and youth, and to ensure their access to education while they find permanent housing; and policy suggestions for the future. In conducting his literature review and research, Damron received guidance and mentoring from IRP affiliate Peter Miller (Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis), and consulted in particular the research of Matthew Desmond (Sociology, Harvard University).            0\n",

This song/video uses a fictionalized account of a pregnant 12-year-old African American girl to chronicle the ecological realities of life in the inner city (e.g., teen pregnancy, drug addiction and trafficking, incest, poverty, dysfunctional families, lack of opportunity, ineffective educational and welfare systems, runaway youth, commercial sexual exploitation, violence, and a racially insensitive law enforcement response). Because of the complexity and convergence of multiple issues and social problems in Brenda’s life, and their impact across the micro–macro spectrum, this song/video is an effective anchor for a semester-long emphasis on a critically conscious approach to theory. This article (a) reviews hip-hop as a vehicle for pedagogy; (b) explores Tupac’s early history and approach to information dissemination; and (c) discusses underlying assumptions and application in BSW-, MSW-, and PhD-level theory courses.            0\n",

Meanwhile, the U.S. public school system is struggling to meet the educational needs of their homeless students. Objective: This study examined the historical trajectory of U.S. federal initiatives that aim to respond to the needs of homeless youth; homeless youth research, classifications and typologies; homeless youth social conditions; and the factors that foster or impede their education. Methods: This study reviewed U.S. federal policies that intend to address homeless youth needs and education; the causes and impact of homelessness on youth; the economics of homelessness; and the relevance of resiliency in improving homeless youth prospects. Results: Despite the enormous challenges homeless youth face, some manage to successfully graduate from high school. While homeless youth are incapable of building or institutionalizing the support networks and structures they need, they are capable of utilizing available support systems within their surroundings. Conclusion: Without responsive structural support this vulnerable population is at high risk of failure. Several federal programs are mandated to assist homeless youth meet their basic needs and education. For these programs to realize their objectives, deliberate efforts must be expanded to assess and evaluate program efficiency. Also, past federal educational initiatives may offer insights on how to better chart and inform the many existing federal homeless youth programs that aim to meet the diverse and complex needs of homeless students.            0\n",

This systematic review collates, summarizes, and appraises published studies reporting the rates of perpetration of property offenses and property victimization, and associations between homelessness and these outcomes. A comprehensive search of psychology, sociology, and health electronic databases, including PsycINFO and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) was conducted. Search terms included “homeless*,” “adol*,” “youth*,” “offend*,” “victimization,” and variations to the terms “offending” and “victimization.” Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes could be calculated for five reviewed studies. Findings suggested homeless youth engage commonly in either theft or property damage. Burglary and having personal property damaged were the most commonly reported victimization experiences. Several studies reported associations between homelessness and property offenses. Research investigating situational antecedents that contribute to the likelihood of property offenses and property victimization in homeless youth is required.            0\n",

This is alarming because homeless students face significant barriers to their academic success and positive life outcomes. Unfortunately, despite the significant risks and challenges they face, homeless students often are overlooked and not provided with important educational and social-emotional supports. In addition, information on student homelessness is relatively limited in the school psychology literature and practice guidelines, which can forestall efforts to help these students. To date, only a few empirical articles have been published on student homelessness in school psychology journals and in practitioner-related literature. To help address this paucity, this article discusses barriers to the academic success of homeless students, as well as ways to reduce these barriers. Additionally, important protective factors, resilience, and ways to overcome homelessness-related stigma are reviewed. Lastly, ways that school psychologists can become key stakeholders in efforts to help support the academic and life success of homeless students are discussed. The overall goal for this article is to encourage school psychologists to redouble their efforts to support a highly at-risk yet often neglected student population.            0\n",
